00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,200
Welcome to this course,
introduction to MongoDB.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,720
This course is part of our
specialization, MongoDB

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,450
Analytics, which has been
designed to provide you

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,660
with a broader understanding
of how to fully utilize

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,830
MongoDB from a data science
and analytics perspective.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,140
Obviously, we need to
start from the beginning

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,690
and provide you with
the knowledge foundation

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,260
on how MongoDB works, how
to operate with MongoDB,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,420
and where it fits
your development

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,380
practices before starting a
full fledged MongoDB journey.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,910
In this course, you will learn
the fundamentals of MongoDB

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,520
that are needed to fully
understand how to leverage

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,550
its power to perform analytics.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,090
These fundamentals will include
topics like MongoDB's document

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,660
model, importing data
into a MongoDB cluster,

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,150
or working with the
MongoDB CRUD API,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,850
alongside with an introduction
to B's Aggregation framework.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,220
These topics will
be explained to you

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,730
by the means of a demo
application, Mflix,

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,070
which is a video
streaming application

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,310
similar to popular online
streaming services.

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,830
This will give you a
great first encounter

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,150
of how simple and practical it
can be to build applications

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,100
with MongoDB.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,340
In addition to these
essential topics,

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,120
you will also learn and work
with useful MongoDB tools

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,740
and services.

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,250
Especially, you will
work with MongoDB Atlas,

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,030
our database as a
service, MongoDB Compass,

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,420
our schema visualization
tool, as well as

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,810
many other useful
command line utilities.

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,460
This course is for newcomers
to the MongoDB family,

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,970
so no prior MongoDB
expertise is expected.

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,390
That said, we do have some
technical requirements

36
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,460
that you should be aware of.

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,400
We will be expecting you
to know about Python,

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,890
the most beautiful
language in the world.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,660
This is the language of choice
throughout this specialization.

40
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,840
We will ask you to have
Python 3 environments set up

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,580
in your workstation.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,880
Finally, I just want
to welcome you again

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,920
to this first course on MongoDB.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,740
We hope that you enjoy the
material we prepared for you,

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,830
and we wish you
the best of luck.

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,170
And I'll see you in class.
