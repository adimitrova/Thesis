1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,740
One advantage of using MongoDB for data
science is that it is trivial to get data

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,540
into MongoDB, and easy to change your
data model as needed to support analysis.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,960
With our data in MongoDB,
we can take advantage of indexes,

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,100
the MongoDB query language, and

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,020
the aggregation framework to manipulate
and explore data efficiently,

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,470
as we work to better understand and
refine our requirements.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,850
MongoDB provides a free tier option
in Atlas, which is perfect for

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,980
getting started.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,300
Atlas is a MongoDB hosting service
provided by the people who built MongoDB.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,100
It's easy to migrate data from the free
tier to production scale databases

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,430
when you're ready.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,370
To get started, please sign up for

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,070
MongoDB Atlas, visiting the link provided
in the lecture notes for this lesson.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,300
We'll be loading some initial data
sets that we will clean up and

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,980
begin analyzing as soon as we're
done creating an Atlas cluster.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,350
Please create an account and
save your credentials somewhere.

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,360
Once you've submitted
an account creation form,

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,770
you'll be prompted to create a group.

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,420
Atlas uses groups to enable you to
control who has access to your data.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,470
As is often the case, you can grant
full read write access to some users

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,830
such as the data scientists on your
team and read only access to others.

22
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,280
Please enter analytics as the group name.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,560
Throughout this course, we'll give you
pretty specific instructions on set up

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,960
tasks such as this so that if you have
trouble, it's easy to diagnose the issue.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,150
Once you've created a group,
you'll be taken to a screen like this.

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,770
Please note that as with all websites,
Atlas is actively developed.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,850
The user interface you see may look
a little different from what we see here.

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,680
Note also, that Atlas uses Intercom, and

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,860
you might see a welcome message
when you first create an account.

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,886
Now, don't be nervous about the fact
that you see a cost here under pricing.

31
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:06,760
Just select M0 here, under instance size,
and you'll see the price go to zero.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,770
Also, let's name this cluster mflix.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,250
This is the name of the app we'll be
building as we move through this course.

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,990
Once you've named the cluster and
selected M0 as the instance size,

35
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,891
please scroll to the bottom of this modal.

36
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:30,627
And create an administrative user
with the username analytics,

37
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:34,493
and the password, analytics-password.

38
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:38,825
We'll use these credentials to connect to
this MongoDB cluster from Python scripts

39
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,910
and applications later in this course.

40
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,630
Now, if the term cluster is
unfamiliar to you, don't worry.

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,320
All you need to know at this point is
that a cluster provides redundancy.

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,760
The cluster we are creating is actually
three MongoDB database servers.

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,350
This a safeguard to make sure your
data is always available to you.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,466
While the probability is small on
something going wrong on any given day,

45
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:06,280
computers crash, network connections
break, and other problems emerge.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,901
Having a cluster rather than
just a stand alone instance

47
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,410
ensures that you'll be
able to access your data

48
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,140
even if something bad happens to
one of the servers in our cluster.

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,350
The client libraries we will use from
Python will automatically switch

50
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,940
to one of the other servers if for
some reason it could

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,900
no longer communicate with the one
it was reading from and writing to.

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,060
This is called automatic failover.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,480
All nodes in the cluster
maintain copies of your data, so

54
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,980
it really doesn't matter which
one your application uses.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,040
All this is handled for you automatically.

56
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,220
You probably won't even
notice of a failover happens.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,748
Okay, with that little bit of
context about what a cluster is,

58
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:46,780
click Confirm & Deploy to
initiate the creation process.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,143
You might see a captcha pop up.

60
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:52,273
Simply do what it asks you to do, verify.

61
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,470
It will take a minute or two for
your clusters to be created.

62
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,830
While we wait,
let's ensure we can access our cluster

63
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,620
once we begin to write
a little Python code.

64
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,250
Click the Security tab,
then click the IP-Whitelist tab.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,170
Click the Add IP Address button And then
the Allow Access from Anywhere button.

66
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,090
And finally, Confirm.

67
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,000
Atlas allows us to restrict access to a
cluster to specific IP address ranges to,

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,920
for example, ensure only computers
in a specific corporate network

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,280
can connect to the cluster.

70
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,616
Allowing access from anywhere
will make it easy for

71
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:35,059
you to access MongoDB from wherever you
are and simplifies access for this course.

72
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:39,260
You will still need to supply a username
and password to access the cluster.

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,530
Now, click the Clusters tab and wait for
your cluster to finish initializing.
