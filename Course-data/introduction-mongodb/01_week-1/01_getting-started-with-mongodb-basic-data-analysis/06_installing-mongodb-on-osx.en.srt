1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,820
Compass doesn't yet
fully support the MongoDB query language.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,900
So in order to explore all
CRUD operations in MongoDB,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,280
we're going to need to
install the Mongo Shell.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,010
The Mongo Shell is a text based client
that we'll be using by means of

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,960
whatever command line interface you
have available to you on your system.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,340
In this lesson,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,670
we'll take a look at how to install
the Mongo Shell on a Mac OS X system.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,150
If you're on Windows,
please see the video for

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,640
installing the Mongo Shell
on Windows systems.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,001
Now to install the Mongo Shell,
we're actually going to go ahead and

11
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,980
just install all of
MongoDB Enterprise Server.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,270
Enterprise Server is bundled
with a number of executables

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,640
that are part of the MongoDB ecosystem,
including the Mongo Shell.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,850
So please visit the MongoDB
download center,

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,050
you can get there with
a single Google query.

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,850
Click the Enterprise Server tab, and
then select your operating system.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,040
In this case, we want to select OS X 64.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,170
Now please follow these
installation instructions,

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,280
even if you already have
a version of MongoDB installed.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
Earlier versions of the Mongo Shell
did not support SSL, and

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,440
we need SSL support in order
to connect to Atlas clusters.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,720
Once you've selected your
operating system, click download.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,080
Now you might see a contact form pop up.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,800
If you do see a contact form,
please complete it, and

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,550
then download Enterprise Server.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,660
Once the download completes, we can open
the Finder and navigate to Downloads.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,670
Here's the file we just downloaded,
I'm going to move it to my home directory.

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,870
Now if I navigate to my home directory,
we can see the file right here.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm going to double-click it,
and unpack the archive file.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,400
Then if I look inside this
folder I can see that there is,

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,580
in addition to some licensing information,

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,960
a bin directory that contains
a number of executable files.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,220
The executable file we are interested
in is this one, mongo.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,260
This is executable for the Mongo Shell.

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,061
Please don't confuse this with mongod,

36
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:22,130
mongod is the executable for
the MongoDB server itself.

37
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,890
So when we say that we have
a MongoDB deployment running,

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,560
it's running one or more mongods.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,050
Again, we're interested in
the Mongo Shell or the mongo executable.

40
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,030
Please place the download that you've
unpacked into your home directory,

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,170
as I've done here.

42
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,110
That will make following these
instructions a little simpler.

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,670
Now in order to conveniently
run the Mongo Shell,

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,480
we're going to have to update
our PATH environment variable.

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,920
The PATH tells OS X where to look for
programs that we'd like to run.

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,670
You can set your PATH in a hidden
file called .bash_profile.

47
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,200
If I open up Sublime Text and
select Open, I can see hidden files

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,760
on my Mac by typing Cmd+Shift+Dot.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,260
Then if I navigate to my home directory,
I can see that there is,

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,910
in fact, a .bash_profile.

51
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,840
Now on your system,
you might not have a .bash_profile.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,170
If you haven't created one previously,
you probably don't.

53
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,450
Don't be alarmed if you don't see one.

54
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,630
You can easily create
one by simply creating

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,390
a new file in your favorite text editor,

56
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,150
and then saving it as .bash_profile.

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,760
Make sure that you save it
in your home directory.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,342
Don't save it on the desktop,
don't save it anywhere else.

59
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,380
Make sure you save it
in your home directory.

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,230
You can simply click Save, and

61
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,520
a .bash_profile file will be created for
you.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,848
I already have one, so I'm simply
going to open the one that I have.

63
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:15,766
Again, it's Cmd+Shift+Dot
to see hidden files.

64
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:21,860
And there's my .bash_profile,
again, in my home directory.

65
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,630
If I open this, we can see that
there is one bash command in here.

66
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,000
This command sets the prompt for
my terminal application.

67
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,234
Now in order to use the Mongo Shell,

68
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:37,050
we're going to run it from
a command line interface.

69
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,061
The terminal application
ships with Mac OS X, so

70
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,200
that's the one that I'm going to use.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,100
And one thing I'll point out here is
that you can see my prompt is dollar and

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,240
then a space.

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,935
That's because my bash profile
specifies that the prompt for

74
00:04:54,935 --> 00:05:01,745
terminal, or for any bash shells,
should be dollar followed by a space.

75
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:06,310
A dive into bash,
a dive into using command line interfaces

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,350
other than the Mongo Shell is a little
bit outside the scope of this course.

77
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,410
So if you'd like to dive deeper on this,

78
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,370
there are any number of tutorials on
bash and the terminal application.

79
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,110
Or, if you're on Windows,
the Command shell or PowerShell.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,920
Any number of tutorials available
online that I would encourage you

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,110
to take a look at.

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,220
So in order to run
the Mongo Shell conveniently,

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,010
we want to setup our PATH
environment variable.

84
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,980
When you have a Terminal application open,

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,290
at any point you can look at environment
variables that have been set.

86
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,260
For example,
if I'd like to see what PS1 is,

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,400
I can do that simply by typing echo $PS1.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,900
You must use the $ character in order
to stipulate that you want to see

89
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,980
the value of that environment
variable that's defined.

90
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,720
I can do the same thing with
the PATH environment variable.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,140
And here I can see that it is setup to
some standard system directories where

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,050
executable files or programs are found.

93
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,100
This is so that I can run a number of
commands from the terminal, including

94
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,790
a number of system programs that make the
command line interface really work for me.

95
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,340
What I'd like to do is
update our PATH to include

96
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,900
the location where we just put MongoDB.

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,350
As a reminder, that's in my home
directory under this folder and

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,330
inside the bin subdirectory.

99
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,053
Now I've got an existing PATH,
that's all of this,

100
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,470
and I don't want to blow that away.

101
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,558
So I need to make sure
that in updating my PATH,

102
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:48,510
I maintain all of those directories
as well, as part of the PATH.

103
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,990
The way we do that is
through a command like this.

104
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,852
So here I'm saying, as the value
of the PATH environment variable,

105
00:06:55,852 --> 00:07:00,480
use this sequence of directories.

106
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,515
So this simply means my home directory,
and

107
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:08,366
then with in my home directory,
that long download name for MongoDB.

108
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,706
And just as a convenience,
don't try to type it,

109
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:12,728
because you'll probably
screw something up.

110
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:17,484
Just right-click and select Copy,
and that will copy the name of

111
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:22,510
that directory for you, and
then you can easily paste it in.

112
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:29,043
So my home directory,
the name of the download/bin, okay?

113
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:32,150
And then,
you'll see that I have a colon here.

114
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,170
That colon says everything
that follows is another

115
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,040
directory in which to look for
executable programs.

116
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,795
So what this is saying is anytime
a user requests to run a program,

117
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:55,845
look for that program first
in Shannon's home directory,

118
00:07:55,845 --> 00:08:02,058
mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.4.6/bin.

119
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:05,258
So look here first, and then,
if you don't find it there,

120
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,636
continue on looking in other directories.

121
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:13,010
Now by specifying $PATH here,
don't forget the $,

122
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,220
what we're saying is take
all of these directories,

123
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,550
note that they're all separated
themselves by colons, and put them here.

124
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,150
The PATH is always searched in order,
so this will be searched first, and

125
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,830
then each of the directories that
are listed following this directory,

126
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,900
following this colon,
will be searched in sequence afterward.

127
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm asking you to put the directory we
just downloaded first in your PATH so

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
that if you happen to have
a prior installation of MongoDB,

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,410
when attempting to run the Mongo Shell
Because the first place the system will

130
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,160
look is in that directory we just
downloaded, that is the version of

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,200
the Mongo Shell that will be run, not some
version that you installed previously.

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,370
So if we save this, then our bash
profile is updated with the new PATH.

133
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,720
The last thing that I need to point
out about this is that your PATH in

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,890
the terminal won't be updated until
the next time you launch a terminal,

135
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,010
or unless you run a special command.

136
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:19,130
So if I echo $PATH again, we'll see that
it's exactly the same as it was before.

137
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,500
However, it I type source ~/.bash_profile,

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,125
what that does is reads my bash
profile that I just updated..

139
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,501
And then, if I echo $PATH,

140
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:38,870
now we see that that new directory
we added is included in the path.

141
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,410
What this does for
us is ensures that all of these executable

142
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,320
files can be found if we type
their name here in the shell.

143
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,550
So now if I type mongo, and

144
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm going to add the --nodb command
line option, and you see that?

145
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,560
What happened is exactly what
I cautioned you against.

146
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,420
And that is that I haven't correctly
specified that folder in which our

147
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,205
downloaded version of MongoDB exists.

148
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:15,076
So I'm going to go back into the Finder,
and

149
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,110
I'm going to select Copy.

150
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,510
And then I'm going to go
back into Sublime, and

151
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,455
I'm going to update my PATH
with the correct value.

152
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:30,270
I'm going to save it, and then I'm
going to source bash profile again.

153
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,510
And now if I check my PATH, we can
see that it's been updated correctly.

154
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,060
And now if I run Mongo, I can see
that it does in fact start up for me.

155
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,400
What we've walked through here is how
to download MongoDB Enterprise package.

156
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,730
We've talked about the fact that the Mongo
Shell is bundled with the Mongo server and

157
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,909
a number of other executables.

158
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,796
We've walked through how to setup
our PATH environment variable so

159
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:59,900
that we can run
the Mongo Shell from anywhere.

160
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,410
And I've cautioned you against
a couple of things that can go

161
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,670
wrong when we're trying
to set up the PATH.

162
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,450
So it turns out that, given the steps
we followed, we actually have

163
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,660
both the correct version and
the incorrect version here in our PATH.

164
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,480
Because we were simply concatenating

165
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,600
whatever was here onto the front
of what was already the PATH.

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,650
But don't worry because if I
simply start up a new shell,

167
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,330
you'll see that just
the correct one is there.

168
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,630
So on new invocations of
the Terminal application,

169
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,590
I'll pick up exactly what I want from
my PATH, and I'll be able to run nodb.

170
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,650
We look at a few more tips about how
to use the Terminal application and

171
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:49,220
go a lot deeper into how to use
the Mongo Shell in other lessons.

172
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,172
One last thing before we close this lesson
is that if you have any trouble at all

173
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:59,980
installing MongoDB on your OS X
environment, please visit the MongoDB

174
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,900
documentation for detailed instructions
on installing MongoDB Enterprise.

175
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,440
In addition to OS X, there are detailed
instructions for installing

176
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,860
MongoDB Enterprise on Linux and all the
various flavors of Linux, and on Windows.

177
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,120
And again, the Windows installation
is covered in another lesson.
