1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,513
Compass doesn't yet fully support
the entire MongoDB query language.

2
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:08,983
So, in other to do some of
the lessons in this course,

3
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:12,410
we're going to need to
use the Mongo Shell.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,827
The Mongo Shell is a text based client
that fully supports all MongoDB CRUD

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:17,689
operations.

6
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:18,560
In this lesson,

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,370
I'm going to walk you through installing
the Mongo Shell on a Windows machine.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,026
Here we have a Windows 10 environment.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,685
I'll also show you some of the subtle
differences you'll encounter when

10
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,050
installing on Windows 7.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,529
There aren't many and
you should be fine on Windows 10 or

12
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:39,288
on older versions of Windows, provided
they are 64 bit versions of Windows.

13
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, to install the Mongo Shell, we are
actually going to install MongoDB itself.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,513
We are going to install
the enterprise server.

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:50,275
The Shell comes packaged with
the server as part of the download from

16
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,330
MongoDB Download Center.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,794
So please navigate to the Download Center.

18
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:57,990
And then, instead of Community Server,

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,300
let's click the Enterprise Server tab,
and I will select Windows.

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,360
Now, this is very important.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,350
Even if you already have MongoDB
installed, please go through these steps.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,068
Earlier versions of MongoDB in the Shell
did not provide support for SSL.

23
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:24,960
And we're going to need SSL support in
order to connect to our Atlas cluster.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,633
So select Windows 64 and then Download.

25
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,994
Now, if you haven't previously
accessed the Download Center,

26
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,960
you'll be asked to
complete a Download form.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,408
Please just enter your details there and

28
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,507
then move through to
downloading the Windows MSI.

29
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:44,410
Now we're presented with two options here,
either archive or msi.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,690
Please select msi, and again,

31
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,530
it's Enterprise Server,
Windows 64, and then msi.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,080
And we'll just wait for that to download,
and once it does, we can Install.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,483
And once the msi downloads,
we can click it and

34
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:07,167
then use the installation
wizard to install MongoDB.

35
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,690
Select Complete and then Install.

36
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,096
Allow the app to make changes to
our device and then we Finish.

37
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:18,787
Now it's important that you understand
where MongoDB was installed on your

38
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,000
computer.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,090
So if you click Windows Explorer,
and then, scroll down to Local Disk.

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,490
On your machine, the download location
should be something like the following.

41
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,576
C colon, Program Files,

42
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:39,229
MongoDB, Server, 3.4.

43
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,604
And then if we click the 3.4 directory,
we'll see that there is some license

44
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:46,950
information, but
most importantly is this bin directory.

45
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,669
The bin directory contains all of
the executables that are distributed with

46
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:53,996
MongoDB's server.

47
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:57,280
The one we're interested in is Mongo.

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,793
Now note that it's very
similar in name to Mongod,

49
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:04,152
which is the executable for
the MongoDB server.

50
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:08,026
For this course,
we will be using the Mongo Shell,

51
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:11,980
which is run from the Mongo executable.

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,699
Okay, before we can run Mongo, we're
going to need to open a command shell.

53
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,372
Now regardless of whether you're
working on a Windows 10 machine or

54
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,940
an older version of Windows.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,358
You have a text box you can type in,
and if you type Cmd,

56
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:30,750
you'll note that the command
prompt is suggested for us.

57
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,685
If we hit Enter,
then what pops up is a command line

58
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:39,100
interface from which we'll
execute the Mongo Shell.

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,771
Again, the Mongo Shell is
a text based environment.

60
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:47,816
I can do something very similar on
Windows 7 by clicking the Start button,

61
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:52,230
and then in the search box,
typing cmd, and hitting Enter.

62
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,926
And again,
I get a command shell that pops up.

63
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:59,744
Switching back to Windows 10, everything
I do here you can also do on earlier

64
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,380
versions of Windows, such as Windows 7.

65
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,963
The command shell is largely the same in
most versions of the Windows operating

66
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:07,525
system.

67
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:12,020
At least, it's the same for our purposes
in the ways that we will be using it.

68
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,013
So if you take a look at what's been
printed in the shell, you'll see it says,

69
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:18,613
C:\Users\shannon.

70
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:22,552
This is simply a folder in the file
system for my Windows machine.

71
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:29,824
And I can find that folder if I
look in C colon, Users, shannon.

72
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,993
So, C:\Users\shannon,

73
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:38,730
is exactly this folder,
C colon, Users, shannon.

74
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,060
Now if I want to run the Mongo Shell
on many versions of Windows,

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,805
I need to do one additional step, and
that is I need to set up my path.

76
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:52,440
If you've never done this before,
don't be worried about it.

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,100
It's a pretty straightforward process, but
it is down in the weeds a little bit, so

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,954
we'll take it one step at a time.

79
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:03,675
So to do this, I can type,
system environment,

80
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:08,150
and just to be complete, variables.

81
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,707
And long before that, Windows will
have suggested this operation,

82
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:13,865
Edit the system environment variables.

83
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:18,495
If I click on that, what I'll see is a
window that pops up for System Properties,

84
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,710
and the Advanced tab is already selected.

85
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,992
If I click Environment Variables,

86
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:28,488
then you'll see that I have User
environment variables for shannon.

87
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:34,458
And System environment variables, the one
we're interested in is this one, Path.

88
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:41,200
And if we select Path and click Edit,
we'll see a list of folders.

89
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,000
These folders contain executable files,
or programs,

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,401
that can be run on this Windows machine.

91
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,690
Now, on Windows 10,

92
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,500
it's probably not strictly necessary that
we update the environment variables.

93
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,493
But on many versions of Windows,
it is necessary, so

94
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,695
I'm going to show you how to do it here.

95
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:06,104
Now as we said previously, MongoDB is
installed in C colon program files.

96
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:11,421
MongoDB, Server, 3.4, and all of
the executables are in the bin directory.

97
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:18,786
So again, that's C:, Program Files,
MongoDB, Server, 3.4, bin.

98
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:23,715
The way that that folder structure
is represented in our path is

99
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:28,370
by separating each component
of the path with a backslash.

100
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:35,021
So for our path, that looks like this,

101
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:43,204
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin.

102
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:47,999
Finally, what I'd like to do, before we
finish editing this environment variable,

103
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,320
is move this to the top.

104
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,992
In order to understand
why I wanted to do that,

105
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,947
let's talk a little bit
about how the path is used.

106
00:06:55,947 --> 00:07:00,117
When I'm in the shell and I type
a command, like mongo, again, remember,

107
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:03,670
mongo is the name of
the Mongo Shell executable.

108
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,192
Windows will look for
programs with that name in each one of

109
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:12,087
the folders listed here,
and it does so in order.

110
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:16,706
So, it will first check this path to see
if there are any executables located

111
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:17,730
there.

112
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,262
In this case, it will find one
called Mongo and execute it.

113
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:26,009
The reason why I wanted to place the
MongoDB installation directory first is

114
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,770
just in case you have an older
version of MongoDB installed.

115
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,470
Because if you have an older
version of MongoDB installed,

116
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,932
chances are it's in your path.

117
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:40,480
And you might accidentally end up running
that version of the Mongo Shell instead.

118
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,737
Again, earlier versions of the Mongo Shell
did not include support for SSL, and

119
00:07:44,737 --> 00:07:45,745
we need that here.

120
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,170
So we really need to be running
the latest version of the Mongo Shell.

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,148
Which you can download from
the MongoDB Download Center as part of

122
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,254
the MongoDB Enterprise Package.

123
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:55,670
So we can click OK here.

124
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,628
And now you'll note that our Path
has been updated to include that

125
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:06,591
individual path that we just added,
and it's added at the front.

126
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:13,851
And note that it's separated from the next
item in the path by a semicolon, here.

127
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:17,685
This is one of those difference
points from Windows 7.

128
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:22,351
And by that I mean,
in editing a path in Windows 10,

129
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:26,313
you have this nice list
of items in your path.

130
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:31,600
In Windows 7, it's a little bit more
arcane, for lack of a better word.

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,433
Because in order to change
the environment variable,

132
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,859
we actually need to edit a string.

133
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:41,370
That includes all of the components
of a path in one line.

134
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,081
So here I can do exactly the same thing,
system environment.

135
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,120
And before I'm even finished typing,

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,220
Windows is suggesting the right
thing to me, I click on it.

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,678
Again, it's System Properties,
Advanced tab selected,

138
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,720
I click on Environment Variables.

139
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,574
And then, if I scroll down here,
I can open my Path and

140
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,950
Edit, but see here, this is what I mean.

141
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,679
We just have one line of text.

142
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,858
These are all of the same elements of
the path that we saw in Windows 10.

143
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:16,310
But rather than being on separate lines,
they're all in one line.

144
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,477
In order to update a path using
this older UI, I can copy in my C:,

145
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:27,875
Program Files, MongoDB,
Server, 3.4, bin path.

146
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:35,290
And then type a semicolon, so that it is
separated from the next item in my path.

147
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,453
With that, I can click OK, OK, OK, and

148
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:43,745
then I've updated my path on Windows 7.

149
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:47,030
Returning to Windows 10,
I want to do the same thing.

150
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,416
Click OK, and then what I want to
do is restart the command prompt.

151
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,904
Because on many versions of Windows, it's
only after I restart the command prompt

152
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:03,980
that those changes I made to the path
environment variable will be reflected.

153
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,556
So I'm going to close that.

154
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:09,120
And I'll just start it the same way,
typing command, and then hitting Enter.

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,803
And now I'll be able to
execute the Mongo Shell.

156
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:17,230
So to verify that we've
installed it correctly, and

157
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,655
that we've set up our path correctly,
what I'm going to do is type mongo --nodb.

158
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,335
Now --nodb simply means
that we're just starting up

159
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:31,890
the Mongo Shell without attempting
to connect to any MongoDB database.

160
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,414
We're doing this simply as
a means of verifying that we've

161
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:40,291
installed the Mongo Shell correctly, and
that we've set up our path correctly.

162
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:45,203
And if you see a message such as this,
MongoDB shell version 3.4.6, or

163
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:49,910
later, depending on when you're
actually doing this install.

164
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,721
As we roll out the next version of
MongoDB, your version number may change,

165
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,895
but you should see a message
very similar to this.

166
00:10:57,895 --> 00:11:01,180
You have successfully installed
the Mongo Shell and launched it correctly.

167
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,538
To quit the Mongo Shell, you can simply
type quit, you can run the function quit.

168
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,807
And that's it for
installing the Mongo Shell, and

169
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:15,510
getting set up to do a number of different
CRUD operations in the Mongo Shell.

170
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,597
For the sake of completeness,
I'll do the same thing in Windows 7,

171
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:26,052
so I close the command prompt,
launch it again, and run mongo --nodb.

172
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,020
And here we can see that we have
a slightly different start up message.

173
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,054
This is pointing you to documentation, and

174
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:35,252
to Google groups where
you can ask questions.

175
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:38,350
Before we close out,
I want to say one last thing.

176
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,172
If for any reason,
you have trouble installing MongoDB.

177
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:51,200
Please visit the MongoDB documentation for
installing MongoDB Enterprise on Windows.

178
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,241
This is a simple Google query away, and

179
00:11:54,241 --> 00:12:00,058
there's extensive documentation for
how to install MongoDB on Windows.

180
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:04,473
You can, of course, also ask for
help in the discussion forum.

181
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,790
But before posting, please make sure you
do a search in the forum to see whether

182
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,010
your question has already been asked and
answered.
