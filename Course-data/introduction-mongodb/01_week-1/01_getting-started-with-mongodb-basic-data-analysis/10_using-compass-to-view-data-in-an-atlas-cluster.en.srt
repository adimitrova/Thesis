1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
Now let's view the data we just loaded.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,780
For this and
a number of other tasks in this course,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,490
MongoDB Compass is the best option.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,880
Compass is a GUI client for MongoDB
that enables you to view databases,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,910
filter data using queries,
modify data as needed and much more.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,810
To download Compass,
let's visit the MongoDB Download Center.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,080
I will just Google for it here.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,100
Click the Compass tab, and make sure
you select the right distribution for

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,800
your operating system.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,560
I'm running on a Mac, so I will
download the latest version for OSX.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,220
Once downloaded, go ahead and
install compass.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,040
It should launch upon install, but

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,530
in case it doesn't,
just use Spotlight to launch it.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,190
Compass should launch once
installed on Windows, but

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,105
in case it doesn't,
just click search and type compass.

16
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,525
Once launched, you'll see
a connect screen similar to this.

17
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,295
Now, Compass is actively developed, so
exactly what you see in the Compass UI

18
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:59,955
might differ from what it
is as I record this video.

19
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:05,535
To connect to your free tier cluster,
visit the cluster page for

20
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:06,525
your Atlas account.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,550
Click Connect, and
click Connect Your Application.

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,420
Go ahead and copy the URL connection
string, and then go back to Compass.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,110
You should see a model that
asks you whether you want to

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,170
use the connection string you just copied
to connect Compass to MongoDB cluster.

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,430
Go there and do this.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,060
Compass will populate nearly all
the fields in the connection form.

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,060
You just need to type the password for
our analytics user.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,420
Remember, that is analytics-password.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,350
Now, all of the details you
need to fill in this form

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,070
are included in the lecture notes for
this lesson.

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,850
So don't worry if Compass didn't pop up

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,380
the model asking you if you simply wanted
to copy in what was in the clipboard.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,443
At the very bottom of the connect form,
enter Analytics Free-Tier,

34
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:02,510
and click Create Favorite, so

35
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,110
that you can easily reconnect to your
free-tier atlas cluster at any time.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,340
Now, I'll click Connect, and you'll see
that I'm presented with three databases.

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,380
The admin and
local databases are created by default and

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,720
are used by MongoDB for
internal bookkeeping.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,890
The database we created when we
loaded data set using Mongo import

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,660
is called mflix.

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,060
Click mflix.

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,988
You then see that the mflix
database contains one collection

43
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:36,024
called movies_initial with
46,014 documents in it.

44
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:40,330
In MongoDB, documents are like
Rose in a relational database.

45
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,580
And documents are organized
together in collections.

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,310
Much in the same way that Rose make
up tables in a relational database.

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,188
Each document in a collection
is a distinct record.

48
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:58,701
In the movies_initial collection,
each document stores data for one movie.

49
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:01,540
Now click movies_initial.

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,420
In the documents view that loads,

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,560
you can scroll through
the documents in this collection.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,740
Note the fields and
basic shape of the documents.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,220
In the coming lessons, we'll be doing some
data cleaning and reshaping of the schema

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,980
in order to better enable
an application and analytics.

55
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,200
For example, note that the genre
field is a simple string

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,140
containing a comma
separated list of genres.

57
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,620
This makes it difficult to partition
documents based on the genre.

58
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,680
We'll do something about that
in a number of other fields.
