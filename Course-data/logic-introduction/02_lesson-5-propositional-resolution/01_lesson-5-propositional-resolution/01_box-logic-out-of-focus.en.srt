1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,609
In this segment we're gonna take a look at
box logic. Unfortunately, we cannot do

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:12,810
that here on the studio so we're gonna
have to take a road trip. Today we're

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:20,841
headed for Stanford University's renowned
logic laboratory. Follow me. And here we

4
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:26,252
are. This is the logic laboratory. It may
not look like much at least not

5
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:32,113
superficially but this is where we
investigate some of the latest innovations

6
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:38,425
in logic technology. Today our goal was to
look at box logic. Now the language of box

7
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:44,437
logic is pretty simple. There are really
just three constants. There is large box,

8
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:50,448
there is medium box, and there is small
box and they are all oriented one way or

9
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:57,999
the other. Forming compound sentences from
our consonants is easy. If we want to

10
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:05,421
negate a sentence, we just invert. Not
medium box, medium box. If you want this

11
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:12,767
form of this junction from our constants,
we stack them up. So here we have small

12
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:19,204
box or medium box. And a conjunction is
formed simply by placing multiple boxes or

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:25,198
stacks of boxes on our table. So it's
effectively colossal for. Okay. Now, let's

14
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:31,899
try to use our logic to solve some
problems. How about the problem case of

15
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,156
Mary Patton Quincy? We call that. If it's
Monday, Mary loves Pat or Quincy and

16
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:41,747
Quincy, if Mary loves Pat, Mary loves
Quincy. Let's see how we can represent

17
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:46,648
that information using our new language.
So first of all, if Mary loves Pat, Mary

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:51,611
loves Quincy let's, let this medium sized
box represent the fact that Mary loves

19
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,777
Pat. This one represents Mary loves Quincy
and the large one is going to be Monday.

20
00:01:56,777 --> 00:02:02,010
So we wanna say, if Mary loves Pat, Mary
loves Quincy. How do we do that? Recalling

21
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,306
the rules for converting to colossal form,
we know that p implies q as equivalent to

22
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:13,851
not p or q. So if you wanted to write
that, we would write not Mary loves Pat or

23
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:20,869
Mary loves Quincy. So, not Mary loves Pat
or Mary loves Quincy. If Mary loves Pat,

24
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:28,534
Mary loves Quincy. How about our other
sentence? If it's Monday, then Mary loves

25
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:36,298
Pat or Quincy. It's Monday, let's see. We
need to say not Monday or Pat or Quincy.

26
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:43,173
So it's not Monday mo re quick copies. Or
Pat or Quincy. So there we have it. If

27
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:48,544
it's Monday, Mary loves Pat or Quincy. If
Mary loves Pat, Mary loves Quincy,

28
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:54,504
represented, representing the premises of
the problem. Now you may recall that the

29
00:02:54,504 --> 00:03:00,700
object of the problem was to show that if
it's Monday then Mary loves Quincy. So how

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,004
could we do that? What we have done is
representing but we can also do

31
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:12,141
computation, deduction with box logic. Any
rules are pretty simple. If we ever have

32
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:17,815
one stack which has a constant. Literal
which is the complement of literal on

33
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:23,165
another stack, we can do resolution on
them. So here we have one stack with

34
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:28,443
medium box down, here one stack with
medium box up. We can combine the two

35
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:34,299
stacks and eliminate the complementary
literals and form these answers and since

36
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,010
it's a duplicate, we can throw that one
away and we're left with our conclusion.

37
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,536
If it's Monday, Mary loves Quincy, nifty.
Okay, what's the point? The point is that

38
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,746
the language of logic is not about
particular sets of symbols. And the active

39
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:56,024
deduction doesn't mean necessarily that
we're operating upon those particular

40
00:03:56,024 --> 00:04:01,166
symbols. Logic is an abstraction. Any
instantiation of the symbols is equally

41
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:06,918
good and any operations on them is equally
good provided that it respects that basic

42
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:11,969
abstraction. Okay. That's it for our visit
to the logic laboratory today. We'll be

43
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,018
back again later in the course with some
additional demonstrations and we'll see

44
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:17,580
you then.
