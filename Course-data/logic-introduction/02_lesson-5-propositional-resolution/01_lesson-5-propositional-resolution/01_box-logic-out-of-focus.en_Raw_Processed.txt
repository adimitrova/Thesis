in this segment gonna take a look 
box logic unfortunately, we cannot 
that here studio so gonna 
to take a road trip today 
headed stanford universitys renowned 
logic laboratory follow here we 
this is logic laboratory may 
look like much least 
superficially this is we 
investigate latest innovations 
in logic technology today goal to 
look box logic language box 
logic is pretty simple there really 
three constants there is large box, 
there is medium box, there is small 
box oriented one way 
forming compound sentences 
consonants is easy if we want to 
negate a sentence, we invert 
medium box, medium box if you want this 
form this junction constants, 
we stack so here we small 
box medium box a conjunction is 
formed simply placing multiple boxes 
stacks boxes table so 
effectively colossal okay now, lets 
try to use logic to solve 
problems problem case 
mary patton quincy we call that if 
monday, mary loves pat quincy 
quincy, if mary loves pat, mary loves 
quincy lets see we represent 
that information using new language 
so first all, if mary loves pat, mary 
loves quincy lets, let this medium sized 
box represent fact that mary loves 
pat this one represents mary loves quincy 
large one is going to monday 
so we wanna say, if mary loves pat, mary 
loves quincy we that recalling 
rules converting to colossal form, 
we know that p implies q equivalent to 
p q so if you wanted to write 
that, we would write mary loves pat 
mary loves quincy so, mary loves pat 
mary loves quincy if mary loves pat, 
mary loves quincy 
sentence if monday, mary loves 
pat quincy monday, lets see we 
need to say monday pat quincy 
so monday mo re quick copies 
pat quincy so there we if 
monday, mary loves pat quincy if 
mary loves pat, mary loves quincy, 
represented, representing premises 
problem you may recall that 
object problem to show that if 
monday mary loves quincy so 
could we that we done is 
representing we also 
computation, deduction box logic 
rules pretty simple if we ever 
one stack a constant literal 
is complement literal 
another stack, we resolution 
so here we one stack 
medium box down, here one stack 
medium box we combine two 
stacks eliminate complementary 
literals form answers since 
a duplicate, we throw that one 
away left conclusion 
if monday, mary loves quincy, nifty 
okay, whats point point is that 
language logic is 
particular sets symbols active 
deduction doesnt mean necessarily that 
operating upon particular 
symbols logic is an abstraction 
instantiation symbols is equally 
good operations is equally 
good provided that respects that basic 
abstraction okay thats visit 
to logic laboratory today well 
back later in course 
additional demonstrations well see 
you
