00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,230
Finally as an exercise in using some of
the concepts introduced in this section,

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,106
let's consider the following problem.

3
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:19,994
Stanford people always tell the truth and Berkeley people always lie.

4
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:24,343
Unfortunately, by looking at a person you cannot tell whether he is from Stanford or Berkeley.

5
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:34,370
You come to a fork in the road and want to get to the football stadium down one fork, or you did not know which road to take.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,283
There is a person standing there. What
single question can you ask him to help

7
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:46,742
you decide which fork to take? There are a
number of ways to approach this problem

8
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:52,112
most interesting involves a question in
which a person is asked. How we would

9
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:57,272
answer if you were from Stanford or if you
were from Berkley. However, we can also

10
00:00:57,272 --> 00:01:02,265
approach this problem without entertaining
such meta-level questions. Let's draw out

11
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:06,410
a table with the set of all possible
states of affairs, and leave columns for

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:13,939
the question we want to ask and the
response we want to receive. We want to ask a

13
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:19,448
question that will list of one response.
Let's say true or one, if the stadium is

14
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:25,071
to the left, and a different response, For
example, false or zero, if the stadium is

15
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:30,436
to the right. Note that the response
in each case may differ from the actual

16
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:34,674
truth of the question depending on whether
the informant is from Stanford or from

17
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:41,678
Berkley. Now, let's see what the actual
truth value or question must be to have

18
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:47,383
elicited this response. If the stadium is
actually to the left, and the informant is

19
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:52,863
actually from Stanford, then we want a
question that has value true. If the

20
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:57,138
stadium is not to the left, and the informant is from Stanford, then we want a

21
00:01:57,138 --> 00:02:02,059
question with truth value false. So it
stands that if a person's going to tell

22
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:08,715
the truth the value should be the same as
the values in our response. The opposite

23
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:11,625
is true for the Berkley case, cases, if
the stadium is to the left and the

24
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:16,043
informant is from Berkley, we want a
question the has truth value of false

25
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:20,522
since the informant were lying. If the
stadium is not to the left and the

26
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:26,726
informant is from Berkeley then we want a
question that has truth value true. Now looking

27
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:31,517
at our operator semantics tables, we see
that this is exactly the set of true

28
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:38,210
values assigned to the sentence left, if
and only if SU, Stanford. So we can phrase

29
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,143
this as a question as follows. Is it the
case that the left road is the way to the

30
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:49,885
stadium if and only if you are from
Stanford. Okay, that's not a particularly

31
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:54,690
clever or simple question, but it will
ellicit the right response. Importantly

32
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,478
the example illustrates that it's possible
to solve problems of this sort using just

33
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,500
the concepts we have seen so far.
