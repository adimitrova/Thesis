finally an exercise in using 
concepts introduced in this section, 
lets consider following problem 
stanford people always tell truth berkeley people always lie 
unfortunately, looking a person you cannot tell whether is stanford berkeley 
you come to a fork in road want to get to football stadium one fork, you know road to take 
there is a person standing there 
single question you ask to help 
you decide fork to take there a 
number ways to approach this problem 
interesting involves a question in 
a person is asked we would 
answer if you stanford if you 
berkley however, we also 
approach this problem without entertaining 
metalevel questions lets draw 
a table set possible 
states affairs, leave columns 
question we want to ask 
response we want to receive we want to ask a 
question that will list one response 
lets say true one, if stadium is 
to left, a different response, 
example, false zero, if stadium is 
to right note that response 
in case may differ actual 
truth question depending whether 
informant is stanford 
berkley now, lets see actual 
truth value question must to 
elicited this response if stadium is 
actually to left, informant is 
actually stanford, we want a 
question that value true if 
stadium is to left, informant is stanford, we want a 
question truth value false so 
stands that if a persons going to tell 
truth value 
values in response opposite 
is true berkley case, cases, if 
stadium is to left 
informant is berkley, we want a 
question truth value false 
since informant lying if 
stadium is to left 
informant is berkeley we want a 
question that truth value true looking 
operator semantics tables, we see 
that this is exactly set true 
values assigned to sentence left, if 
if su, stanford so we phrase 
this a question follows is 
case that left road is way to 
stadium if if you 
stanford okay, thats a particularly 
clever simple question, will 
ellicit right response importantly 
example illustrates that possible 
to solve problems this sort using 
concepts we seen so far
