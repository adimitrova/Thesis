00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,430
Hello, welcome back.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,480
In this lesson,
we will talk about the parameters and

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,242
use cases that will effect your selection
of an appropriate connectivity solution.

5
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:22,010
We will first define the criteria and
then classify the protocols based on that.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,360
The very first thing you need to
do is define your project's need.

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,430
Defining your need helps you in
selecting a protocol that offers

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,110
the right amount of compromise
between you desired criteria.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,717
Some of these have been discussed
in detail in another video.

10
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,770
Let's look at some of the basic ones here.

11
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:54,630
Range defines the physical distance at
which a protocol can offer connectivity.

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,770
If you want to build a citywide network,

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,640
you need a solution that
has the longest range.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,663
If you want a room base network, you need
a solution that offers a shorter range.

15
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:13,470
Longer range generally comes at the cost
of power consumption and data rate.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,250
This is not always the case, however.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,195
There certain exceptions,
as we will see later.

18
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:25,591
If a protocol supports mesh networking,
you can create a long range

19
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,523
network even if the range of
each individual device is short.

20
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,805
Data rate is the amount of data,

21
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,322
the protocol will allow you
to transfer in one second.

22
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:45,402
Generally, you want to choose
a protocol that offers data rate close

23
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:50,236
to your needs as higher data rates
means more power consumption.

24
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:56,970
How much power does your protocol consume?

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,860
If your device is battery powered,

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,110
you would want to choose the protocol
that has the lowest power consumption.

27
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,041
If your device is directly
connected to the power grid,

28
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,332
this might not be an issue at all.

29
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:17,125
Remote devices are generally
battery powered and

30
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:21,644
require a solution that has
the lowest power consumption.

31
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:29,781
Cost in terms of dollars
defines how much the addition

32
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,300
of a certain module will cost.

33
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:40,191
Complexity is defined
here in terms of time and

34
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:46,050
resources that are required to make
the protocol functional in your design.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,280
Base on the criteria we defined,
let's classify the connectivity protocols.

36
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,800
GSM or cellular technologies
offer the longest ranges for

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,680
point to point communications
after several kilometers.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,170
They also offer very high data rates
starting from a few kilobytes per second,

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,957
like Edge, enhanced data rates for

40
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:16,390
GSM evolution to several megabytes
per second, for example, 4G LTE.

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,679
This, of course, comes at a cost of higher
price, complexity and power consumption.

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,443
There are however, other technologies
that offer long range are cheaper and

43
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:35,655
very low power, but
also have a very low data rates.

44
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:42,179
They are categorized as LPWANs
orLow-Power Wide-Area Networks.

45
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:49,603
Example of these are LoRa, Long Range
Wireless Data Telemetry and SigFox.

46
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:53,144
On the other hand,

47
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:58,680
we have short range technologies that
offer both high and low data rates.

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,530
The difference between them is again,
power consumption and cost.

49
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,338
Low data rate technologies
consume significantly less power.

50
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:12,277
For example, Bluetooth,
low energy and NFC or

51
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:18,298
near-field communication and
are cheaper and less complex to deploy.

52
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,408
High data rate ones like Wi-Fi and

53
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:27,074
Ethernet are complex and
power inefficient.

54
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:35,290
The three very high data rate
technologies that we have

55
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,690
are cellular, Wi-Fi and Ethernet.

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,106
All of them offers speeds of
several megabytes per second.

57
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:48,180
Ethernets is fixed or
wired while the other two are wireless.

58
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:54,841
Medium bandwidth technologies are Zigby,

59
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,893
Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy or BLE.

60
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:02,674
These have a short range,
but a good battery life.

61
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:09,937
There are some technologies that
you would use only for sensing or

62
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:13,833
tagging as they offer short range,
low data rates.

63
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:18,777
And generally,
very low storage capacity on each node,

64
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,580
just enough to identify the item.

65
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,181
For example, we could store the device ID,
web link or a few bytes of text.

66
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:33,144
NFC and RFID are in this category.

67
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:40,497
Power consumption is a very
important factor in deciding

68
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,409
a connectivity solution.

69
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:49,187
Most of the cyber-physical
systems comprise devices or

70
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:55,152
nodes that are links wirelessly and
may not have direct access to power like,

71
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:59,140
for example, remotes sensing solutions.

72
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,780
In such a case, choosing the most
power efficient solution is suggested.

73
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,550
This comes at the disadvantage
of lower data rates.

74
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,881
Here on the screen,
we have divided the technologies into two

75
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:18,821
categories where the differentiating
factor is range.

76
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:22,938
Power consumption and
data rates vary, but not that much.

77
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:28,185
Compared to Wi-Fi and Ethernet,
protocols like NFC, LoRa and

78
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,762
Bluetooth have significant
lower power consumption.

79
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,918
Cost per dollar is a factor,
if you are going to mass deploy

80
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,407
a large set of devices or
if you aim at commercial production.

81
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:50,315
As we discussed earlier,
you have to define your need first.

82
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:54,930
That is what you essentially
require from your system.

83
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,610
This requirement analysis will also
facilitate determining the cost.

84
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,292
If your need is only a sensing solution,
you can go with LoRa or ZigBee.

85
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,030
If it's identification only,
you can use NFC, which is even cheaper.

86
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,214
If your systems require high data rates
and are stationary, use Ethernet.

87
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:22,646
The cost will depend on
the needs of the system.

88
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:29,560
Here we have an example case,
please read it through.

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,627
What would your solution be?

90
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:40,946
There is actually no unique solution,
because you could, in a way or

91
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:45,868
another utilize any of these
technologies to accomplish the task, but

92
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:48,920
we will look for
the most optimal solution.

93
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,443
First, we have to identify your needs.

94
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,684
In this case, you have three.

95
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:58,150
The range is one kilometer.

96
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,190
Update frequencies once per hour and
it's only about weather.

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,502
So, the date is already
actually very low and

98
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,563
you want to see the updates on your phone.

99
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:14,766
Taking these into account, we can see that

100
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:19,918
Bluetooth offers the data rate,
but not the range.

101
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,364
Wi-Fi doesn't offer the range either,

102
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:28,200
although it offers internet
connectivity and ubiquity.

103
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,710
ZigBee offers the range and
the required data rate and

104
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,050
power efficiency as an added bonus, but

105
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,970
there is a higher probability that it
will not be supported by your phone and

106
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,260
you will need a gateway to connect
it to the internet, for example.

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,910
This will increase cost and complexity.

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,520
GSM or
cellular technology offers the range,

109
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,280
data rate and
the ability to be on the same network.

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,950
As a once an hour update schedule,

111
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,535
it can get the weather as a text message
from the weather station to your phone.

112
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:13,754
So, this solution fulfills your
needs in the least complex way.

113
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:17,160
And therefore,
it is the best one for this case.

114
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,776
In this lesson, we learned how to choose
the right connectivity solution for

115
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,311
a cyber-physical system.

116
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:25,538
In the next video,

117
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:30,076
we will learn about choosing
the right M2M communication protocol.
