hello, welcome back 
in this lesson, 
we will talk parameters 
use cases that will effect selection 
an appropriate connectivity solution 
we will first define criteria 
classify protocols based that 
first thing you need to 
is define projects need 
defining need helps you in 
selecting a protocol that offers 
right amount compromise 
between you desired criteria 
discussed 
in detail in another video 
lets look basic ones here 
range defines physical distance 
a protocol offer connectivity 
if you want to build a citywide network, 
you need a solution that 
longest range 
if you want a room base network, you need 
a solution that offers a shorter range 
longer range generally comes cost 
power consumption data rate 
this is always case, however 
there certain exceptions, 
we will see later 
if a protocol supports mesh networking, 
you create a long range 
network even if range 
individual device is short 
data rate is amount data, 
protocol will allow you 
to transfer in one second 
generally, you want to choose 
a protocol that offers data rate close 
to needs higher data rates 
means power consumption 
much power protocol consume 
if device is battery powered, 
you would want to choose protocol 
that lowest power consumption 
if device is directly 
connected to power grid, 
this might an issue 
remote devices generally 
battery powered 
require a solution that 
lowest power consumption 
cost in terms dollars 
defines much addition 
a certain module will cost 
complexity is defined 
here in terms time 
resources that required to make 
protocol functional in design 
base criteria we defined, 
lets classify connectivity protocols 
gsm cellular technologies 
offer longest ranges 
point to point communications 
several kilometers 
also offer high data rates 
starting a few kilobytes per second, 
like edge, enhanced data rates 
gsm evolution to several megabytes 
per second, example, g lte 
this, course, comes a cost higher 
price, complexity power consumption 
there however, technologies 
that offer long range cheaper 
low power, 
also a low data rates 
categorized lpwans 
orlowpower widearea networks 
example lora, long range 
wireless data telemetry sigfox 
hand, 
we short range technologies that 
offer high low data rates 
difference between is again, 
power consumption cost 
low data rate technologies 
consume significantly less power 
example, bluetooth, 
low energy nfc 
nearfield communication 
cheaper less complex to deploy 
high data rate ones like wifi 
ethernet complex 
power inefficient 
three high data rate 
technologies that we 
cellular, wifi ethernet 
offers speeds 
several megabytes per second 
ethernets is fixed 
wired while two wireless 
medium bandwidth technologies zigby, 
bluetooth bluetooth low energy ble 
a short range, 
a good battery life 
there technologies that 
you would use sensing 
tagging offer short range, 
low data rates 
generally, 
low storage capacity node, 
enough to identify item 
example, we could store device id, 
web link a few bytes text 
nfc rfid in this category 
power consumption is a 
important factor in deciding 
a connectivity solution 
cyberphysical 
systems comprise devices 
nodes that links wirelessly 
may direct access to power like, 
example, remotes sensing solutions 
in a case, choosing 
power efficient solution is suggested 
this comes disadvantage 
lower data rates 
here screen, 
we divided technologies two 
categories differentiating 
factor is range 
power consumption 
data rates vary, that much 
compared to wifi ethernet, 
protocols like nfc, lora 
bluetooth significant 
lower power consumption 
cost per dollar is a factor, 
if you going to mass deploy 
a large set devices 
if you aim commercial production 
we discussed earlier, 
you to define need first 
that is you essentially 
require system 
this requirement analysis will also 
facilitate determining cost 
if need is a sensing solution, 
you go lora zigbee 
if identification only, 
you use nfc, is even cheaper 
if systems require high data rates 
stationary, use ethernet 
cost will depend 
needs system 
here we an example case, 
please read 
would solution 
there is actually unique solution, 
you could, in a way 
another utilize 
technologies to accomplish task, 
we will look 
optimal solution 
first, we to identify needs 
in this case, you three 
range is one kilometer 
update frequencies per hour 
weather 
so, date is already 
actually low 
you want to see updates phone 
taking account, we see that 
bluetooth offers data rate, 
range 
wifi doesnt offer range either, 
although offers internet 
connectivity ubiquity 
zigbee offers range 
required data rate 
power efficiency an added bonus, 
there is a higher probability that 
will supported phone 
you will need a gateway to connect 
to internet, example 
this will increase cost complexity 
gsm 
cellular technology offers range, 
data rate 
ability to network 
a an hour update schedule, 
get weather a text message 
weather station to phone 
so, this solution fulfills 
needs in least complex way 
therefore, 
is best one this case 
in this lesson, we learned to choose 
right connectivity solution 
a cyberphysical system 
in next video, 
we will learn choosing 
right mm communication protocol
