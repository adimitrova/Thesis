hello
,
welcome
back
.
in
this
lesson
,
we
will
talk
about
the
parameters
and
use
cases
that
will
effect
your
selection
of
an
appropriate
connectivity
solution
.
we
will
first
define
the
criteria
and
then
classify
the
protocols
based
on
that
.
the
very
first
thing
you
need
to
do
is
define
your
project
's
need
.
defining
your
need
helps
you
in
selecting
a
protocol
that
offers
the
right
amount
of
compromise
between
you
desired
criteria
.
some
of
these
have
been
discussed
in
detail
in
another
video
.
let
's
look
at
some
of
the
basic
ones
here
.
range
defines
the
physical
distance
at
which
a
protocol
can
offer
connectivity
.
if
you
want
to
build
a
citywide
network
,
you
need
a
solution
that
has
the
longest
range
.
if
you
want
a
room
base
network
,
you
need
a
solution
that
offers
a
shorter
range
.
longer
range
generally
comes
at
the
cost
of
power
consumption
and
data
rate
.
this
is
not
always
the
case
,
however
.
there
certain
exceptions
,
as
we
will
see
later
.
if
a
protocol
supports
mesh
networking
,
you
can
create
a
long
range
network
even
if
the
range
of
each
individual
device
is
short
.
data
rate
is
the
amount
of
data
,
the
protocol
will
allow
you
to
transfer
in
one
second
.
generally
,
you
want
to
choose
a
protocol
that
offers
data
rate
close
to
your
needs
as
higher
data
rates
means
more
power
consumption
.
how
much
power
does
your
protocol
consume
?
if
your
device
is
battery
powered
,
you
would
want
to
choose
the
protocol
that
has
the
lowest
power
consumption
.
if
your
device
is
directly
connected
to
the
power
grid
,
this
might
not
be
an
issue
at
all
.
remote
devices
are
generally
battery
powered
and
require
a
solution
that
has
the
lowest
power
consumption
.
cost
in
terms
of
dollars
defines
how
much
the
addition
of
a
certain
module
will
cost
.
complexity
is
defined
here
in
terms
of
time
and
resources
that
are
required
to
make
the
protocol
functional
in
your
design
.
base
on
the
criteria
we
defined
,
let
's
classify
the
connectivity
protocols
.
gsm
or
cellular
technologies
offer
the
longest
ranges
for
point
to
point
communications
after
several
kilometers
.
they
also
offer
very
high
data
rates
starting
from
a
few
kilobytes
per
second
,
like
edge
,
enhanced
data
rates
for
gsm
evolution
to
several
megabytes
per
second
,
for
example
,
4g
lte
.
this
,
of
course
,
comes
at
a
cost
of
higher
price
,
complexity
and
power
consumption
.
there
are
however
,
other
technologies
that
offer
long
range
are
cheaper
and
very
low
power
,
but
also
have
a
very
low
data
rates
.
they
are
categorized
as
lpwans
orlow-power
wide-area
networks
.
example
of
these
are
lora
,
long
range
wireless
data
telemetry
and
sigfox
.
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
short
range
technologies
that
offer
both
high
and
low
data
rates
.
the
difference
between
them
is
again
,
power
consumption
and
cost
.
low
data
rate
technologies
consume
significantly
less
power
.
for
example
,
bluetooth
,
low
energy
and
nfc
or
near-field
communication
and
are
cheaper
and
less
complex
to
deploy
.
high
data
rate
ones
like
wi-fi
and
ethernet
are
complex
and
power
inefficient
.
the
three
very
high
data
rate
technologies
that
we
have
are
cellular
,
wi-fi
and
ethernet
.
all
of
them
offers
speeds
of
several
megabytes
per
second
.
ethernets
is
fixed
or
wired
while
the
other
two
are
wireless
.
medium
bandwidth
technologies
are
zigby
,
bluetooth
and
bluetooth
low
energy
or
ble
.
these
have
a
short
range
,
but
a
good
battery
life
.
there
are
some
technologies
that
you
would
use
only
for
sensing
or
tagging
as
they
offer
short
range
,
low
data
rates
.
and
generally
,
very
low
storage
capacity
on
each
node
,
just
enough
to
identify
the
item
.
for
example
,
we
could
store
the
device
id
,
web
link
or
a
few
bytes
of
text
.
nfc
and
rfid
are
in
this
category
.
power
consumption
is
a
very
important
factor
in
deciding
a
connectivity
solution
.
most
of
the
cyber-physical
systems
comprise
devices
or
nodes
that
are
links
wirelessly
and
may
not
have
direct
access
to
power
like
,
for
example
,
remotes
sensing
solutions
.
in
such
a
case
,
choosing
the
most
power
efficient
solution
is
suggested
.
this
comes
at
the
disadvantage
of
lower
data
rates
.
here
on
the
screen
,
we
have
divided
the
technologies
into
two
categories
where
the
differentiating
factor
is
range
.
power
consumption
and
data
rates
vary
,
but
not
that
much
.
compared
to
wi-fi
and
ethernet
,
protocols
like
nfc
,
lora
and
bluetooth
have
significant
lower
power
consumption
.
cost
per
dollar
is
a
factor
,
if
you
are
going
to
mass
deploy
a
large
set
of
devices
or
if
you
aim
at
commercial
production
.
as
we
discussed
earlier
,
you
have
to
define
your
need
first
.
that
is
what
you
essentially
require
from
your
system
.
this
requirement
analysis
will
also
facilitate
determining
the
cost
.
if
your
need
is
only
a
sensing
solution
,
you
can
go
with
lora
or
zigbee
.
if
it
's
identification
only
,
you
can
use
nfc
,
which
is
even
cheaper
.
if
your
systems
require
high
data
rates
and
are
stationary
,
use
ethernet
.
the
cost
will
depend
on
the
needs
of
the
system
.
here
we
have
an
example
case
,
please
read
it
through
.
what
would
your
solution
be
?
there
is
actually
no
unique
solution
,
because
you
could
,
in
a
way
or
another
utilize
any
of
these
technologies
to
accomplish
the
task
,
but
we
will
look
for
the
most
optimal
solution
.
first
,
we
have
to
identify
your
needs
.
in
this
case
,
you
have
three
.
the
range
is
one
kilometer
.
update
frequencies
once
per
hour
and
it
's
only
about
weather
.
so
,
the
date
is
already
actually
very
low
and
you
want
to
see
the
updates
on
your
phone
.
taking
these
into
account
,
we
can
see
that
bluetooth
offers
the
data
rate
,
but
not
the
range
.
wi-fi
does
n't
offer
the
range
either
,
although
it
offers
internet
connectivity
and
ubiquity
.
zigbee
offers
the
range
and
the
required
data
rate
and
power
efficiency
as
an
added
bonus
,
but
there
is
a
higher
probability
that
it
will
not
be
supported
by
your
phone
and
you
will
need
a
gateway
to
connect
it
to
the
internet
,
for
example
.
this
will
increase
cost
and
complexity
.
gsm
or
cellular
technology
offers
the
range
,
data
rate
and
the
ability
to
be
on
the
same
network
.
as
a
once
an
hour
update
schedule
,
it
can
get
the
weather
as
a
text
message
from
the
weather
station
to
your
phone
.
so
,
this
solution
fulfills
your
needs
in
the
least
complex
way
.
and
therefore
,
it
is
the
best
one
for
this
case
.
in
this
lesson
,
we
learned
how
to
choose
the
right
connectivity
solution
for
a
cyber-physical
system
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
learn
about
choosing
the
right
m2m
communication
protocol
.
