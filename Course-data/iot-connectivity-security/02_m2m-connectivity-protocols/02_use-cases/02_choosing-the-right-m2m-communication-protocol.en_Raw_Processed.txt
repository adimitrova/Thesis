hello, welcome back 
in earlier video lectures, 
we discussed key properties 
application layer mm 
communication protocols 
in this lessons, we will look set 
popular communication protocols 
goal to give guidelines to 
select right protocol system 
one thing that always 
needs to considered 
is that selection between 
protocols is a matter compromise 
rare to find a situation 
a protocol fits perfectly 
checking check marks 
in light this is always 
a good idea to divide criteria 
least two categories 
absolutely necessary 
must features 
optional good to features 
absolutely, necessary 
will features that 
critical to project 
operations performed 
good to features would 
that facilitate operations 
in this video lecture, 
we will describe 
provide criteria 
use cases considered protocols 
criteria deployment scenario 
deployment scenario is one 
important factors to look 
in kind scenario 
will a protocol deployed 
would a realtime system, 
telemetry, security, messaging 
kind connection will provided 
is a low power lossy network 
a high throughput always setup 
cases require different 
features communication protocol 
security 
you need to determine 
kind security you need 
look whether is provided 
candidate protocols 
current emergence malware 
data breaches, 
important to project 
data rest, also data in motion 
this means data that would 
carried protocol 
communication paradigm 
if link layer connectivity 
product goal is meshbased 
meaning, there is primary gateway 
broker 
make sense to use an application layer, 
communication protocol 
that feature 
a protocol offers direct 
client to client communication 
without a central server 
contrary, if you need to 
aggregate data multiple sensors, 
better to use a protocol that 
a broker central server 
in this case, there is default, 
one data point, 
broker information 
collected processed 
payload format 
cyberphysical system 
rarely works 
generally, is part a larger system, 
a control monitoring system 
in this case, design time 
complexity reduced 
using a protocol that supports payload 
format rest system 
web connected system 
utilize communication 
protocols that support web 
related formats, hdml, 
xml, even json 
javascript object notation 
strictly, machine to machine 
systems utilize protocols 
that provide support json 
compatibility existing installation 
is important to know kind 
protocols systems in use 
moment in environment in 
system will installed 
this primary guideline 
decision unless there severe 
limitations in current systems that 
going to fixed new one 
quality service 
critical systems require 
strong quality service 
protocols offer builtin 
quality service features 
protocols not, rely 
low layer protocols to provide 
communication performance 
speed, throughput, cashing, complexity 
quality service 
factors performance 
fast connections established 
much throughput 
protocol provide 
a cashing resending 
is communication complexity 
is quality service handled 
provide a measure 
communication performance protocol 
first protocol to address is http 
http offers nonoptimal performance, 
designed 
always always reliable 
connectivity platforms 
however, offers highest level 
flexibility ease integration 
current future cloud systems 
without gateways translations 
also offers comprehensive 
support different payload formats 
moreover, newer standard 
https offers solid security features 
downside http low performance 
high energy consumption 
also, is a connection list protocol 
so new connections to established, 
frequently 
consider coap, 
constrained application protocol to 
a cyberphysical systems 
internet things version http 
offers http 
plus is lightweight, 
basic quality service features 
higher performance in terms 
processing power memory consumption 
coap designed in 
a way that is easy 
to build a gateway between http coap 
therefore, coap used, 
rather seamlessly in webbased scenarios 
mqtt message queuing telemetry 
transport protocol is good telemetry 
applications, course, 
originally designed this purpose 
main issue mqtt is security 
doesnt provide security 
features although used 
lowerlevel security solutions, 
tls, transport layer security 
mqtt is lightweight 
doesnt offer specific 
payload format support 
transmits everything bias 
this makes integration 
current systems, rather difficult 
quality 
service features, 
handle unreliable connections 
well considered 
applications remote operations 
messaging plays key role 
xmpp extensible messaging 
presence protocol is messaging, 
security 
if devices notes require 
messaging between 
this messaging done securely, 
xmpp used protocol choice 
xmpp supports one to one 
group oriented messaging 
security alarm systems use xmpp 
to alert users smartphones 
modern operating 
systems form 
xmpp implementation already builtin 
cities use xmpp to alert users 
traffic changes due to 
construction work 
natural disasters, example 
xmpp suitable to mashing 
to mashing messaging 
relaying that information 
to humans controllers 
downside, is heavy 
realtime 
dds data distribution service protocol 
is reliability performance 
a comprehensive support 
quality service 
message will get delivered to 
recipient even if broker, 
recipient is 
connected to goes offline 
this reliability feature 
is one key reasons 
dds is preferred in 
military applications 
also a strong focus security 
scalable easily 
accommodate growing number nodes 
in this module previous one, we 
discussed different communication 
connectivity protocols underlying 
architecture web protocols 
in next module, 
we will move onto building web 
connectivity embedded systems
