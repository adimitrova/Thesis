sound hello, welcome back to 
course web connectivity 
security in cyberphysical systems 
this lesson starts a module link 
layer connectivity protocols 
application layer communication protocols 
in this video lecture, well talk 
connectivity solutions available 
embedded systems 
in words, 
we will focus machine to machine 
mm connectivity protocols 
basic characteristics 
machine to machine connectivity 
protocols facilitate establishment 
a connection between two 
devices 
here we will discussing protocols 
that reside link layer tcp, 
ip model 
establish a path 
between two end points 
cyberphysical system case, 
connectivity solutions 
broadly divided two main 
categories, wired wireless 
wired connection ones that 
require a physical connection between 
endpoints 
while in wireless connections, 
we dont physical medium 
we will see this classification 
affects abilities 
protocols in many ways 
example range, date rate, 
power consumption 
wired connections generally tend 
to higher date rates 
higher power consumption 
this is always case 
there certain parameters 
that help us defining 
distinguishing connectivity protocols 
mainly range, data rate, 
power consumption, topology, 
tcpip support, spectrum, 
estimated node support, approximate cost 
well, will 
discussed in this lecture 
range defines far away 
to distance protocol 
offer connectivity 
based this definition range, 
we divide protocols broadly 
four logical categories, 
pan, lan, man, wan 
pan personal area network 
interconnects devices 
within personal 
space an individual 
range is typically 
ten centimeters to ten meters 
lan local area network 
interconnects devices within a limited 
area a home, office, building 
ranges typically ten 
meters to hundreds meters 
man a metropolitan area network 
interconnects devices within a city 
district covering several buildings, 
a large 
university network a citywide 
municipal network good examples 
range is typically 
meters to tens kilometers 
wan, wide area network, 
generally geographical 
restrictions location size 
wan enables different lans 
to connect to 
although distance 
is a limit such, 
a wan restricted to 
a specific country example 
data rate defines much 
data per second you transfer 
much data protocol 
theoretically transfer per second 
in wireless networks, 
theoretical maximum is generally 
quite different actual results 
cyberphysical systems, 
we divide data rates low, 
high high categories 
low data rates transfer 
to one megabits per second 
high data rates one 
to two megabits per second 
high data rates 
megabits per second 
this classification doesnt apply 
thinking in terms typical 
human usage networks 
remember that two megabits per second 
sustained throughput is pretty high 
embedded systems, 
smart energy meter 
smart lighting system, like philips hue, 
doesnt watch netflix 
data transfers typically periodic 
updates require high 
data rates 
power consumptions gives you 
an idea battery life 
a data throughput 
interconnection protocol 
generally, lower power 
consumption, lower data rate 
higher rates mean device is 
longer periods time 
to process faster, 
thereby increasing power consumption 
here we divide power consumption 
two categories, idle active 
idle power consumption is power used 
devices is in state rest 
meaning, communication is taking place 
idle power is a significant factor, 
example, in sensor networks 
sensors mostly 
idle communication wise 
active power consumption 
is power used 
a device is in full 
communication mode 
this will give you 
battery life node 
node is 
full communication load 
another consideration is whether 
connectivity protocol 
modules offer different power profiles 
idle state enabling profile, 
low data rate profile, 
receive profile, 
transmit profile 
save battery 
power in way 
topology refers to interconnection 
between different nodes in network 
there different ways a protocol might 
allow devices to connect to 
common 
dominant ones following 
in a bus topology theres 
a central line bus 
device is connected to that line 
so logically device is directly 
connected to devices 
in a star topology we 
a central node server 
device connects to this server 
in a mesh topology, 
device is connected 
via point to point links to two 
devices 
in a full mesh topology, 
device is connected to 
devices in network 
a tree topology is a mixture 
star bus topologies 
in a tree network, two star 
networks connected a bus network 
an important question is, 
connectivity protocol 
support tcpip higher layers 
this is essential in two main ways 
first, supporting tcpip 
means easy aggressing 
connectivity to existing internet 
legacy systems that already deployed 
second, makes web 
connectivity easy 
in case there is support internet 
connectivity, a gateway used 
example, a large set smart 
tags connect to a central server, 
is connected to internet 
in this case, central server is 
gateway to internet tags 
gateways benefits 
drawbacks 
example, 
add extra cost complexity 
hand, 
used to offer extended functions 
a gateway could, example, 
encrypt data coming tags 
passing this data to internet 
manage authentication 
limited access to tag 
so 
gateway essentially extends 
complements services provided 
connectivity protocols 
is important to know part 
microwave spectrum a wireless 
connectivity protocol uses 
there might regional restrictions 
spectrum is used device 
a device might operating 
in a commercial band 
requiring you to get a license to operate 
there different bands 
simplicity we divide 
two categories, free commercial 
free band is portion 
wireless spectrum 
that doesnt require devices 
to operating licenses 
common one is industry 
scientific medical ism band 
frequency ranges vast 
an example bluetooth 
wifi operate in two point 
four gigahertz ism band 
an example commercial band is 
, megahertz range used gsm 
estimated node support 
is simple to understand 
means number clients that 
connected to other, 
either directly via gateway 
there might theoretical limit 
many devices connected 
there comes a point 
performance get severely degraded 
a lot nodes connect 
to a single gateway, 
example in case a wifi 
last parameter is cost 
deploying a small set devices 
a difference euros per 
device might matter much 
deploying hundreds 
thousands nodes 
even a few cents affect 
overall price greatly 
in cyberphysical systems 
censor networks, number 
nodes is often large enough to make 
price a decisive factor in 
selecting connectivity protocol 
in this lecture, we defined basic 
properties connectivity protocols 
in next video, 
we will an overview a set 
popular connectivity protocols
