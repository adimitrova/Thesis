hello, welcome to another lesson 
connectivity protocols 
in an earlier video lecture, 
we talked different 
properties connectivity protocols 
in this lesson, we will use 
properties to describe 
differentiate common 
important connectivity protocols 
first, wired protocol 
we will discuss here, is ethernet 
ieee working group defines 
specification ethernet 
megabyte gigabyte ethernet 
commonly found in different 
embedded development boards 
specifications data rates 
to gbps coaxial cable 
gbps fiber optic 
cable proposed 
ethernet designed in a time power 
consumption a consideration 
therefore, 
modules consume a lot power 
compared to 
standards discussed here 
cheap enough is even available 
part low cost embedded 
development boards 
defined umbrella ieee, 
wifi offers a wireless local 
area network specification 
that a standard range 
meters data rate gbps 
data rate varies 
mbps to greater gbps, 
depending spectrum 
technology used 
power consumption varies 
based module 
manufacturer, 
a power friendly standard 
number devices connected to 
a single gateway depends available 
bandwidth, will divided 
between connected clients 
processing power 
memory system 
in simple home devices, 
there to connections 
wifi mainly operates in 
gigahertz ism band, 
although gigahertz 
newer gigahertz standards 
proposed 
a newer standard, 
proposed in megahertz band 
will offer better range 
power consumption 
downside lower bandwidth, 
this standard is targeted 
internet things 
bluetooth is a standard managed 
bluetooth special interest group 
a shortrange, low bandwidth 
personal area network protocol 
operates in unlicensed 
gigahertz ism band 
uses frequency hopping spread spectrum 
older bluetooth standards offered 
to mbitss data rates, 
while newer bluetooth 
offers to mbitss 
bluetooth smart, bluetooth low energy, 
ble is designed 
low power consumption 
despite similar name 
to classic bluetooth, 
a completely different 
standard together 
unlike classic bluetooth, 
ble data rate mbitss 
designed 
sending periodic chunks data, 
therefore is suitable 
voice calls music streaming 
ble offers to bit aes 
encryption messages 
here aes stands 
advance encryption standard 
an approximate transmission 
power milliwatts, 
milliseconds per transaction, 
a ble device perform 
million transactions 
within a small coin cell battery 
moreover, unlike in classic bluetooth, 
there is theoretical 
limits many nodes 
connect to one access point 
mesh networking is supported, 
is considered to 
made part standard 
zigbee is a standard 
low power mesh networking nodes 
although range is to a meters, 
due to mesh nature, offer 
connectivity longer distances 
physical link layer, 
uses standard 
defined ieee, 
unlike connectivity protocols, 
also defines network 
application layer protocol 
this is part 
zigbee protocol stack 
simple way to understand this is that 
in zigbee standard connectivity 
radio part is handled via 
ieee specifications, 
remaining logical 
parts like routing, security, 
data payload formats profiling 
done zigbee alliance 
this reason, zigbee is 
a connectivity protocol, 
also a communication protocol 
we will learn 
communication protocols later 
rfid stands 
radio frequency identification 
you think an advanced 
replacement bar codes 
instead a barcode a product, 
theres a tag 
instead light in 
case a barcode reader, 
you use radio waves to 
interact tag 
this means that you 
a longer range, 
tag doesnt to 
visible to read 
implanted anywhere 
in product, 
long in range 
reader, tracked read 
a minimum, tags a chip, 
kilobytes memory, antennae 
memories stores 
information tag 
chip processes this data 
performs transformation functions 
antenna is use to transmit 
receive rf signals 
tags passive active 
passive tags take power rf 
signals transmitted reader 
active tags a battery 
that powers 
thats active tags a higher cost, 
a longer range 
a typical range rfid usage is meter 
cellular technologies is 
a broad term 
encapsulates a wide range technologies 
in simple terms, cellular technologies 
there multiple small 
interconnected transmitters 
cells instead one main transmitter 
another feature is frequency reuse, 
one frequency is used multiple 
cells to increase range capacity 
cells, to geography 
far apart other, so 
that there is minimal to interference 
common cellular 
technology is gsm 
worlds mobile 
network operators use gsm 
gsm also multiple 
standards classified first, 
second, third generation so 
data rates number users per 
cell improves generation 
current deployed generation is fourth, 
g, while g is in development 
every generation, 
you multiple competing standards 
example, g, we two 
main competitors, wimax lte 
a competing standard to gsm is cdma 
used widely, 
mostly limited to united states 
in case, 
choice technology based 
range you need, 
cdma offers a better range, data rate, 
lte offers a better data rate, 
local availability, 
whichever network is deployed 
in area cost 
lowpan stands ipv low power 
wireless personal area networks 
name suggests, 
is a standard that enables use 
ipv low power edge devices 
natively communicating using 
internet protocol, lowpan devices 
networks dont require special 
gateways to connect to ip networks, 
internet 
therefore, lowpan offers 
interoperability 
simplicity in design compared to zigbee 
bluetooth 
essentially, this standard 
enables ipv packets to 
transmitted ieee , 
is a standard low data rate 
wireless personal area networks 
this makes lowpan ideal 
cyber physical systems, 
ip connectivity 
low power consumption essential 
in this lesson, we discuss basics 
important m to 
m connectivity protocols protocols 
that mainly reside link layer 
in later videos, 
we will look communication protocols 
that reside application layer 
sound
