00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,123
[SOUND] Hello, welcome back to
the course on web connectivity and

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:11,601
security in cyber-physical systems.

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,547
This lesson starts a module on link
layer connectivity protocols and

4
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:18,280
application layer communication protocols.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,780
In this video lecture, we'll talk about
connectivity solutions available for

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,570
embedded systems.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,060
In other words,
we will focus on machine to machine or

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,020
M2M connectivity protocols and
their basic characteristics.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,730
Machine to machine connectivity
protocols facilitate the establishment

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,370
of a connection between two or
more devices.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,569
Here we will be discussing the protocols
that reside on the link layer of the TCP,

12
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,471
IP model.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,180
They establish a path
between two end points.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,102
For our cyber-physical system case,
the connectivity solutions can

15
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:03,500
broadly be divided into two main
categories, wired and wireless.

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,547
Wired connection are the one's that
require a physical connection between

17
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:10,980
endpoints.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,560
While in wireless connections,
we don't have any physical medium.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,930
As we will see this classification
affects the abilities

20
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,440
of the protocols in many ways.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,140
For example range, date rate,
and power consumption.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,400
Wired connections generally tend
to have higher date rates and

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,780
higher power consumption but
this is not always the case.

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,110
There are certain parameters
that help us defining and

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,205
distinguishing connectivity protocols.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,708
Mainly range, data rate,
power consumption, topology,

27
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,270
TCP/IP support, spectrum,

28
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,910
estimated node support, approximate cost.

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,360
Well, each of these will be
discussed in this lecture.

30
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,300
The range defines how far away or

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,530
to what distance the protocol
can offer connectivity.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,890
Based on this definition of range,
we divide the protocols broadly into

33
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,900
four logical categories,
PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN.

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,370
PAN or personal area network
interconnects devices

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,620
within the personal
space of an individual.

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,430
The range is typically from
ten centimeters to ten meters.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,930
LAN or local area network
interconnects devices within a limited

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,710
area such as a home, office, or building.

39
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,750
It ranges typically from ten
meters to some hundreds of meters.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,460
MAN or a metropolitan area network
interconnects devices within a city or

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,240
district covering several buildings,
a large

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,370
university network and a citywide
municipal network are good examples.

43
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,800
The range is typically from 500
meters to some tens of kilometers.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,300
WAN, or wide area network,

45
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,740
generally has no geographical
restrictions on its location or size.

46
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,040
The WAN enables different LANs
to connect to each other.

47
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,468
Although the distance
is not a limit as such,

48
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:32,628
a WAN can be restricted to
a specific country for example.

49
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,650
The data rate defines how much
data per second you can transfer.

50
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,260
Or how much data the protocol can
theoretically transfer per second.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,370
In wireless networks,

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,402
the theoretical maximum is generally
quite different from actual results.

53
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,760
For cyber-physical systems,

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,490
we divide the data rates into low,
high and very high categories.

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,210
Low data rates transfer up
to one megabits per second.

56
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,844
High data rates more than one
to two megabits per second.

57
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:16,135
And very high data rates more
than 50 megabits per second.

58
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:22,492
This classification doesn't apply
when thinking in terms of typical

59
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:24,300
human usage of networks.

60
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:30,974
Remember that two megabits per second of
sustained throughput is pretty high for

61
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:35,002
most embedded systems,
because your smart energy meter or

62
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:39,770
smart lighting system, like Philips Hue,
doesn't watch Netflix.

63
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,650
Data transfers are typically periodic
updates which do not require high

64
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,537
data rates.

65
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:52,031
Power consumptions gives you
an idea about battery life and

66
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:55,880
a data throughput of your
interconnection protocol.

67
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,610
Generally, the lower the power
consumption, the lower the data rate.

68
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:09,360
Higher rates mean the device is on for
longer periods of time and

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,180
has to process more and faster,
thereby increasing power consumption.

70
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,040
Here we divide power consumption into
two categories, idle and active.

71
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,540
Idle power consumption is the power used
when the devices is in the state of rest.

72
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,440
Meaning, no communication is taking place.

73
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,925
Idle power is a significant factor,
for example, in sensor networks.

74
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:44,610
Where sensors are mostly
idle communication wise.

75
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,970
Active power consumption
is the power used when

76
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,470
a device is in the full
communication mode.

77
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,980
This will give you
the battery life of your node

78
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,185
when the node is under
full communication load.

79
00:05:57,185 --> 00:06:03,340
Another consideration is whether
the connectivity protocol and

80
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,890
modules offer different power profiles.

81
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,680
Such as idle state enabling profile,
low data rate profile,

82
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,410
receive only profile, and
transmit only profile.

83
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,100
Each of these save battery
power in its own way.

84
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,620
The topology refers to the interconnection
between different nodes in the network.

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,360
There are different ways a protocol might
allow devices to connect to each other.

86
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,787
The most common or
dominant ones are the following.

87
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:45,928
In a bus topology there's
a central line or bus and

88
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:49,405
each device is connected to that line.

89
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:55,720
So logically each device is directly
connected to the other devices.

90
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:01,607
In a star topology we have
a central node or server and

91
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,660
each device connects to this server.

92
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,110
In a mesh topology,
each device is connected

93
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,320
via point to point links to two or
more other devices.

94
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,980
In a full mesh topology,

95
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,940
each device is connected to all
other devices in the network.

96
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,698
A tree topology is a mixture of
the star and bus topologies.

97
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:34,630
In a tree network, two or more star
networks are connected by a bus network.

98
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,580
An important question is,

99
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,089
does the connectivity protocol
support TCP/IP on the higher layers?

100
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,810
This is essential in two main ways.

101
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:53,940
First, supporting TCP/IP
means easy aggressing and

102
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,880
connectivity to existing internet or
legacy systems that are already deployed.

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,609
Second, it makes web
connectivity very easy.

104
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,070
In case there is no support for Internet
connectivity, a gateway can be used.

105
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,270
For example, a large set of smart
tags can connect to a central server,

106
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,210
which is connected to the Internet.

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,950
In this case, the central server is the
gateway to the Internet for those tags.

108
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,050
Gateways have their benefits and
drawbacks.

109
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,880
For example,
they add extra cost and complexity.

110
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,070
On the other hand, they can be
used to offer extended functions.

111
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,960
A gateway could, for example,
encrypt data coming from the tags

112
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,680
before passing this data to the Internet.

113
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,335
Or it can manage authentication and
limited access to each tag.

114
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:01,557
By doing so
the gateway essentially extends and

115
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:07,044
complements the services provided by
the connectivity protocols themselves.

116
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,957
It is important to know which part
of the microwave spectrum a wireless

117
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,070
connectivity protocol uses.

118
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,150
There might be regional restrictions on
the spectrum which is used by your device.

119
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,010
Or a device might be operating
in a commercial band

120
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,390
requiring you to get a license to operate.

121
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,420
There are different bands but for

122
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,730
simplicity we can divide them into
two categories, free and commercial.

123
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,620
The free band is the portion
of the wireless spectrum

124
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,230
that doesn't require devices
to have operating licenses.

125
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,520
The most common one is the industry of
scientific and medical or ISM band.

126
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,381
The frequency ranges are vast but
as an example Bluetooth and

127
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:06,082
WiFi operate in the two point
four gigahertz ISM band.

128
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,834
An example of the commercial band is 900
and 1,800 megahertz range used by GSM.

129
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:21,340
Estimated node support
is simple to understand.

130
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,930
It means the number of clients that
can be connected to each other,

131
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,180
either directly or via gateway.

132
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,890
There might no theoretical limit on
how many devices can be connected.

133
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,210
But there comes a point where
the performance get severely degraded

134
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,210
when a lot of nodes are connect
to a single gateway, for

135
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,190
example in the case of a WiFi.

136
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,030
The last parameter is the cost.

137
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,170
When deploying a small set of devices

138
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,960
a difference of some euros per
device might not matter too much.

139
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,600
But when deploying hundreds
of thousands of nodes

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,389
even a few cents can affect
the overall price greatly.

141
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,460
In cyber-physical systems and

142
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,560
censor networks, the number of
nodes is often large enough to make

143
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,580
the price a decisive factor in
selecting the connectivity protocol.

144
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,435
In this lecture, we have defined the basic
properties of connectivity protocols.

145
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,925
In the next video,

146
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:36,340
we will have an overview of a set
of popular connectivity protocols.

147
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,269
