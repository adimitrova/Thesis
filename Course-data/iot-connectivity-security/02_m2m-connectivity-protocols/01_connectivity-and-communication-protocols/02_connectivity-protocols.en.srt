00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,050
Hello, welcome to another lesson
on connectivity protocols.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,520
In an earlier video lecture,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,810
we talked about the different
properties of connectivity protocols.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,176
In this lesson, we will use
those properties to describe and

6
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:24,602
differentiate some of the very common and
important connectivity protocols.

7
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:30,008
The first, and the only wired protocol
we will discuss here, is ethernet.

8
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:38,437
The IEEE 802.3 working group defines
the specification for ethernet.

9
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:41,762
100 megabyte and gigabyte ethernet can

10
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:46,664
be commonly found in different
embedded development boards.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,306
Specifications for data rates up
to 100Gbps over coaxial cable and

12
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:59,300
400Gbps over fiber optic
cable have been proposed.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,760
Ethernet was designed in a time when power
consumption was not a consideration.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,950
And therefore,
the modules consume a lot of power

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,500
compared to the other
standards discussed here.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,562
It's cheap enough and is even available as

17
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:25,224
part of low cost embedded
development boards.

18
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:29,901
Defined under the 802.11 umbrella of IEEE,

19
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:35,341
Wi-Fi offers a wireless local
area network specification

20
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:41,989
that has a standard range of about
100 meters and data rate of 1Gbps.

21
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:49,474
The data rate varies from
50Mbps to greater than 1Gbps,

22
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:55,620
depending on the spectrum and
technology used.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,990
Power consumption varies
based on the module and

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,410
manufacturer, but
it's not a power friendly standard.

25
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,070
The number of devices connected to
a single gateway depends on the available

26
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,550
bandwidth, which will be divided
between the connected clients and

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,910
the processing power and
memory of the system.

28
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:25,274
In simple home devices,
there can be up to 253 connections.

29
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:31,179
WI-FI mainly operates in
the 2.4 gigahertz ISM band,

30
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,831
although 5 gigahertz and

31
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:39,268
newer 60 gigahertz standards
have been proposed.

32
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:44,312
A newer standard, 802.11 Has been

33
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:48,956
proposed in the 900 megahertz band.

34
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:54,020
It will offer better range and
power consumption.

35
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,598
With the downside of lower bandwidth,
this standard is targeted for

36
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,900
the Internet of Things.

37
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:08,725
Bluetooth is a standard managed by
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.

38
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:14,790
It's a short-range, low bandwidth
personal area network protocol.

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,395
It operates in the unlicensed
2.4 gigahertz ISM band and

40
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:26,764
uses frequency hopping spread spectrum.

41
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:33,549
Older Bluetooth standards offered
up to 3Mbits/s data rates,

42
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,603
while newer Bluetooth 4.0
offers up to 34Mbits/s.

43
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:47,147
Bluetooth Smart, or Bluetooth Low Energy,

44
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:51,509
or BLE is designed for
very low power consumption.

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,770
Despite the similar name
to the classic Bluetooth,

46
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,300
it's a completely different
standard all together.

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,490
Unlike the classic Bluetooth,
BLE has the data rate of just 1Mbits/s.

48
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,160
It's designed for
sending periodic chunks of data, and

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,117
therefore it is not suitable for
voice calls or music streaming.

50
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:26,920
BLE offers up to 128 bit AES
encryption for messages.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Here AES stands for
the Advance Encryption Standard.

52
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:38,635
With an approximate transmission
power of 15 milliwatts, and

53
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:43,580
3 milliseconds per transaction,
a BLE device can perform

54
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,440
more than 20 million transactions
within a small coin cell battery.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,580
Moreover, unlike in the classic Bluetooth,
there is no theoretical

56
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,090
limits on how many nodes can
connect to one access point.

57
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,960
Mesh networking is not supported, but

58
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,140
is being considered to be
made part of the standard.

59
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,390
ZigBee is a standard for
low power mesh networking nodes.

60
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,810
Although the range is up to a 100 meters,

61
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,760
due to the mesh nature, it can offer
connectivity over longer distances.

62
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,350
On the physical or link layer,
it uses the 802.15.4 standard

63
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,090
defined by IEEE, and
unlike other connectivity protocols,

64
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,570
it also defines the network and
application layer protocol.

65
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,851
All of this is part of
the ZigBee protocol stack.

66
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:54,143
The simple way to understand this is that
in the ZigBee standard the connectivity or

67
00:05:54,143 --> 00:06:00,084
radio part is handled via
IEEE 802.15.4 specifications,

68
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:05,294
but the remaining logical
parts like routing, security,

69
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:11,989
data payload formats and profiling
are done by the ZigBee alliance itself.

70
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:16,542
For this reason, ZigBee is not
only a connectivity protocol, but

71
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,830
also a communication protocol.

72
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,060
We will learn more about
communication protocols later.

73
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,080
RFID stands for
radio frequency identification.

74
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,819
You can think of it as an advanced
replacement for bar codes.

75
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,800
Instead of a barcode on a product,
there's a tag.

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,980
And instead of light as in
the case of a barcode reader,

77
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,800
you use radio waves to
interact with the tag.

78
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,510
This means that you can
have a longer range, and

79
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,910
the tag doesn't have to
be visible to be read.

80
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,360
It can be implanted anywhere
in the product, and

81
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,220
as long as it's in the range of
the reader, it can be tracked and read.

82
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:13,120
At a minimum, tags have a chip,
some kilobytes of memory, and antennae.

83
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Memories stores
the information on the tag.

84
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,520
The chip processes this data and
performs the transformation functions.

85
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,802
And the antenna is use to transmit and
receive the RF signals.

86
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:31,200
Tags can be passive or active.

87
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,140
Passive tags take their power from the RF
signals transmitted by the reader.

88
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,190
Active tags have a battery
that powers them.

89
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,640
That's why active tags have a higher cost,
but a longer range.

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,170
A typical range for RFID usage is 1 meter.

91
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:59,000
Cellular technologies is
a very broad term and

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,560
encapsulates a wide range of technologies.

93
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,180
In simple terms, cellular technologies
are those where there are multiple small

94
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,100
interconnected transmitters or
cells instead of one main transmitter.

95
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,180
Another feature is frequency reuse,

96
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,450
where one frequency is used by multiple
cells to increase range and capacity.

97
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:31,280
But these cells, have to be geography
far apart from each other, so

98
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
that there is minimal to no interference.

99
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,170
The most common cellular
technology is GSM.

100
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,390
Most of the world's mobile
network operators use GSM.

101
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,260
GSM also has multiple
standards classified as first,

102
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,140
second, third generation and so on.

103
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,720
The data rates and number of users per
cell improves with each generation.

104
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,620
The current deployed generation is fourth,
or 4G, while 5G is in development.

105
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,800
For every generation,
you can have multiple competing standards.

106
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,471
For example, for 4G, we have two
main competitors, WiMax and LTE.

107
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:26,655
A competing standard to GSM is CDMA.

108
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:32,240
It's not used widely, and
it's mostly limited to United States.

109
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,692
In any case,
your choice of technology can be based on

110
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:44,316
the range you need,
CDMA offers a better range, data rate,

111
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:49,280
LTE offers a better data rate,
local availability,

112
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,170
whichever network is deployed
in your area or cost.

113
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:04,130
6LoWPAN stands for IPv6 over low power
wireless personal area networks.

114
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,920
As the name suggests,
it is a standard that enables the use

115
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,470
of IPv6 on low power edge devices.

116
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:20,130
By natively communicating using
Internet Protocol, 6LoWPAN devices and

117
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,450
networks don't require any special
gateways to connect to other IP networks,

118
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,650
such as the Internet.

119
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,729
Therefore, 6LoWPAN offers
interoperability and

120
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:36,080
simplicity in design compared to ZigBee or
Bluetooth.

121
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,840
Essentially, this standard
enables IPv6 packets to

122
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,190
be transmitted over IEEE 802.15.4,

123
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,570
which is a standard for low data rate
wireless personal area networks.

124
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,868
This makes 6LoWPAN ideal for
cyber physical systems,

125
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:02,220
where IP connectivity and
low power consumption are essential.

126
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,660
In this lesson, we discuss the basics
of some of the important M to

127
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,220
M connectivity protocols or protocols
that mainly reside on the link layer.

128
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,137
In later videos,

129
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:18,371
we will look into communication protocols
that reside on the application layer.

130
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:23,734
