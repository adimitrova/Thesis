hello
,
welcome
back
to
the
course
on
web
connectivity
and
security
in
cyber-physical
systems
.
this
lesson
starts
a
module
on
link
layer
connectivity
protocols
and
application
layer
communication
protocols
.
in
this
video
lecture
,
we
'll
talk
about
connectivity
solutions
available
for
embedded
systems
.
in
other
words
,
we
will
focus
on
machine
to
machine
or
m2m
connectivity
protocols
and
their
basic
characteristics
.
machine
to
machine
connectivity
protocols
facilitate
the
establishment
of
a
connection
between
two
or
more
devices
.
here
we
will
be
discussing
the
protocols
that
reside
on
the
link
layer
of
the
tcp
,
ip
model
.
they
establish
a
path
between
two
end
points
.
for
our
cyber-physical
system
case
,
the
connectivity
solutions
can
broadly
be
divided
into
two
main
categories
,
wired
and
wireless
.
wired
connection
are
the
one
's
that
require
a
physical
connection
between
endpoints
.
while
in
wireless
connections
,
we
do
n't
have
any
physical
medium
.
as
we
will
see
this
classification
affects
the
abilities
of
the
protocols
in
many
ways
.
for
example
range
,
date
rate
,
and
power
consumption
.
wired
connections
generally
tend
to
have
higher
date
rates
and
higher
power
consumption
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
.
there
are
certain
parameters
that
help
us
defining
and
distinguishing
connectivity
protocols
.
mainly
range
,
data
rate
,
power
consumption
,
topology
,
tcp/ip
support
,
spectrum
,
estimated
node
support
,
approximate
cost
.
well
,
each
of
these
will
be
discussed
in
this
lecture
.
the
range
defines
how
far
away
or
to
what
distance
the
protocol
can
offer
connectivity
.
based
on
this
definition
of
range
,
we
divide
the
protocols
broadly
into
four
logical
categories
,
pan
,
lan
,
man
,
and
wan
.
pan
or
personal
area
network
interconnects
devices
within
the
personal
space
of
an
individual
.
the
range
is
typically
from
ten
centimeters
to
ten
meters
.
lan
or
local
area
network
interconnects
devices
within
a
limited
area
such
as
a
home
,
office
,
or
building
.
it
ranges
typically
from
ten
meters
to
some
hundreds
of
meters
.
man
or
a
metropolitan
area
network
interconnects
devices
within
a
city
or
district
covering
several
buildings
,
a
large
university
network
and
a
citywide
municipal
network
are
good
examples
.
the
range
is
typically
from
500
meters
to
some
tens
of
kilometers
.
wan
,
or
wide
area
network
,
generally
has
no
geographical
restrictions
on
its
location
or
size
.
the
wan
enables
different
lans
to
connect
to
each
other
.
although
the
distance
is
not
a
limit
as
such
,
a
wan
can
be
restricted
to
a
specific
country
for
example
.
the
data
rate
defines
how
much
data
per
second
you
can
transfer
.
or
how
much
data
the
protocol
can
theoretically
transfer
per
second
.
in
wireless
networks
,
the
theoretical
maximum
is
generally
quite
different
from
actual
results
.
for
cyber-physical
systems
,
we
divide
the
data
rates
into
low
,
high
and
very
high
categories
.
low
data
rates
transfer
up
to
one
megabits
per
second
.
high
data
rates
more
than
one
to
two
megabits
per
second
.
and
very
high
data
rates
more
than
50
megabits
per
second
.
this
classification
does
n't
apply
when
thinking
in
terms
of
typical
human
usage
of
networks
.
remember
that
two
megabits
per
second
of
sustained
throughput
is
pretty
high
for
most
embedded
systems
,
because
your
smart
energy
meter
or
smart
lighting
system
,
like
philips
hue
,
does
n't
watch
netflix
.
data
transfers
are
typically
periodic
updates
which
do
not
require
high
data
rates
.
power
consumptions
gives
you
an
idea
about
battery
life
and
a
data
throughput
of
your
interconnection
protocol
.
generally
,
the
lower
the
power
consumption
,
the
lower
the
data
rate
.
higher
rates
mean
the
device
is
on
for
longer
periods
of
time
and
has
to
process
more
and
faster
,
thereby
increasing
power
consumption
.
here
we
divide
power
consumption
into
two
categories
,
idle
and
active
.
idle
power
consumption
is
the
power
used
when
the
devices
is
in
the
state
of
rest
.
meaning
,
no
communication
is
taking
place
.
idle
power
is
a
significant
factor
,
for
example
,
in
sensor
networks
.
where
sensors
are
mostly
idle
communication
wise
.
active
power
consumption
is
the
power
used
when
a
device
is
in
the
full
communication
mode
.
this
will
give
you
the
battery
life
of
your
node
when
the
node
is
under
full
communication
load
.
another
consideration
is
whether
the
connectivity
protocol
and
modules
offer
different
power
profiles
.
such
as
idle
state
enabling
profile
,
low
data
rate
profile
,
receive
only
profile
,
and
transmit
only
profile
.
each
of
these
save
battery
power
in
its
own
way
.
the
topology
refers
to
the
interconnection
between
different
nodes
in
the
network
.
there
are
different
ways
a
protocol
might
allow
devices
to
connect
to
each
other
.
the
most
common
or
dominant
ones
are
the
following
.
in
a
bus
topology
there
's
a
central
line
or
bus
and
each
device
is
connected
to
that
line
.
so
logically
each
device
is
directly
connected
to
the
other
devices
.
in
a
star
topology
we
have
a
central
node
or
server
and
each
device
connects
to
this
server
.
in
a
mesh
topology
,
each
device
is
connected
via
point
to
point
links
to
two
or
more
other
devices
.
in
a
full
mesh
topology
,
each
device
is
connected
to
all
other
devices
in
the
network
.
a
tree
topology
is
a
mixture
of
the
star
and
bus
topologies
.
in
a
tree
network
,
two
or
more
star
networks
are
connected
by
a
bus
network
.
an
important
question
is
,
does
the
connectivity
protocol
support
tcp/ip
on
the
higher
layers
?
this
is
essential
in
two
main
ways
.
first
,
supporting
tcp/ip
means
easy
aggressing
and
connectivity
to
existing
internet
or
legacy
systems
that
are
already
deployed
.
second
,
it
makes
web
connectivity
very
easy
.
in
case
there
is
no
support
for
internet
connectivity
,
a
gateway
can
be
used
.
for
example
,
a
large
set
of
smart
tags
can
connect
to
a
central
server
,
which
is
connected
to
the
internet
.
in
this
case
,
the
central
server
is
the
gateway
to
the
internet
for
those
tags
.
gateways
have
their
benefits
and
drawbacks
.
for
example
,
they
add
extra
cost
and
complexity
.
on
the
other
hand
,
they
can
be
used
to
offer
extended
functions
.
a
gateway
could
,
for
example
,
encrypt
data
coming
from
the
tags
before
passing
this
data
to
the
internet
.
or
it
can
manage
authentication
and
limited
access
to
each
tag
.
by
doing
so
the
gateway
essentially
extends
and
complements
the
services
provided
by
the
connectivity
protocols
themselves
.
it
is
important
to
know
which
part
of
the
microwave
spectrum
a
wireless
connectivity
protocol
uses
.
there
might
be
regional
restrictions
on
the
spectrum
which
is
used
by
your
device
.
or
a
device
might
be
operating
in
a
commercial
band
requiring
you
to
get
a
license
to
operate
.
there
are
different
bands
but
for
simplicity
we
can
divide
them
into
two
categories
,
free
and
commercial
.
the
free
band
is
the
portion
of
the
wireless
spectrum
that
does
n't
require
devices
to
have
operating
licenses
.
the
most
common
one
is
the
industry
of
scientific
and
medical
or
ism
band
.
the
frequency
ranges
are
vast
but
as
an
example
bluetooth
and
wifi
operate
in
the
two
point
four
gigahertz
ism
band
.
an
example
of
the
commercial
band
is
900
and
1,800
megahertz
range
used
by
gsm
.
estimated
node
support
is
simple
to
understand
.
it
means
the
number
of
clients
that
can
be
connected
to
each
other
,
either
directly
or
via
gateway
.
there
might
no
theoretical
limit
on
how
many
devices
can
be
connected
.
but
there
comes
a
point
where
the
performance
get
severely
degraded
when
a
lot
of
nodes
are
connect
to
a
single
gateway
,
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
wifi
.
the
last
parameter
is
the
cost
.
when
deploying
a
small
set
of
devices
a
difference
of
some
euros
per
device
might
not
matter
too
much
.
but
when
deploying
hundreds
of
thousands
of
nodes
even
a
few
cents
can
affect
the
overall
price
greatly
.
in
cyber-physical
systems
and
censor
networks
,
the
number
of
nodes
is
often
large
enough
to
make
the
price
a
decisive
factor
in
selecting
the
connectivity
protocol
.
in
this
lecture
,
we
have
defined
the
basic
properties
of
connectivity
protocols
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
have
an
overview
of
a
set
of
popular
connectivity
protocols
.
