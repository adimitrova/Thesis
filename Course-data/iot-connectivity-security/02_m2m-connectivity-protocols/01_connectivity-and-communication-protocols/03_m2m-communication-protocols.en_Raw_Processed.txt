hello, welcome to lesson machine to 
machine mm communication protocols 
they, 
basic characteristics, 
ones dominant ones 
mm communication protocols 
application layer protocols 
that facilitate transfer 
messages between two devices 
an important distinction between 
connectivity communication protocols 
is that mm connectivity protocols 
facilitated linking devices 
reside link layer, while mm 
communication protocols facilitate 
messaging between devices 
reside application layer 
protocols allow devices 
to interoperate 
this standardizing key 
aspects naming, messaging, 
controls 
standardized naming means defining 
device will referred, 
recognized, found 
standard messaging determines 
message is formatted, so 
that devices understand 
standard controls enable devices 
to control flow communication 
quality service, 
to define type a message 
lets a look basic 
features mm communication protocols 
features allow us to 
differentiate protocols, 
to define use cases 
communication pattern refers 
to communication model 
paradigm protocol follows 
an example a communication pattern 
is requestresponse model 
in this model, 
client node sends a request 
to central server node to 
initiate a connection, 
server responds in a predefined 
pattern depending protocol 
another communication pattern 
is publishsubscribe model, 
pubsub in short 
in this paradigm, clients 
connection establishment define 
type messages interested 
in, generally called topics classes 
whenever a client, 
a publisher sends a message 
a specific topic, message is 
forwarded to clients 
subscribers expressed 
interest in topic in question 
application layer protocols 
in scope this course 
assume an underlying transport 
protocol to present 
choice a transport protocol is 
important, effects performance, 
bandwidth, reliability 
mm communication protocol 
main contenders tcp udp 
tcp is used in cases 
reliability is key importance 
udp simple taking 
a few steps to form a connection 
is preferred if speed is 
important factor 
protocol offer 
assurance delivery 
mechanisms to ensure 
transmission messages 
in uncertain circumstances 
unreliable connections 
mechanisms would protocol 
would rely to achieve this 
answers to questions 
define level dependability 
reliability protocol 
a web connected cyber physical 
system inherits problems 
current internet 
likely amplifies them, 
direct 
connection to real world 
two issues security 
privacy 
security is an important differentiating 
factor in choice a protocol 
security aspects systems discussed 
in detail in later video lectures 
distributed operations means 
that there is central node to 
control operation 
communication nodes 
instead, communication is one to one, 
communicating 
nodes equal grounds 
protocols might request that 
data goes first to a central point, 
a server broker, is 
distributed to intended recipient 
able to know 
is network is 
important ability 
to communicate 
protocol may offer means 
machines recognize peers 
associated group members in network 
messages payload support 
a decisive factor in selecting a protocol 
knowing protocol will easily 
integrate current systems 
is valuable 
knowing payload helps in this regard 
current web services 
technologies benefit 
a protocol that offer support 
typical web payloads, 
html, plain text, 
udf coded text xml 
based features we defined, lets 
look dominant protocols today 
constraint application protocol 
coap is a standardized 
request response protocol 
creators redesign functions http 
taking consideration, 
target devices coap will used 
that is embedded devices limited 
processing power, storage, bandwidth 
also supports publishsubscribe style 
communication resource discovery 
coap uses udp transport protocol 
a dual layered structure 
transactional layer takes care 
message handling between nodes, 
request response layer manages 
resources transmits messages 
this enables efficient congestion 
control reliability 
udp here you see a short 
overview protocol 
hypertext transport protocol, http, 
is backbone modern world wide web 
is defacto protocol exchanging 
information between internet connected 
nodes that communicate via hypertext, 
example, browser web server 
http sets regulations 
nodes going to communicate, 
also specifies content 
http relies tcp transport 
protocol packet transmission 
here, you see a short 
overview protocol 
message queuing telemetry transport, 
mqtt, invented ibm 
rcom to collect data remote 
devices to back server 
introduced in ibm, 
standardized in 
mqtt is meant lightweight devices, 
constrained 
processing power memory 
besides this, protocol 
transmit data low bandwidth 
reliable connection 
static header size 
mqtt is bytes 
is an opensource free 
to use standard protocol 
mqtt relies tcp 
transport protocol 
mqtt is inherently a published 
subscribe protocol 
clients connect to a server to send 
receive messages 
channels interest 
server is called a broker, senders 
publishers, receivers subscribers 
here you see a short 
overview protocol 
extensible messaging 
presence protocol 
xmpp originally a textbased 
messaging protocol 
messaging between devices a network 
using xml document format 
xmpp is explored 
internet things xmpp 
standards foundations 
access control censor data 
strong point is familiar 
device server naming approach 
besides this, provides end 
to end security, provisioning, 
publish subscribe style communication 
is slow, secure 
uses tcp transport protocol 
here you see a short 
overview protocol 
data distribution service, 
dds, is a standardized, 
publishsubscribe protocol that enables 
devices to communicate in near realtime 
dds interoperability 
protocol called wire, 
enables different implementations 
dds to communicate interoperate 
in a dds environment, anyone 
a publisher, subscriber 
also offers an extensive quality 
service support allowing efficient 
versatile implementations 
quality service policies 
use either tcp 
udp a transport protocol 
here you see a short 
overview protocol 
advanced message queueing protocol 
amqp roots in 
financial industry 
relies queues between senders 
receivers 
reliability in delivery messages 
amqp uses tcp transport protocol 
allows a server to initiate 
a connection client 
unlike http in connection 
to initiated a client 
anqp is flexible 
offers peertopeer, clienttobroker 
brokertobroker communication 
here is a short overview protocol 
in this lesson, we learned basic 
features mm communication protocols 
studied briefly a set popular 
real world protocols in this category 
in next lesson, we will learn 
use cases connectivity protocols
