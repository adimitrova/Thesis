2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:07,440
Welcome back.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,780
In this lesson, which concludes this
module, we will look into the concept of

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,140
fog computing, its basic ideas,
and expected benefits.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,950
So what is fog computing?

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,420
In another video lecture,

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,390
we talked about Cloud computing where
you transfer all the data generated

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,610
by internet of things devices to
the back-end servers and analyze it there.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:40,250
Each intelligence, or as Cisco calls it,
fog computing is the opposite.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,490
Fog computing suggests that
some processing takes place

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,700
at the end devices or gateways.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,470
It's called Edge Intelligence because

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,388
the computation takes place at
the edge of the network where the data

14
00:00:55,388 --> 00:01:00,320
is initially generated instead of
the core where it is later transferred.

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,245
In this video lecture,

16
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:07,954
we will look into basic concepts of
Edge Intelligence and fog computing.

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,040
There are few drivers for
the trend towards fog computing.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,440
First, big data or
the large amounts of data generated

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,180
by millions of tiny devices can be too
difficult to transfer around the networks.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,430
Moving it from a service to a service or

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,310
from a data center to another will
consume time, energy, and bandwidth.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,500
Second, there is a paradigm, called the
Moore-Nielsen Paradigm, stating that data

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,760
gets accumulated at the edge is faster
than the network can push into the core.

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,220
As an example, a jet engine produces 20
terabytes of data for each flight hour.

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,917
It is not possible to transfer all of
these data to the Cloud in a real time.

26
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,191
The third driver for
fog computing Is the fact that storage and

27
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,280
processing power are becoming very cheap.

28
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,880
So instead of dumb devices that
just pump data back to the core,

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,509
you can have intelligents, or
semi-intelligent ones, at the edges.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,840
Lastly, you need fog computing or
Edge Intelligence to filter

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,530
through all these massive amount of data
before you can transfer it to the Cloud.

32
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,521
Here are some of the characteristics and
benefits of fog computing.

33
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:50,803
Fog computing will offer better latency
and improved location awareness.

34
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:58,450
Different types of nodes will come
together to form fog deployments.

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,060
Fog computing will offer
local analytics and

36
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,220
intelligence at the edge of the network.

37
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,700
Distributed intelligence
will effectively cut

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,260
down the amount of data that is
transferred upwards to the Cloud.

39
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,369
As data is available locally,
local operations can continue to perform,

40
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:30,109
although in a limited capacity even
if the back-end connections are lost.

41
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:37,650
You won't have to move sensitive data,
it will stay close to the source.

42
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,536
Think of patient's medical records being
analyzed locally rather than sending them

43
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:44,349
to the Cloud.

44
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:52,260
Here is a list of different fog IoT
platforms and service providers.

45
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,182
There are not that many providers yet as
fog computing is a relatively new concept.

46
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,471
And here is the summary of
all things Edge Intelligence.

47
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,460
This ends the web connectivity
part of the course.

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,300
Let's walk through what we have
learned in our course so far.

49
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,760
We started with the basics of the
internet, and studied the TCP/IP model.

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,430
We then discussed connectivity
solutions for cyber-physical systems.

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,650
We also discussed some of
the main communication protocols.

52
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,690
Examples of how to build web
connectivity into your design, and

53
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,300
how to design RESTful embedded
web services were presented.

54
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,530
Then we touched on two important
topics in cyber-phyiscal systems or

55
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,460
Internet of Things, Cloud,
IoT, and fog computing.

56
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,024
In the next modules,
we will talk about another major topic

57
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:57,511
related to cyber-physical systems,
namely security.

58
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:03,198
We will go through security protocols and
algorithms and help you understand some of

59
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:09,141
the attacks against cyber-physical systems
and how to defend against these attacks.
