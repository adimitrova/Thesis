00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,860
Welcome to the lesson on cloud
computing and cyber physical systems.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,920
In this video lecture, we will look into
the relationship between cloud computing

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,629
and the future of cyber physical
systems or embedded systems in general.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,480
Let's talk about cloud computing.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,900
In the simplest form,
cloud computing is about utilizing

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,650
computational power as a utility
like electricity or gas.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,927
Instead of building your own
in-house computational capabilities,

9
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:44,423
you rent them out from people
who have already designed them.

10
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:52,970
This model of renting out resources based
on one's needs has several benefits.

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,330
First, flexibility.

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,970
The resources you utilize like storage,
computing capacity or

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,810
network can scale up or
scale down based on your needs.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Second, low maintenance.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,400
As the servers are managed
by your provider,

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,948
you don't have to worry about
maintenance or software updates.

17
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:26,360
Third, paper use, you only pay for
the resources you use.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,774
Fourth, security, cloud services
can maintain better security and

19
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:38,602
hire better professionals compared
to a small business or startup

20
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:45,427
In the words of a researcher
in the field of security,

21
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:48,300
cloud is using somebody else's computer.

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,270
In another lesson, we talked about
different protocols like GSM, Bluetooth,

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,039
and Zigby that enable us to connect
our cyber physical systems.

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,330
We also pointed out the one's that support
GCPIP to enable IP based communication.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,360
When you take a small embedded device and
assign it an IP address,

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,080
you can uniquely identify it,
remotely access and

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,990
control it and
share its data across the internet.

28
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,090
What you have done is that you have
built an Internet of Things device or

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,750
IoT device.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,430
You had a device, a thing, and
you made it a part of the internet.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,540
Irrespective of all the hype and
well justified interest in the Internet of

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,460
Things, at its very basic level,
it is a very large number of embedded

33
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,890
systems talking to each
other via IP networks.

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,440
If you look at it from this perspective,
to an embedded systems engineer, IoT is

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,250
more of an evolution of the technologies
that were already available to him.

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,510
The reason we are talking about
the Internet of Things is that

37
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,150
it shares a lot of similarities
with cyber physical systems.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,660
IoT is about monitoring or sensing the
real world with interconnected sensors.

39
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,610
Cyber physical systems are the same.

40
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,100
Any platform that bills
itself as an IoT platform

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,790
can also be cyber physical
systems platform.

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,940
From now on, in this lesson,
we will use the term IoT

43
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,230
instead of cyber physical
systems as most of

44
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,890
the cloud platforms like to associate
themselves with the Internet of things.

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,640
Cloud computing and
IoT compliment each other very well.

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,010
In the vision of Internet of Things,

47
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,230
you have hundreds of thousands
of sensors generating data.

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,260
Cloud computing helps you store and
process that data.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,057
You can see an example of tracking
people's fitness on the screen.

50
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,919
If you are an IoT device and
network provider,

51
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:24,130
you can focus on your core competence,
building and connecting sensors.

52
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,580
You don't have to worry about
building your own IT infrastructure.

53
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Another problem is making
sense of all that data.

54
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,656
There are cloud computing tools
available that will help you analyze and

55
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,710
generate actionable
intelligence from your data.

56
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,349
If you are monitoring traffic flow or

57
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,654
power consumption in
a large housing society, or

58
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:56,030
monitoring the air quality of a large
city, you need a strong IT infrastructure.

59
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,570
Cloud computing offers you that.

60
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,440
This growing interest in
combining cloud computing and

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,410
Internet of Things has created
on new field called cloud IoT.

62
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,930
Cloud IoT is providing
on demand computational

63
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,929
infrastructure designed specifically for
the Internet of Things.

64
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,310
Cloud IoT providers can
offer different services.

65
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,720
Here are some basic considerations
to look into when choosing one.

66
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,950
Do they offer support for

67
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,060
the communication hardware and
software you will be using?

68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,160
Do they support the communication
protocols you are using in your solution?

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,850
Do they offer you remote
node management like

70
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,790
controlling your device remotely, issuing
commands or upgrading its firmware?

71
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,750
Do they offer any data analytics?

72
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,610
If yes, is it according to your needs?

73
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,690
What kind of pricing model do they have?

74
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,150
Are they charging by the number
of nodes or sensors you have or

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,050
by the number of resources you use?

76
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,680
Here is a short list of different cloud
IOT platforms and service providers.

77
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,060
In this lesson, we looked at
the merging of cloud computing and

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,490
the Internet of Things phenomenon.

79
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,770
The next video lecture,

80
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,065
we will look at a phenomenon that
is opposite to cloud computing.

81
