welcome to lesson cloud 
computing cyber physical systems 
in this video lecture, we will look 
relationship between cloud computing 
future cyber physical 
systems embedded systems in general 
lets talk cloud computing 
in simplest form, 
cloud computing is utilizing 
computational power a utility 
like electricity gas 
instead building 
inhouse computational capabilities, 
you rent people 
already designed 
this model renting resources based 
ones needs several benefits 
first, flexibility 
resources you utilize like storage, 
computing capacity 
network scale 
scale based needs 
second, low maintenance 
servers managed 
provider, 
you dont to worry 
maintenance software updates 
third, paper use, you pay 
resources you use 
fourth, security, cloud services 
maintain better security 
hire better professionals compared 
to a small business startup 
in words a researcher 
in field security, 
cloud is using somebody elses computer 
in another lesson, we talked 
different protocols like gsm, bluetooth, 
zigby that enable us to connect 
cyber physical systems 
we also pointed ones that support 
gcpip to enable ip based communication 
you take a small embedded device 
assign an ip address, 
you uniquely identify it, 
remotely access 
control 
share data across internet 
you done is that you 
built an internet things device 
iot device 
you a device, a thing, 
you made a part internet 
irrespective hype 
well justified interest in internet 
things, basic level, 
is a large number embedded 
systems talking to 
via ip networks 
if you look this perspective, 
to an embedded systems engineer, iot is 
an evolution technologies 
that already available to 
reason we talking 
internet things is that 
shares a lot similarities 
cyber physical systems 
iot is monitoring sensing 
real world interconnected sensors 
cyber physical systems 
platform that bills 
an iot platform 
also cyber physical 
systems platform 
on, in this lesson, 
we will use term iot 
instead cyber physical 
systems 
cloud platforms like to associate 
internet things 
cloud computing 
iot compliment well 
in vision internet things, 
you hundreds thousands 
sensors generating data 
cloud computing helps you store 
process that data 
you see an example tracking 
peoples fitness screen 
if you an iot device 
network provider, 
you focus core competence, 
building connecting sensors 
you dont to worry 
building infrastructure 
another problem is making 
sense that data 
there cloud computing tools 
available that will help you analyze 
generate actionable 
intelligence data 
if you monitoring traffic flow 
power consumption in 
a large housing society, 
monitoring air quality a large 
city, you need a strong infrastructure 
cloud computing offers you that 
this growing interest in 
combining cloud computing 
internet things created 
new field called cloud iot 
cloud iot is providing 
demand computational 
infrastructure designed specifically 
internet things 
cloud iot providers 
offer different services 
here basic considerations 
to look choosing one 
offer support 
communication hardware 
software you will using 
support communication 
protocols you using in solution 
offer you remote 
node management like 
controlling device remotely, issuing 
commands upgrading firmware 
offer data analytics 
if yes, is according to needs 
kind pricing model 
charging number 
nodes sensors you 
number resources you use 
here is a short list different cloud 
iot platforms service providers 
in this lesson, we looked 
merging cloud computing 
internet things phenomenon 
next video lecture, 
we will look a phenomenon that 
is opposite to cloud computing
