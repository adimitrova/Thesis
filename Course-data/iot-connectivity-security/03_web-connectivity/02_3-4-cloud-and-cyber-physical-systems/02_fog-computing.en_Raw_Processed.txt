welcome back 
in this lesson, concludes this 
module, we will look concept 
fog computing, basic ideas, 
expected benefits 
so is fog computing 
in another video lecture, 
we talked cloud computing 
you transfer data generated 
internet things devices to 
backend servers analyze there 
intelligence, cisco calls it, 
fog computing is opposite 
fog computing suggests that 
processing takes place 
end devices gateways 
called edge intelligence 
computation takes place 
edge network data 
is initially generated instead 
core is later transferred 
in this video lecture, 
we will look basic concepts 
edge intelligence fog computing 
there few drivers 
trend towards fog computing 
first, big data 
large amounts data generated 
millions tiny devices 
difficult to transfer around networks 
moving a service to a service 
a data center to another will 
consume time, energy, bandwidth 
second, there is a paradigm, called 
moorenielsen paradigm, stating that data 
gets accumulated edge is faster 
network push core 
an example, a jet engine produces 
terabytes data flight hour 
is possible to transfer 
data to cloud in a real time 
third driver 
fog computing is fact that storage 
processing power becoming cheap 
so instead dumb devices that 
pump data back to core, 
you intelligents, 
semiintelligent ones, edges 
lastly, you need fog computing 
edge intelligence to filter 
massive amount data 
you transfer to cloud 
here characteristics 
benefits fog computing 
fog computing will offer better latency 
improved location awareness 
different types nodes will come 
together to form fog deployments 
fog computing will offer 
local analytics 
intelligence edge network 
distributed intelligence 
will effectively cut 
amount data that is 
transferred upwards to cloud 
data is available locally, 
local operations continue to perform, 
although in a limited capacity even 
if backend connections lost 
you wont to move sensitive data, 
will stay close to source 
think patients medical records 
analyzed locally rather sending 
to cloud 
here is a list different fog iot 
platforms service providers 
there that many providers yet 
fog computing is a relatively new concept 
here is summary 
things edge intelligence 
this ends web connectivity 
part course 
lets walk we 
learned in course so far 
we started basics 
internet, studied tcpip model 
we discussed connectivity 
solutions cyberphysical systems 
we also discussed 
main communication protocols 
examples to build web 
connectivity design, 
to design restful embedded 
web services presented 
we touched two important 
topics in cyberphyiscal systems 
internet things, cloud, 
iot, fog computing 
in next modules, 
we will talk another major topic 
related to cyberphysical systems, 
namely security 
we will go security protocols 
algorithms help you understand 
attacks cyberphysical systems 
to defend attacks 
sound
