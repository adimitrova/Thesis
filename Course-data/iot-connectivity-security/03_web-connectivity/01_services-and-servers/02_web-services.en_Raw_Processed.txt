sound welcome back 
in this video lecture, we will look 
technologies that allow you to 
interact different web services 
benefit web connectivity 
is that you utilize 
interact different web services 
services developed 
perfected vendors 
example, if you want to build user 
authentication product, 
you use authy 
authy is a web service that 
provides two factor authentication 
in another video, we discussed 
a temperature sensor a web server 
if you want that temperature sensor 
to send you a tweet every alert, 
you call twitters api 
application programming interface service 
you running onboard storage 
call amazon web services api 
load data to 
amazons data centers 
this is possible we 
standard ways to connect 
to web services 
in this lesson, 
we will look two major classes 
technologies, rest soap 
we get that, we will look 
data formats that use 
lets start json 
json is a textbased data 
serialization format 
stands javascript object notation 
json is made two structures, 
objects arrays 
objects start end curly brackets 
arrays start end square brackets 
data is in name value pairs 
one set 
pair data is separated 
another a comma 
this is pretty much 
basics json 
screen you see 
an example json object plants 
data is in name value pairs, pairs 
separated commas 
we also an array 
three objects in 
in json, everything nested 
you see here that we an array 
objects that is a part 
a larger object, plants 
if we want to represent that 
data in xml, will look like this 
xml stands extensible markup language 
is another data encoding format 
like json is also textbased 
chat protocol xmpp uses xml based 
objects to send receive messages 
example that you see 
screen is pretty simple 
xml is relatively complex 
old microsoft office word files 
an extension doc 
doc 
newer ones docx docx 
that last x in docx stands xml 
this is whole structure 
newer word documents is formatted in xml 
xml is an open standard, 
applications besides 
microsoft office also accurately 
read format docx files 
back to web services 
we describe two 
data exchange formats 
we will describe two 
common specifications 
implementing a web service 
rest stands representation 
state transfer 
lays ground rules 
to design web services 
rest is a protocol 
a style designing services 
is also protocol independent, 
is generally paired http 
salient features rest 
shown screen 
we will discuss in much 
detail in a later video 
this style designing web 
services easily translated 
embedded systems 
in short, every service, 
we a url 
we interact that service via http 
methods 
basic principles rest are, 
keep design limited to 
http methods like get put 
request independent 
previous next one 
service you 
a separate uri 
data exchange format json, 
xml 
generally, is json 
soap stands 
simple object access protocol 
is another method 
interacting web services 
relies xml like rest, 
is protocol platform independent 
protocol three 
main characteristics 
extensibility, meaning 
supports expansion 
there several extensions available 
that you use that soap 
neutrality in this case means 
is protocol neutral 
independence platform 
programming language 
developers use 
programming model see fit, 
whether is objectoriented 
agentoriented dataflowbased 
so, one you use 
sometimes you dont really a choice 
if you interacting a web service, 
you will to use technology 
that used 
if youre building youre web service, 
you a choice 
basic difference is between 
two candidates outlined here 
rest is lighter soap in 
terms network resources 
rest is power efficient 
soap in small embedded systems 
is also simpler 
hand, 
soap offers better security 
many extensions 
is inherently protocol independent 
also rest is protocol independent in 
principle, is generally bound to http 
in this lesson, 
we looked technologies 
data formats that allow us to 
interact web services 
in next video lecture, we will learn 
restful web services in detail
