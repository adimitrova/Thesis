hello, welcome back 
in previous lesson, 
we looked security requirements 
cyberphysical systems 
in this video lecture, we will learn 
fundamental security concepts 
methods that provide security 
cyber physical systems 
confidentiality is one 
important aspect security 
confidentiality refers to 
protecting personal privacy 
proprietary information 
unauthorized access 
is important to protect 
information disclosed to people 
eligible to access 
in cases, confidentiality 
is roughly equivalent to privacy 
in cyberphysical systems due to 
heterogeneous nature system 
physically observable outputs 
events, information flow is complex, 
resulting in a greater risk 
confidentiality privacy violations 
encryption is one 
efficient methods protecting 
confidentiality data in systems 
cryptographic solutions, however, 
involves complex computations that 
require sufficient amount computing 
power to applicable in system 
using encryption in cyberphysical 
systems restrictions 
due to limited computing 
storage capacity devices 
in cases, 
also limited energy available devices 
so in order to deal this problem, 
lightweight cryptographic 
mechanisms applied 
data cyberphysical systems must 
encrypted is stored 
transferred 
in addition to encrypting data, is 
also important to limit access to data 
proper access control system will 
guarantee that data is accessible 
to authorized people devices 
besides controlling logical access to 
computings, resources, network data 
also physical access to system components, 
computing hardware, sensors, 
actuators even monitor environment 
if possible needs to restricted 
logical access control is accomplished 
an access control policy 
wellknown access control policies 
role based access control rbac 
mandatory access control mac 
identity based access control ibac 
confidentiality could 
compromised in different ways 
example, a physical network 
line could attacked wire 
tapping line to monitor 
record network communication 
in this case, 
if communication is encrypted, 
data will accessible 
to attacker 
a password attack is another 
type confidentiality attack, 
exploits passwords using 
different cracking tools 
tools try several different 
combinations commonly used words 
to crack a password 
this is choosing a strong 
password is important 
a strong password is 
difficult to crack tools 
you find good tips choosing 
a strong password internet 
phishing pharming is another 
way acquiring passwords 
sensitive information 
in a phishing attack, 
victim receives an email 
another type message that appears 
to send unknown contact 
email might contain malware 
infected attachments 
provide a link to a fake looking page 
integrity is another aspect security 
integrity involves maintaining 
consistency, accuracy 
trustworthiness data 
entire lifecycle 
integrity ensures that information is 
modified unauthorized entities 
in addition to data, 
integrity is also required 
physical components systems 
physical integrity 
a system ensures that 
physical devices composing 
a system cannot modified 
tamper proof hardware is one way 
ensuring physical integrity 
in cyberphysical systems 
hardware is resistant 
tampering deliver a changes 
physical tamper resistant systems 
developed to process 
store critical information 
one way ensuring data 
integrity is hashing 
hashing is transforming a large 
amount data, example, 
text a short a fixed length 
piece data called a hash value 
idea is that initial data cannot 
obtained based hash value 
this means that hash function 
transformation 
is a one way algorithm 
if a single bit is changed in data, 
hash function will probably use 
a totally different hash value 
in order to ensure integrity data, 
hash value data is computed 
kept secret 
to check if data 
modified point, 
hash value is computed 
compared to initial hash value 
if two hash values identical, 
data altered 
another aspect integrity 
is configuration integrity 
we assume here that a system 
a set functional parameters 
that take different values in 
different operating scenarios 
example, a sensor could set 
to read every ten seconds 
data could set to streamed to 
cloud sever every five minutes 
if configuration 
parameters tampered with, 
system may behave unexpectedly 
even crash 
therefore, configuration integrity 
is a important requirement 
security cyberphysical systems 
a reliable way ensuring 
configuration integrity is to implement 
a dedicated secure configuration 
management system 
code integrity is also 
utmost importance 
means ensuring that embedded 
program code running 
components system 
cannot altered an attacker 
software this station is a challenge 
response technique that enables checking 
integrity memory contents 
devices malicious modifications 
could used, example, to verify 
code integrity sensors actuators 
integrity attacks a significant 
impact cyberphysical system 
a single integrity attack might 
a minor attack, 
if runs a long period time 
multiple devices simultaneously, 
results in a larger 
severe attack overall 
example, in a salami attack, 
various small changes 
made time 
if small changes made 
in a large amount data 
devices, will a severe impact 
a maninthemiddle attack is another 
type integrity attack in 
attacker tries to intercept 
communication between two devices in 
order to manipulate data 
maninthemiddle attack also 
considered a confidentiality attack 
availability is another important 
aspect information security in 
cyberphysical systems 
availability refers to ensuring 
that authorized parties 
able to access information 
resources whenever needed 
this means that components 
a cyberphysical system, 
including sensors, actuators, 
computing storage systems, 
security solutions communication 
channels must functioning correctly, 
so that system is 
available needed 
in critical applications, systems need 
to available basically time 
in critical systems, 
tolerated system downtime 
less a few seconds 
imagine impact an interruption 
caused availability attacks to 
a critical infrastructure, 
a nuclear power plant 
availability attacks target 
different parts system 
regarding cyberphysical systems, 
availability attacks highly 
critical, unsupervised 
autonomous nature systems 
common availability attack is 
called a denial service attack 
dos attack 
ddos attack, stands 
distributed denial service attack 
is a advanced form dos attack 
is carried multiple sources, 
simultaneously 
ddos a higher impact 
is difficult to track, tackle 
another way attacking availability 
a system is to interrupt 
electrical power system 
lastly, since several physical systems 
exposed to physical environments 
interact them, 
physical protection systems 
is also important to 
avoid availability problems 
in this lesson, 
we discuss basic security 
concepts in cyberphysical systems 
namely, confidentiality, 
integrity availability 
we also learn potential 
attacks 
in next video lecture, 
we will learn attack modules 
in cyberphysical systems context
