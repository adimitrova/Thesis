hi, welcome back to video 
lectures web connectivity 
security in cyberphysical systems 
this lesson starts second 
part course 
this part includes two modules, 
dedicated to system security 
issues solutions 
we will learn different 
security technologies methods 
learn to utilize in securing 
protecting cyber physical 
systems cyber attacks 
in this video lecture, 
we will look basic security 
requirements cyber physical systems 
several physical systems facilitate 
a wide range solutions 
services that help people 
in daily lives 
however, providing solutions 
services in a reliable safe 
secure manner is trivial 
contrary, 
there many challenging issues that 
need to appropriately addressed 
example, dealing sensitive 
safetycritical data, 
if this data is properly protected, 
lead to significant financial losses, 
loss privacy reputation, 
mental suffering physical damage 
could even endanger lives 
so, among issues 
challenges involved in design 
deployment cyber physical systems, 
security a important role 
cyber physical systems 
specific security issues 
this is 
special characteristics 
first all, 
involving physical processes, 
tightly coupled 
physical environments 
so changes in environments, 
especially expected changes that 
havent considered design time 
will affect them, potentially make 
vulnerable to security breaches 
this is true way around well 
security breaches in 
cyberphysical systems 
serious influence 
environments 
second, cyberphysical systems 
composed a large number 
different devices different 
computing platforms capabilities 
in general, devices in cyber physical 
systems resource constrained, 
meaning that dont 
much processing, 
storage, power capacity to 
execute complex operations 
this poses challenges 
applying efficient security 
countermeasures that may require 
a relatively high amount resources 
third, cyberphysical systems 
massively networked systems 
use various 
communication technologies 
between devices ranging 
simple wired connections 
to different wireless technologies 
different ranges characteristics 
so highly complex 
heterogeneous systems making 
harder to find optimal solutions 
to ensure secure transmission 
data everywhere in system 
finally, cyber physical 
systems typically 
highly autonomous embedded 
intelligence controlling many operations 
this reduces need 
manual control supervision 
one hand is an advantage, 
risk human error is reduced 
hand, user must 
able to rely autonomous system 
to protected malicious 
attacks that aim to secretly alter 
behavior system, 
to steal sensitive information 
in general, we classify 
security requirements cyber 
physical systems several categories 
in a system, interacts 
a physical environment, 
validity 
accuracy sensed data is important 
so, proper protection sensors 
data is high 
importance in a system 
data collected multiple sensors 
needs to store temporarily 
malicious unauthorized modification 
this stored data results in errors 
is processing 
serious consequences 
this reason, data while 
in storage needs to protected 
unauthorized access 
modification 
in large cyber physical systems, 
data may collected 
a large group sensors 
time period resulting in a 
large set data beak data 
data you 
complex 
difficult is to 
properly secure this data 
many cyber physical systems 
networked distributed 
sensitive data is transmitted 
heterogeneous communication channels 
communication security is needed 
within a system between systems 
we will discuss different communication 
security protocols in video 
lectures 
in a system carries autonomous 
operations actuators, 
is key importance to make sure 
that actuations authorized 
according to latest 
policies system 
feedback loops play an important role 
in cyber physical system control 
a systems embedded intelligence 
ability to learn largely based 
feedback actuations 
therefore feedback data needs to 
appropriately protected 
tampering attempts 
finally, system may 
application specific security 
requirements, depending nature 
applications running in system 
cyber physical systems 
physical cyber aspects that 
need to taken account 
designing security counter measures 
in developing security solutions 
cyber physical systems, 
we need to keep in mind that 
attacks also indirect 
meaning that aim to 
affect physical environment in 
a way that data coming 
sensors is corrupted 
misleading resulting in unexpected 
behavior even system failure 
system needs to designed to 
detect abnormal physical conditions, 
act in a safe way in situations 
also, system always 
protected physical tampering 
whenever possible 
security counter measures 
must considered 
in design phase 
a cyber physical system 
security design means 
designing system free 
vulnerabilities 
resistant attacks possible 
this achieved continuous 
testing careful design rigorous 
authentication solutions hardware 
software components system 
in this lesson, 
we discussed different security 
requirements cyberphysical systems 
in next video lecture, 
we will learn key 
security concepts in 
cyberphysical systems
