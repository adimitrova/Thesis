2
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:09,852
Hi, welcome back to the video
lectures on web connectivity and

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,360
security in cyber-physical systems.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,370
This lesson starts the second
part of the course.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,880
This part includes two modules, and

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,760
it's dedicated to system security
issues and their solutions.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,910
We will learn about different
security technologies and methods and

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,370
learn how to utilize these in securing and

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,980
protecting cyber physical
systems against cyber attacks.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,610
In this video lecture,

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,169
we will look into basic security
requirements of cyber physical systems.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,330
Several physical systems facilitate
a wide range of solutions and

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,510
services that help people
in their daily lives.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,070
However, providing these solutions and
services in a reliable safe and

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,835
secure manner is not at all trivial.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,620
On the contrary,

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,690
there are many challenging issues that
need to be appropriately addressed.

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,420
For example, dealing with sensitive or
safety-critical data,

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,174
if this data is not properly protected,
can lead to significant financial losses,

20
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:25,550
loss of privacy or reputation,
mental suffering or physical damage.

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,750
It could even endanger lives.

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,288
So, among issues and
challenges involved in design and

23
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:40,108
deployment of cyber physical systems,
security has a very important role.

24
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:48,670
Cyber physical systems have their
own specific security issues.

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,220
This is because of their
special characteristics.

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,010
First of all,
as they are involving physical processes,

27
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,109
they are tightly coupled with
their physical environments.

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,450
So any changes in their environments,

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,890
especially on expected changes that
haven't been considered at design time

30
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,030
will affect them, and potentially make
them more vulnerable to security breaches.

31
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,710
This is true the other way around as well.

32
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,410
Security breaches in
cyber-physical systems

33
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,470
can have serious influence
on their environments.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,530
Second, cyber-physical systems can be
composed of a very large number of

35
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,539
different devices with different
computing platforms and capabilities.

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,930
In general, most devices in cyber physical
systems are resource constrained,

37
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,560
meaning that they don't
have much processing,

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,579
storage, or power capacity to
execute complex operations.

39
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,075
This poses challenges for
applying efficient security

40
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:06,420
counter-measures that may require
a relatively high amount of resources.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,479
Third, cyber-physical systems can
be massively networked systems.

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,230
They can use various
communication technologies

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,140
between devices ranging from
simple wired connections

44
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,780
to different wireless technologies with
different ranges and characteristics.

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,640
So they can be highly complex and

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,700
heterogeneous systems making it
harder to find optimal solutions

47
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,670
to ensure secure transmission of
data everywhere in the system.

48
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,820
Finally, cyber physical
systems are typically

49
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,839
highly autonomous with embedded
intelligence controlling many operations.

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,320
This reduces the need for
manual control and supervision.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,890
Which on one hand is an advantage, because
the risk for human error is reduced.

52
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,254
On the other hand, the user must be
able to rely on the autonomous system

53
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:17,076
to be protected against malicious
attacks that aim to secretly alter

54
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:21,671
the behavior of the system, or
to steal sensitive information.

55
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:29,939
In general, we can classify
the security requirements of cyber

56
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,353
physical systems into several categories.

57
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:40,375
In a system, which interacts
with a physical environment,

58
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:45,020
validity and
accuracy of sensed data is very important.

59
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,670
So, proper protection of sensors and

60
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,430
their data is of high
importance in such a system.

61
00:04:56,345 --> 00:05:00,800
Data collected from multiple sensors
needs to be store temporarily.

62
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,190
Malicious unauthorized modification of
this stored data results in errors and

63
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,349
is further processing and
can have serious consequences.

64
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,765
For this reason, the data while
in storage needs to be protected

65
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:23,791
against any unauthorized access and
modification.

66
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:29,363
In some large cyber physical systems,

67
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:34,331
the data may be collected from
a very large group of sensors over

68
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:39,600
some time period resulting in a very
large set of data or beak data.

69
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,430
The more data you have
the more complex and

70
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,460
difficult it is to
properly secure this data.

71
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,640
Many cyber physical systems
are networked and distributed.

72
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,070
Sensitive data is transmitted through
heterogeneous communication channels.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,690
Communication security is needed
within a system and between systems.

74
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,416
We will discuss different communication
security protocols in other video

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,114
lectures.

76
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:20,884
In a system which carries out autonomous
operations through its actuators,

77
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:26,464
it is of key importance to make sure
that all actuations are authorized and

78
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:30,160
according to the latest
policies of the system.

79
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Feedback loops play an important role
in cyber physical system control.

80
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,320
A system's embedded intelligence and

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,629
ability to learn are largely based
on feedback of its actuations.

82
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,590
Therefore the feedback data needs to
be appropriately protected against

83
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,060
tampering attempts.

84
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:02,029
Finally, the system may have some
application specific security

85
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:07,990
requirements, depending on the nature of
the applications running in the system.

86
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,540
Cyber physical systems have both
physical and cyber aspects that

87
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,890
need to be taken into account when
designing security counter measures.

88
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,130
In developing security solutions for
cyber physical systems,

89
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,850
we need to keep in mind that
attacks can also be indirect

90
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,350
meaning that they can aim to
affect the physical environment in

91
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,850
such a way that data coming
from sensors is corrupted and

92
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,370
misleading resulting in unexpected
behavior or even system failure.

93
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,320
The system needs to be designed to
detect abnormal physical conditions, and

94
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,830
act in a safe way in these situations.

95
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,190
Also, the system should always be
protected against physical tampering

96
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,120
whenever possible.

97
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,520
Security counter measures
must be considered

98
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,120
in the design phase of
a cyber physical system.

99
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,530
Security by design means
designing the system as free of

100
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,430
vulnerabilities and
resistant against attacks as possible.

101
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,420
This can be achieved by continuous
testing and careful design of rigorous

102
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,020
authentication solutions and hardware and
software components of the system.

103
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,431
In this lesson,

104
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:39,159
we discussed different security
requirements of cyber-physical systems.

105
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,986
In the next video lecture,
we will learn more about the key

106
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:48,134
security concepts in
cyber-physical systems.
