2
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:07,921
Hello, welcome back.

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,454
In the previous lesson,

4
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:13,548
we looked at security requirements
of cyber-physical systems.

5
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:18,370
In this video lecture, we will learn
about fundamental security concepts and

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,110
methods that provide security for
cyber physical systems.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,350
Confidentiality is one of the most
important aspect of security.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,810
Confidentiality refers to
protecting personal privacy and

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,019
proprietary information
from unauthorized access.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,790
It is very important to protect such
information from being disclosed to people

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,550
who are not eligible to access it.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,014
In most of the cases, confidentiality
is roughly equivalent to privacy.

13
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:58,710
In cyber-physical systems due to
the heterogeneous nature of the system and

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,730
physically observable outputs or
events, information flow is complex,

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,140
resulting in a greater risk of
confidentiality and privacy violations.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,460
Encryption is one of the most
efficient methods of protecting

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,839
confidentiality of data in systems.

18
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,820
Cryptographic solutions, however,
involves complex computations that

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,770
require sufficient amount of computing
power to be applicable in the system.

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,800
Using encryption in cyber-physical
systems has some restrictions

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,280
due to limited computing and
storage capacity of devices.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,970
And in some cases,
also limited energy available for devices.

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,996
So in order to deal with this problem,

24
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:55,001
lightweight cryptographic
mechanisms should be applied.

25
00:01:55,001 --> 00:02:00,133
Data and cyber-physical systems must
be encrypted when it is stored or

26
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,250
transferred.

27
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:12,210
In addition to encrypting data, it is
also important to limit access to data.

28
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,850
The proper access control system will
guarantee that data is accessible

29
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,760
only to authorized people or devices.

30
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,580
Besides controlling logical access to
computings, resources, network and data.

31
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:37,090
Also physical access to system components,
such as computing hardware, sensors,

32
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,990
actuators and even monitor environment
if possible needs to be restricted.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,370
Logical access control is accomplished
by an access control policy.

34
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:57,320
Some well-known access control policies
are Role Based Access Control or RBAC.

35
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,630
Mandatory Access Control or MAC and
Identity based Access Control or IBAC.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,550
Confidentiality could be
compromised in different ways.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,240
For example, a physical network
line could be attacked by wire

38
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,200
tapping the line to monitor and
record network communication.

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,220
In this case,
if the communication is not encrypted,

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,910
the data will be accessible
to the attacker.

41
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,750
A password attack is another
type of confidentiality attack,

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,360
which exploits passwords using
different cracking tools.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,550
Such tools try several different
combinations of most commonly used words

44
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,600
to crack a password.

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,550
This is why choosing a strong
password is very important.

46
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,230
A strong password is more
difficult to crack for the tools.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,225
You can find some good tips on choosing
a strong password on the internet.

48
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,026
Phishing or pharming is another
way of acquiring passwords and

49
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,572
other sensitive information.

50
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:14,868
In a phishing attack,
the victim receives an email or

51
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:20,316
another type of message that appears
to be send by unknown contact.

52
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:24,185
The email might contain malware
infected attachments or

53
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,610
provide a link to a fake looking page

54
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:35,210
Integrity is another aspect of security.

55
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,903
Integrity involves maintaining
the consistency, accuracy and

56
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:45,572
trustworthiness of data
over its entire lifecycle.

57
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:52,645
Integrity ensures that information is
not modified by unauthorized entities.

58
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:59,677
In addition to data,
integrity is also required for

59
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:02,130
physical components of systems.

60
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,920
Physical integrity of
a system ensures that

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,620
the physical devices composing
a system cannot be modified.

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,150
Tamper proof hardware is one way
of ensuring physical integrity

63
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,097
in cyber-physical systems.

64
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,188
Such hardware is resistant against
tampering or deliver a changes.

65
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:30,305
Physical tamper resistant systems
are developed to process or

66
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,332
store critical information.

67
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,350
One way of ensuring data
integrity is hashing.

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,780
Hashing is transforming a large
amount of data, for example,

69
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,670
text into a short and a fixed length
piece of data called a hash value.

70
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,320
The idea is that the initial data cannot
be obtained based on the hash value.

71
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,430
This means that the hash function
which does the transformation

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,840
is a one way algorithm.

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,190
If a single bit is changed in data,

74
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,380
the hash function will probably use
a totally different hash value.

75
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,390
In order to ensure integrity of data,
the hash value of data is computed and

76
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,250
kept secret.

77
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,401
To check if data has been
modified at some point,

78
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:29,504
the hash value is computed and
compared to the initial hash value.

79
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:34,611
If the two hash values are identical,
then the data has not been altered.

80
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:43,512
Another aspect of integrity
is configuration integrity.

81
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:48,572
We assume here that a system has
a set of functional parameters

82
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:54,135
that can take different values in
different operating scenarios.

83
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:58,972
For example, a sensor could be set
to be read every ten seconds or

84
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:04,270
data could be set to be streamed to
the cloud sever every five minutes.

85
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,724
If such configuration
parameters are tampered with,

86
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:15,343
the system may behave unexpectedly or
even crash.

87
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:20,830
Therefore, configuration integrity
is a very important requirement for

88
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,798
security of cyber-physical systems.

89
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:28,550
A reliable way of ensuring
configuration integrity is to implement

90
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,480
a dedicated secure configuration
management system.

91
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,969
Code integrity is also
of utmost importance.

92
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,170
It means ensuring that the embedded
program code running on

93
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,070
the components of the system
cannot be altered by an attacker.

94
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,859
Software at this station is a challenge
response technique that enables checking

95
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:02,669
the integrity of the memory contents of
devices against malicious modifications.

96
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,514
It could be used, for example, to verify
code integrity of sensors and actuators.

97
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:16,757
Integrity attacks can have a significant
impact on cyber-physical system.

98
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,590
A single integrity attack might
be a minor attack, as such.

99
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,965
But if it runs over a long period of time
or on multiple devices simultaneously,

100
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:35,532
it results in a larger and
severe attack overall.

101
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:38,058
For example, in a salami attack,

102
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:41,641
only various small changes
are made at the time.

103
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:47,270
But if such small changes are made
in a large amount of data or

104
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,109
devices, it will have a severe impact.

105
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:56,103
A man-in-the-middle attack is another
type of integrity attack in which

106
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,940
the attacker tries to intercept
the communication between two devices in

107
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,747
order to manipulate data.

108
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:08,040
The man-in-the-middle attack can also
be considered a confidentiality attack.

109
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:17,147
Availability is another important
aspect of information security in

110
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,949
cyber-physical systems.

111
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,690
Availability refers to ensuring
that authorized parties

112
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,550
are able to access information and
resources whenever needed.

113
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,906
This means that all components
of a cyber-physical system,

114
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:40,129
including the sensors, actuators,
computing and storage systems,

115
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:46,136
security solutions and communication
channels must be functioning correctly,

116
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:49,459
so that the system is
available when needed.

117
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,996
In critical applications, systems need
to be available basically all the time.

118
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,620
In some critical systems,

119
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,560
the tolerated system downtime
can be less than a few seconds.

120
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,208
Imagine the impact of an interruption
caused by availability attacks to

121
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,109
a critical infrastructure,
such as a nuclear power plant.

122
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:20,840
Availability attacks can target
different parts of the system.

123
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:27,240
Regarding cyber-physical systems,
availability attacks can be highly

124
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,280
critical, because of the unsupervised and
autonomous nature of such systems.

125
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,245
The most common availability attack is
called a Denial of Service attack or

126
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,239
DoS attack.

127
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,690
DDoS attack, which stands for

128
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,050
Distributed Denial of Service attack
is a more advanced form of DoS attack.

129
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,702
It is carried out from multiple sources,
simultaneously.

130
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:59,335
DDoS has a higher impact and
is more difficult to track, and tackle.

131
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:07,512
Another way of attacking availability
of a system is to interrupt

132
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:10,050
electrical power of the system.

133
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,119
Lastly, since several physical systems
are exposed to physical environments and

134
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:22,448
interact with them,
physical protection of these systems

135
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,616
is also very important to
avoid availability problems.

136
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,652
In this lesson,

137
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:32,030
we discuss the basic security
concepts in cyber-physical systems.

138
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,890
Namely, confidentiality,
integrity and availability.

139
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,744
We also learn about potential
attacks against them.

140
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,325
In the next video lecture,

141
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:48,087
we will learn more about attack modules
in the cyber-physical systems context.

142
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:53,404
