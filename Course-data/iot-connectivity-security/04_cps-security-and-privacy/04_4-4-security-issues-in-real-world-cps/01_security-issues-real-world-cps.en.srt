00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,810
Hello, welcome back to the course
on web connectivity and

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,480
security in cyber physical systems.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,890
This is the last lesson in the module,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,320
introduction to cyber physical
systems security and privacy.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,930
In the previous lessons of this
module we have learned about

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,280
security challenges,
countermeasures, and attack models.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,390
In this video excerpt,
we will explore security and

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,089
privacy issues of important real world
cyber physical systems called smart grids.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,200
The next generation of power systems
involves a variety of smart devices and

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,640
technologies, such as smart meters,
smart appliances,

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,300
renewable energy resources, and
energy efficiency resources.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,030
Such devices and technologies are key
components of a smart electrical grid.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,651
Security is a critical issue in smart
grids, because they involve critical

15
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,970
power facilities through millions of
interconnected electronic devices.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,586
As you can see on the screen,
a grid of renewable energy resources,

17
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:23,920
transmission lines, distribution centers,

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,290
service providers, and smart electricity
consumers forms a smart grid.

19
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,500
In order to provide a service,
information is collected and communicated

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,440
between the components through
a distributed and hierarchical network.

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,050
Reliability, safety, and
usability of these services

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,950
are highly dependent on security
of smart grid networks.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,300
Based on its features, the smart grid is
vulnerable to different kinds of attacks.

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,420
Next, some of the most common
attack types are introduced.

25
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,890
Like many other networks
also the smart grid

26
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,490
suffers from denial of service attacks.

27
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:13,640
These attacks can target different
layers of the smart grid network

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,660
in different ways.

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,450
In the physical layer, channel jamming
is the most common attack type,

30
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,390
especially in wireless communication.

31
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,268
Since it's easier for an attacker to
intercept wireless communication channels

32
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,410
than authenticated networks.

33
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,672
In the media access control or
a MAC layer, by spoofing MAC parameters,

34
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:42,339
an attacker has a better chance
to access the network in

35
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:47,205
order to reduce the performance of
shared communication channels, and

36
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:50,979
compromise availability and
integrity of the system.

37
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:57,383
In the network and
the transport layers, denial-of-service

38
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:02,131
attacks can reduce the end-to-end
communication performance.

39
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,740
Especially worm propagation and
traffic flooding in these layers

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,480
can considerably reduce the communication
speed, and thereby the overall

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,540
performance of the smart grid.

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,750
In the application layer, an attacker
targets machine's resources, such as CPU

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,130
or I/O bandwidth by exhausting resources
of smart devices and computer systems.

44
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,220
In a smart grid, majority of computing and

45
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,630
communication devices are resource
constrained, and therefore,

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,730
this kind of attack is very serious and
threatening for a smart grid.

47
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,670
In addition to denial of service attacks,
which may target the availability,

48
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,300
smart grids are also vulnerable
to some other attack types

49
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,610
which target integrity and confidentiality
of the customer's information.

50
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,364
For example, usage and pricing
information and also power system values,

51
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,006
such as device readings.

52
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:16,307
Such attacks are more complicated and

53
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:20,040
less brute force than
denial of service attacks.

54
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,759
The risks of integrity attacks
are very high and real.

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,800
False data injection is an example
of an integrity attack,

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,580
which influences both users and suppliers.

57
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,710
In this type of attack the attacker
compromises a number of

58
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,839
measuring devices to
inject false information.

59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,190
This attack can have a long-term and
heavy impact on smart grid systems,

60
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,920
resulting in a significant
financial loss for the suppliers.

61
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,410
On the other hand, attacks which target
the confidentiality of information

62
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,180
are not meant to modify the information,
but

63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,540
to gain knowledge about
sensitive information.

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,850
Eavesdropping is one of the main
attack types in this category.

65
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,570
Targeted information is typically
a customer's account number or

66
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,780
electricity usage.

67
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,300
Data security and
privacy are a top concern in smart grids.

68
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,930
Utilization of cloud computing for
data storage and

69
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,485
processing has caused even
more problems for smart grids.

70
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:42,175
Indeed, the wide range and large amount
of data originating from multiple

71
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:48,420
sources makes it challenging to guarantee
data security and privacy in the grid.

72
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,630
Especially if data, either public or
private, has multiple owners.

73
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,010
It is more probable that personally
identifiable information

74
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,210
will be eventually passed and
revealed if not handled carefully.

75
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,530
This naturally compromises
the privacy of smart grid users.

76
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,130
Similar privacy issues are also present

77
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,660
when transforming data by
aggregating it from multiple owners.

78
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,800
From the system performance point of view,
enforcing security and

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,816
privacy measures leads to
finer granularity of data.

80
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:35,370
That is more control information
is embedded in data,

81
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,130
and this might cause unacceptable
latencies in some cases.

82
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,360
User-centric access

83
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,730
control approaches provide flexibility for
the users to control

84
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,768
access to their own data,
which is stored in a shared environment.

85
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:59,050
In these approaches,
the access control policies

86
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,510
could be set to change dynamically
based on some external information,

87
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,180
such as the social media
activities of the users.

88
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,260
Dynamically changing
access control policies

89
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,500
impose a high cost in terms
of system complexity.

90
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,500
Due to its nature, the data in
the smart grid needs to be archived for

91
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,630
a long period of time.

92
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,410
Storing the data for a long time requires
more powerful cryptographic solutions,

93
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,180
because a computational
ability to break cryptographic

94
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,240
algorithms increase with time.

95
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,860
In addition, the user's perception and
requirements for

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,700
privacy can change over time.

97
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,020
With this in mind, the system
should be designed in such a way

98
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,850
that there is a built in tolerance for
changes in security and

99
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,130
privacy measures for
long-term archive data.

100
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,650
In this lesson,
which concludes the module,

101
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,800
Introduction to Cyber-Physical Systems,

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,450
Security, and Privacy,
we looked into some security issues

103
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,240
of smart grid networks as an example
of real world cyber-physical systems.

104
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,510
In the next module, we are going to
learn about cryptographic solutions for

105
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,615
securing cyber physical systems.
