hello, welcome back to course 
web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
this is last lesson in module, 
introduction to cyber physical 
systems security privacy 
in previous lessons this 
module we learned 
security challenges, 
countermeasures, attack models 
in this video excerpt, 
we will explore security 
privacy issues important real world 
cyber physical systems called smart grids 
next generation power systems 
involves a variety smart devices 
technologies, smart meters, 
smart appliances, 
renewable energy resources, 
energy efficiency resources 
devices technologies key 
components a smart electrical grid 
security is a critical issue in smart 
grids, involve critical 
power facilities millions 
interconnected electronic devices 
you see screen, 
a grid renewable energy resources, 
transmission lines, distribution centers, 
service providers, smart electricity 
consumers forms a smart grid 
in order to provide a service, 
information is collected communicated 
between components 
a distributed hierarchical network 
reliability, safety, 
usability services 
highly dependent security 
smart grid networks 
based features, smart grid is 
vulnerable to different kinds attacks 
next, common 
attack types introduced 
like many networks 
also smart grid 
suffers denial service attacks 
attacks target different 
layers smart grid network 
in different ways 
in physical layer, channel jamming 
is common attack type, 
especially in wireless communication 
since easier an attacker to 
intercept wireless communication channels 
authenticated networks 
in media access control 
a mac layer, spoofing mac parameters, 
an attacker a better chance 
to access network in 
order to reduce performance 
shared communication channels, 
compromise availability 
integrity system 
in network 
transport layers, denialofservice 
attacks reduce endtoend 
communication performance 
especially worm propagation 
traffic flooding in layers 
considerably reduce communication 
speed, thereby overall 
performance smart grid 
in application layer, an attacker 
targets machines resources, cpu 
io bandwidth exhausting resources 
smart devices computer systems 
in a smart grid, majority computing 
communication devices resource 
constrained, therefore, 
this kind attack is serious 
threatening a smart grid 
in addition to denial service attacks, 
may target availability, 
smart grids also vulnerable 
to attack types 
target integrity confidentiality 
customers information 
example, usage pricing 
information also power system values, 
device readings 
attacks complicated 
less brute force 
denial service attacks 
risks integrity attacks 
high real 
false data injection is an example 
an integrity attack, 
influences users suppliers 
in this type attack attacker 
compromises a number 
measuring devices to 
inject false information 
this attack a longterm 
heavy impact smart grid systems, 
resulting in a significant 
financial loss suppliers 
hand, attacks target 
confidentiality information 
meant to modify information, 

to gain knowledge 
sensitive information 
eavesdropping is one main 
attack types in this category 
targeted information is typically 
a customers account number 
electricity usage 
data security 
privacy a top concern in smart grids 
utilization cloud computing 
data storage 
processing caused even 
problems smart grids 
indeed, wide range large amount 
data originating multiple 
sources makes challenging to guarantee 
data security privacy in grid 
especially if data, either public 
private, multiple owners 
is probable that personally 
identifiable information 
will eventually passed 
revealed if handled carefully 
this naturally compromises 
privacy smart grid users 
similar privacy issues also present 
transforming data 
aggregating multiple owners 
system performance point view, 
enforcing security 
privacy measures leads to 
finer granularity data 
that is control information 
is embedded in data, 
this might cause unacceptable 
latencies in cases 
usercentric access 
control approaches provide flexibility 
users to control 
access to data, 
is stored in a shared environment 
in approaches, 
access control policies 
could set to change dynamically 
based external information, 
social media 
activities users 
dynamically changing 
access control policies 
impose a high cost in terms 
system complexity 
due to nature, data in 
smart grid needs to archived 
a long period time 
storing data a long time requires 
powerful cryptographic solutions, 
a computational 
ability to break cryptographic 
algorithms increase time 
in addition, users perception 
requirements 
privacy change time 
this in mind, system 
designed in a way 
that there is a built in tolerance 
changes in security 
privacy measures 
longterm archive data 
in this lesson, 
concludes module, 
introduction to cyberphysical systems, 
security, privacy, 
we looked security issues 
smart grid networks an example 
real world cyberphysical systems 
in next module, we going to 
learn cryptographic solutions
