hello, welcome back 
in this lesson, we will learn 
common attack models 
cyber physical systems 
mechanisms to mitigate attacks 
attacks cyber physical systems 
divided passive active attacks 
in an active attack, attacker 
manipulates system resources 
affects operation system 
active attacks carried 
within a short period time 
in a passive attack, attackers 
makes use information in 
system without 
interrupting operation 
passive attacks done 
a longer period time 
difficult to detect 
lets explore different 
attacks models in detail 
eavesdropping, 
sniffing is a passive attack 
in attacker captures 
information transmitted in a system 
attacker aims to obtain 
sensitive information, as, 
passwords, session tokens, 
kind confidential information 
eavesdropping, therefore, 
violates privacy users, 
effect 
operation system 
lets a closer look potential 
eavesdropping attacks 
cyber physical systems 
in a wireless communication, 
an attacker capture network 
packets receiver 
if communication is encrypted, 
attacker try to break 
encryption to gain information 
in physical wired links, 
eavesdropping could done analyzing 
electromagnetic fields wires 
in addition to wires, 
devices displays also 
electromagnetic emissions 
that could analyzed 
to get information 
power analysis is 
way eavesdropping, 
in attacker attempts 
to capture information 
analyzing electrical 
power usage a system 
now, that we got familiar 
different types eavesdropping 
lets see we mitigate this attack 
eavesdropping prevented 
using strong encryption 
this is important, 
especially in wireless communications 
using smart antennas to limit coverage 
area wireless access points 
using minimal power 
wireless transmissions 
ways mitigating 
this attack in wireless network 
physical protection cyber 
physical systems is also 
important to mitigate 
eavesdropping attacks 
example, using shielded wires 
physical links using special racks 
rooms critical devices 
methods physical protection 
denial service, dos, 
is another common attack model 
a dos attack is an active attack in 
attacker targets availability 
service system 
temporarily indefinitely 
a dos attack 
a devastating effect system 
dos attacks carried 
exhausting systems 
resources a lot valid processes 
in words, 
dos attacks take advantage valid 
actions in a system repeating 
actions a huge number times in a row 
example, in icmp internet 
control message protocol flood attack 
attacker floods server 
several icmp echo requests 
ping packets 
in this case, server will 
busy to respond to ping requests 
this will result in a significant 
decrease in ability to process 
respond to main services 
main objectives 
denialof serviceattacks are, 
congesting network resources, 
draining cpu memory, 
reducing computing power, 
exploiting tcp timers 
poisoning domain name translations 
to make a dos attack even efficient, 
multiple computers attack a single 
device server simultaneously 
this mechanism is called a distributed 
denial service attack ddos 
ddos is a multi person, 
multi device attack that is launched 
multiple sources that 
distributed network 
ddos attacks, dangerous attacks, 
difficult to track prevent 
syn flood attack is 
an example a ddos attack 
in a syn flood attack, 
a device servers attacked 
a flat tcpc synchronization 
packets multiple sources 
in cases, to make difficult 
to detect source attack, 
attackers use full source 
acronises in scene pockets 
lowrate tcp targeted attack 
is another mechanism dos 
exploits properties 
tcp timers 
results in degrading throughput 
a system close to zero 
in order to make a denialof service 
attack difficult to trace, 
an intermediate host used 
launching attack 
this approach is called 
reflective dos attack 
a botnet attack is an example 
a reflective dos attack 
a compromisedkey attack is another 
attack model cyber physical systems 
a compromisedkey refers to a secret 
code obtained an attacker 
to interpret secure information 
key could a password 
logging a system 
a session key 
communication between two devices 
if a key is obtained an attacker, 
is considered a compromisedkey 
in this attack, sender receiver 
usually aware attack 
hence, is considered a passive attack 
so cyber physical systems 
vulnerable to compromisedkey attacks 
vulnerability cyber physical 
systems to compromisekey attacks 
is based special 
characteristics systems 
cyber physical systems 
physically accessible, 
therefore easier to compromise 
example, an attacker could 
physically access a device 
obtain a password a secret key 
another reason is that due to resource 
constrained devices used in a cyber 
physical system, 
weaker security measures implemented 
devices communication 
weak measures easier to compromise 
a compromisedkey attack 
mitigated in several ways 
first, system 
protected physical attacks, 
unauthorized access to devices, 
physical links limited 
tamper proof hardware use 
in critical devices to prevent 
an attacker compromising in 
case gains physical access to 
also, encryption keys 
key life cycle management 
necessary to protect keys 
maninthemiddle is another common 
attack model cyber physical systems 
in this type attack, 
an adversary intercepts 
communication between two parties, 
captures original messages, passes 
altered messages between parties 
attacker impersonates parties 
controls communication 
can, example, get an original 
message, change parameters, 
send manipulated 
message to receiver 
this is an active attack type 
affects behavior system 
to mitigate maninthemiddle attacks, 
secure communication protocols 
used to prevent attacker 
tampering messages 
we will look subscript graphic 
solutions in later video lectures

different attack models
