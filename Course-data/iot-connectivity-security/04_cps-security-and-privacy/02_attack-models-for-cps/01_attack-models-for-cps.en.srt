>> Hello, welcome back.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,510
In this lesson, we will learn
about the common attack models for

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,050
cyber physical systems and
the mechanisms to mitigate these attacks.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,900
Attacks on cyber physical systems are
divided into passive and active attacks.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,340
In an active Attack, the attacker
manipulates the system resources and

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,320
affects the operation of the system.

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,350
Active attacks are carried out
within a short period of time.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,225
In a passive Attack, the attackers
makes use of the information in

9
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:45,023
the system without
interrupting it's operation.

10
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:49,857
The passive attacks are done
over a longer period of time and

11
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,380
are more difficult to detect.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,770
Let's explore different
attacks models in more detail.

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,610
Eavesdropping, or
Sniffing is a Passive attack

14
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,890
in which the attacker captures
information transmitted in a system.

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,050
The attacker aims to obtain
sensitive information, such as,

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,780
passwords, session tokens, or
any kind of confidential information.

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,210
Eavesdropping, therefore,
violates the privacy of users,

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,500
but it does not effect
the operation of the system.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,371
Let's have a closer look at potential

20
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:41,112
Eavesdropping attacks against
cyber physical systems.

21
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:43,486
In a wireless communication,

22
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:48,150
an attacker can capture network
packets with the receiver.

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,270
If the communication is encrypted,

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,180
the attacker then try to break
the encryption to gain the information.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,430
In physical or wired links,

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,490
Eavesdropping could be done by analyzing
the Electromagnetic fields of the wires.

27
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,020
In addition to wires,

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,510
other devices such as displays also
have Electromagnetic emissions.

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,200
That could be analyzed
to get some information.

30
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:23,041
Power analysis is some
other way of Eavesdropping,

31
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,871
in which the attacker attempts
to capture some information

32
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,036
by analyzing the electrical
power usage of a system

33
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,370
Now, that we got familiar with
different types of Eavesdropping.

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,930
Let's see how we can mitigate this attack.

35
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,140
Eavesdropping can be prevented
by using strong encryption.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,279
This is very important,
especially in wireless communications.

37
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,721
Using smart antennas to limit the coverage
area of wireless access points and

38
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:04,135
using minimal power for
wireless transmissions

39
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:08,561
are other ways of mitigating
this attack in wireless network.

40
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:15,318
Physical protection of cyber
physical systems is also very

41
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,560
important to mitigate
eavesdropping attacks.

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,023
For example, using shielded wires for
physical links and using special racks or

43
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:29,774
rooms for critical devices are some
methods of physical protection.

44
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:38,940
Denial of Service, or (DoS),
is another common attack model.

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,840
A DoS attack is an Active attack in which

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,300
the attacker Targets the availability
of the service or system.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,320
Temporarily or indefinitely.

48
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,594
A DoS attack can have
a devastating effect on the system.

49
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,340
DoS attacks are carried out
by exhausting the systems

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,100
resources with a lot of valid processes.

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,340
In other words,
DoS attacks take advantage of valid

52
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,410
actions in a system by repeating those
actions a huge number of times in a row.

53
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:24,192
For example, in ICMP or internet
control message protocol flood attack.

54
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:30,158
The attacker floods the server
with several ICMP echo requests or

55
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,570
ping packets.

56
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,783
In this case, the server will be
busy to respond to ping requests and

57
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:42,798
this will result in a significant
decrease in its ability to process and

58
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,991
respond to its main services.

59
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:53,820
The main objectives of
Denial-of Service-attacks are,

60
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,272
Congesting network resources,
Draining CPU memory,

61
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:04,492
Reducing computing power,
Exploiting TCP timers Or

62
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:08,330
Poisoning domain name translations.

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,480
To make a DoS attack even more efficient,

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,880
multiple computers can attack on a single
device or server simultaneously.

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,539
This mechanism is called a Distributed
Denial of Service attack or DDoS.

66
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,123
DDoS is a multi person,
multi device attack that is launched

67
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:34,340
from multiple sources that
are distributed over the network.

68
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,955
DDoS attacks, the most dangerous attacks,
and are difficult to track and prevent.

69
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:46,970
SYN flood attack is
an example of a DDoS attack.

70
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,410
In a SYN flood attack,
a device or servers attacked

71
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,900
with a flat of TCPC synchronization
packets from multiple sources.

72
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,312
In most cases, to make it difficult
to detect the source of attack,

73
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:06,110
the attackers use full source
Acronises in the scene pockets.

74
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:14,680
Low-rate TCP targeted attack
is another mechanism for DoS.

75
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,940
It exploits the properties
of TCP timers and

76
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,090
results in degrading the throughput
of a system close to zero.

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,660
In order to make a Denial-of Service
attack more difficult to trace,

78
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,760
an intermediate host can be used for
launching the attack.

79
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
This approach is called
Reflective DoS attack.

80
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,010
A Botnet attack is an example
of a Reflective Dos attack.

81
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,439
A compromised-key Attack is another
attack model for cyber physical systems.

82
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,380
A compromised-key refers to a secret
code obtained by an attacker

83
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,490
to interpret secure information.

84
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,010
The key could be a password for
logging into a system or

85
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,560
a session key for
communication between two devices.

86
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,095
If a key is obtained by an attacker,
it is considered a Compromised-key.

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,281
In this attack, the sender and receiver
usually are not aware of the attack.

88
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,262
Hence, it is considered a passive attack.

89
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:32,167
So why are cyber physical systems
vulnerable to Compromised-key Attacks?

90
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:40,213
The vulnerability of cyber physical
systems to Compromise-key Attacks

91
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:44,297
is based on the special
characteristics of these systems.

92
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,590
Cyber physical systems
are Physically accessible,

93
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,340
and therefore easier to compromise.

94
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,620
For example, an attacker could
Physically access a device and

95
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,870
obtain a password or a secret key.

96
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Another reason is that due to the Resource
constrained devices used in a cyber

97
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,010
physical system,
weaker security measures are implemented.

98
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,870
For devices and communication.

99
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,319
Weak measures are easier to Compromise.

100
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:25,190
A Compromised-key Attack can
be mitigated in several ways.

101
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,470
First, the system should be
protected from Physical attacks,

102
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,430
unauthorized access to the devices,
and Physical links should be limited.

103
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,210
Tamper proof hardware can be use
in critical devices to prevent

104
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,149
an attacker from compromising them in
case he gains Physical access to them.

105
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,302
Also, Encryption of the keys and

106
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:54,676
Key life cycle management
are necessary to protect the keys.

107
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:02,980
Man-in-the-Middle is another common
Attack model cyber physical systems.

108
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,295
In this type of Attack,

109
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:10,120
an adversary intercepts
communication between two parties,

110
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,040
captures original messages, and passes
altered messages between the parties.

111
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,470
The attacker impersonates both parties and
controls communication.

112
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,980
He can, for example, get an original
message, change some parameters,

113
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,340
and then send the manipulated
message to the receiver.

114
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,095
This is an active attack type because
it affects the behavior of the system.

115
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:44,655
To mitigate the Man-in-the-Middle Attacks,
secure communication protocols

116
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:49,805
should be used to prevent the attacker
from tampering the messages.

117
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,889
We will look into subscript of graphic
solutions in later video lectures.

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
In this lesson, we learned about
different attack models for

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,330
cyber physical systems and also
discussed how to mitigate these attacks.

120
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,502
In the next video lecture,
we will look into security issues for

121
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,247
real world cyber physical system.

122
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:09,747
