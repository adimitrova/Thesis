sound welcome back to video 
lectures web connectivity 
security in cyberphysical systems 
in this lecture, well go 
basics internet 
web connectivity, including 
background information internet 
nuts bolts operation, 
especially internet protocol suite 
basic communication 
protocol internet 
layer design will discussed 
lets start internet 
a group connected 
computers is a network 
a group connected networks 
a large scale became internet 
one way understanding new 
technology is to look origins, 
developed 
this is a technique well 
also use in later videos 
we learn different protocols 
so to understand there is a huge 
network connected computers, 
lets look history 
internet came 
desire to a robust, 
faulttolerant network computers 
there two key takeaways here 
first, network to robust 
full tolerant, second, 
computers 
we see in modern internet 
we a pocket base network 
pocket take a different route 
to destination 
effect designed 
computers 
is that essentially we would 
call lightweight power efficient 
take example ethernet, designed 
computers a time 
power a requirement 
is one power hungry 
connectivity technologies 
cyberphysical systems ones 
that we will discuss in this course 
we moving 
an internet connected computers 
to an internet connected devices 
things 
this requires new technologies 
changes to current ones to suit 
needs new breed systems 
internet is network computers, 

actually carries information 
top this network 
one ways to carry 
display information this network, 
here we mean internet, 
is world wide web 
world wide web is a way to organize 
present information people 
this is a common distinction that 
many us generally get wrong 
internet connectivity means becoming 
a part this large worldwide network 
web connectivity, hand, 
means leveraging web 
technologies to share 
information this network 
heart web 
technologies hypertext, 
hypertext transfer protocol 
http, a web server, a browser 
we need internet connectivity 
web technologies to work, 
therefore, we will talk 
technologies that enable us to connect 
cyberphysical systems to internet 
technologies that enable us 
to access share web 
here is a short overview web 
internet 
internet enables existence 
world wide web 
world wide web facilitates interaction 
information sharing internet 
if internet is a highway, 
web is moving cars 
lets continue a bit analogy 
internet a highway 
web moving cars 
there one 
type cars moving highway 
example, there buses, 
trucks, vans, motor bikes 
likewise, there is 
web traffic internet 
there is email, usenet, file transfer 
protocol, peertopeer sharing, so 
enables 
to share network 
technology that enables different 
types traffic to share 
go network is tcpip 
transmission control 
protocolinternet protocol, 
commonly known 
internet protocol suite 
a protocol is a set rules methods 
you think 
grammar a spoken language 
rules 
methods facilitates a standard way 
communicating interacting 
tcpip protocol suite is 
therefore a set standards 
methods that allow different devices 
systems to communicate internet 
standard, doesnt 
matter system, operating system, 
application you 
long say, 
speak tcpip language, 
communicate 
others internet 
tcpip is divided layers 
simplicity understanding 
there multiple technologies that 
make tcpip, classification 
layers makes easy to 
comprehend this inherent diversity 
also enables decoupling 
one technology another 
imagine a wine glass 
a detachable base body 
you could change base depending 
surface youll using 
if you need grip, you would use rigid base 
while body would remain 
if you want to taste 
different kinds wine, 
you change body top 
in way tcpip layers 
you go top to bottom, 
you decide technology 
to use layers, 
technology that best suits needs 
if you develop technology, 
you place in appropriate 
layers others to use 
there four layers in tcpip model, 
application, transport, 
internet, link 
we will discuss next 
here is an overview 
layers functions 
we will discuss protocols 
layers, 
specifications in detail later 
topmost layer is 
application layer 
if you designing 
a protocol that allows 
different applications to communicate, 
will placed this layer 
we talking specific 
application software 
methods that 
application software will 
use to communicate another 
application software network 
an example is one chat client sending 
a message to another chat client 
if clients use 
chatting protocol xmpp, 
doesnt matter designed chat 
client platform is running 
will able to send 
receive messages 
here, application 
layer protocol is xmpp 
layer beneath application 
layer is transport layer 
purpose is to establish hosttohost 
communication one device to another 
receives data application 
layer, doesnt care this data is, 
transmits data to another 
process another host computer 
imagine you three browsers, 
chrome, firefox, internet explorer 
first one you entered google, 
second one you entered yahoo, 
bing third one 
in this case, you send three http requests 
three separate applications 
http is an application layer protocol 
responses 
requests appropriately 
provided to application 
chrome gets google page, 
firefox gets yahoo page, 
internet explorer gets bing page 
now, send similar requests, 
data didnt get mixed 

transport layer, provides 
data to application layer, 
is responsible ensuring that 
process receives intended 
moreover, this layer is responsible 
reliability, congestion control, 
multiplexing 
internet layer, is 
next lower layer, source 
destination addresses attached to 
packets coming higher layers 
this layer is responsible 
addressing routing 
also, a packet is received, 
is internet layers 
responsibility to forward to 
appropriate transport layer protocol 
link layer bottom 
protocol stack specifies standards 
methods that handle physical link 
protocols reside local link, 
meaning that limited to 
scope local network 
example, arp, 
address resolution protocol, is 
used to figure physical address, 
that is media access control 
mac address an internet 
protocol ip address 
this is computer knows 
local device an ip packet 
forwarded to 
a distinction to make here is that you 
need a mac address to send data in 
a local network an ip address 
to send data across networks 
sending data across networks is 
an internet layer operation, 
sending data within local 
network is a blink layer operation 
tcpip link layer 
doesnt assume anything 
type physical medium 
issues 
assumes that an underlying 
physical link exists 
therefore, link layer represents 
media access protocol, 
including wireless protocols 
wifi, gsm, bluetooth 
here example protocols 
layer 
a recap, in this lesson, we looked 
internet, world wide web, 
basics tcpip model 
in later videos, we will a 
detailed look different layers 
respective protocols 
music
