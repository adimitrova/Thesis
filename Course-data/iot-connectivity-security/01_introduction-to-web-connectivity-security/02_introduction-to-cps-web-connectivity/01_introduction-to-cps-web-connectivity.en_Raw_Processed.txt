welcome to web connectivity 
security course 
in this course we will study different web 
connectivity standards, solutions, 
protocols 
we will also study need 
security well protocols, 
methodologies solutions that will 
help you mitigate security risks 
talking web connectivity 
in cyberphysical systems, first 
question that arises is, bother 
connecting embedded systems 
if there is a device that controls 
settings microwave oven, 
need to 
talk to devices 
this is a valid point 
standalone embedded systems exist 
cater to a specific problem 
in case a microwave oven 
another example is an image 
processor in a digital camera 
whose purpose is handling light 
capture sensor 
to digitize, process, 
store that information an image 
performs that specific job 
well 
reality is that devices 
getting complex 
that connection is needed 
digital camera wifi 
gps modules 
to offer seamless transfer photos 
a geopack 
wifi gps modules 
baseline processors 
to work seamlessly, 
you to bring together 
you to connect 
reasonably modern car 
to onboard processors 
a modern series bmw 
to a hundred processors 
control different 
functions car 
example gps navigation, entertainment, 
parking distance control, 
radar cruise control, so 
to make car really function 
provides a safer journey, processors 
to communicate 
a classic example is that a car crash 
in case a crash, car will open 
door locks deploy air bag 
may perform emergency 
functions like flashing headlights 
,and sending location 
coordinates to an emergency service 
this is possible 
incar network 
if you think this is much, 
nvidia announced car computation 
platform that a combined 
performance teraflops 
to put this in perspective, 
worlds thranked 
super computer in 
a computational power 
teraflops 
that one , processor cores 
so, soon car will 
computation 
capability super computers in 
here we discuss 
selfcontained local networks within cars 
soon cars will able to communicate 
cars road 
traffic monitoring systems 
thus, future is connected 
connectivity is optional anymore, 
fundamental 
establishing case 
connectivity in cyberphysical 
embedded systems, next question would 
we need web connectivity 
here we need to a deeper look 
lets first look 
benefits web connectivity 
first 
foremost benefit is ubiquity 
web is everywhere, pc, 
to phones, to even smart watches 
you access world wide 
web smartphones 
also dumb phones a decade ago 
you need is a browser 
a browser like opera mini that 
even bundled embedded systems 
scalability is another important point 
world wide web is 
already quite large 
accommodate even 
sources information users 
web technologies automatically scale, 
based demand, 
minimal user intervention 
scale to user needs, 
computational load, 
network requirements 
world wide web us 
well two decades 
that is enough time to test 
optimize webenabling technologies, 
html, http, 
web servers fully understood 
there highly optimized web servers 
available small sensors that take 
less seven kilobytes space, 
is an efficient use memory 
one main features web 
technologies is that dont care 
underlying architecture 
technologies 
one websupported device communicate 
effectively another one, 
irrespective system 
communication infrastructure used 
lastly, major future technologies 
will reside web 
heavily utilize current 
internet technologies 
lets take cloud computing 
you provided ondemand 
computational power services 
you use services 
big data analytics 
utilize data insights 
better decisionmaking 
imagine gathering data 
hundreds thousands sensors, 
transferring this data to cloud 
storage processing, 
afterwards relaying this decision back 
to nodes an actuator to activate 
despite benefits web connectivity, 
also comes a cost 
web connectivity, you get to leverage 
cloud computing infrastructure, 
remote monitoring assessment 
well remote command control 
however, first thing 
people involved design 
development connected embedded 
systems is an increase in complexity 
compared to a stand alone setup, 
a network connected system requires 
extra effort in network design 
connectivity solutions, 
in hardware software design 
to enable that connectivity 
in later videos well discuss 
choices you 
comes to network connectivity 
moreover, web connectivity you 
inherit security issues well 
you connect cyberphysical 
systems internet, 
you open to roughly 
level security weaknesses 
attacks in 
internetconnected networks 
security cant an afterthought anymore 
if you building a connected system, 
security an inherent 
feature right beginning 
in case car example, you 
a network limited to cars internals 
so, locking door 
will effectively lock 
thieves accessing 
computer systems 
you connect 
that car to internet, 
you cant rely locking doors 
you opened car to attacks 
anywhere in world 
assured, 
we technologies, protocols, 
solutions that will help 
mitigate threats 
well discuss in later videos 
lastly web connectivity 
is resource heavy 
really small low power devices, 
memory computational power 
a limited resource, connectivity 
puts an extra burden resources 
depending upon connectivity solutions, 
solutions that you choose, 
you will to add 
extra hardware 
software layers to communicate that 
takes memory processing power 
solutions 
resource hungry others 
we will discuss that later 
nonetheless, 
connectivity adds an extra cost 
additionally, if you decide to 
add security, you should, 
youll need sort cryptographic 
algorithm to secure data 
cryptographic computations 
processorintensive, 
meaning that put a lot 
strain processor 
this drive energy 
consumption well 
lets discuss connectivity 
in cyberphysical systems 
in a general context 
course, nice to an overview 
home you vacation 
remote start car in a freezing 
weather so, warm you get inside 
to able to assess whats 
wrong in production plant 
without physically there 
but, you will come across situations 
you wont need web connectivity 
daily life example, 
you really need to connect 
standalone coffee machine to wifi 
course you might think, 
a coffee machine 
go wrong if 
hackers get access to 
boil coffee to 
give a bitter taste 
thing is that coffee 
machine if security is weak, 
hackers will get access 
to network 
there go to system 
anywhere 
in this case, coffee machine 
is target but, 
another attack vector system 
so, yes, there benefits to web 
connectivity there downsides 
you will need to is assess whether 
you really need web connectivity 
you decide former, 
youll need a proper implementation 
that is this course will help you 
end, youll 
informed protocols 
solutions available to you 
you will able to make informed 
decisions comes to adding 
connectivity to embedded solutions
