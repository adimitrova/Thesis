1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to the web connectivity and
security course.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,950
In this course we will study different web
connectivity standards, solutions, and

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,410
protocols.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,960
We will also study the need for
security as well as protocols,

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,389
methodologies and solutions that will
help you mitigate security risks.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,280
Before talking about web connectivity
in cyber-physical systems, the first

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,110
question that arises is, why then bother
connecting your embedded systems?

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,440
If there is a device that controls
the settings on my microwave oven,

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,330
what need does it have to
talk to other devices?

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,670
This is a valid point.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,410
Standalone embedded systems do exist and

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,762
cater to a specific problem as
in the case of a microwave oven.

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,510
Another example is an image
processor in a digital camera.

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,190
Whose purpose is handling the light
capture from the sensor and

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,120
to digitize, process, and
store that information as an image.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,200
It performs that specific job and
does it very well.

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,720
The reality is that devices
are getting more and more complex and

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
that connection is needed.

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,430
The same digital camera now has wi-fi and
GPS modules

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,827
to offer seamless transfer of photos and
a geopack then.

21
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:40,300
These wi-fi and GPS modules have
their own baseline processors

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,430
and for all of them to work seamlessly,
you have to bring them together.

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,122
You have to connect them.

24
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:54,676
Any reasonably modern car can
have 25 to 50 onboard processors.

25
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:59,549
A modern 7-Series BMW has
up to a hundred processors.

26
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,000
All of these control different
functions of the car.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,310
For example GPS navigation, entertainment,

28
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,840
parking distance control,
radar cruise control, and so on.

29
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,830
To make the car really function and

30
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,160
provides a safer journey, the processors
have to communicate with each other.

31
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,460
A classic example is that of a car crash.

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,610
In case of a crash, your car will open
the door locks and deploy the air bag.

33
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,225
It may perform other emergency
functions like flashing the headlights

34
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,830
,and sending your location
coordinates to an emergency service.

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,400
All of this is possible
because of the in-car network.

36
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,580
If you think this is too much,
NVIDIA announced car computation

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,070
platform that has a combined
performance of 8 teraflops.

38
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,515
To put this in perspective,
the world's 418th-ranked

39
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:08,028
super computer in 2008 had
a computational power of 9.1

40
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:13,030
teraflops and
that one had 4,096 processor cores.

41
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,720
So, soon your car will have
the same computation or

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,790
capability as the super computers in 2008.

43
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,690
And here we only discuss the
self-contained local networks within cars.

44
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,940
Soon cars will be able to communicate
with other cars on the road and

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,810
with the traffic monitoring systems.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,740
Thus, the future is connected and

47
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,270
connectivity is not optional anymore,
it's fundamental.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,700
After establishing the case for
connectivity in cyber-physical or

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,890
embedded systems, the next question would
be why do we need web connectivity?

50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,900
Here we need to have a deeper look.

51
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,620
Let's first look into
the benefits of web connectivity.

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,780
The first and
foremost benefit is ubiquity.

53
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,570
The web is everywhere, from your PC,
to phones, to even smart watches.

54
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,200
You can access the world wide
web not only on smartphones but

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
also on dumb phones from a decade ago.

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,650
All you need is a browser.

57
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,300
A browser like Opera Mini that can
even be bundled into embedded systems.

58
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,760
Scalability is another important point.

59
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,010
The World Wide Web is
already quite large and

60
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,799
it can accommodate even more
sources of information and users.

61
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,740
Web technologies can automatically scale,

62
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,000
based on demand,
with minimal user intervention.

63
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,760
They can scale to user needs,
computational load, or

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,170
network requirements.

65
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,890
The World Wide Web has been with us for
well more than two decades now.

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,240
That is enough time to test and
optimize the web-enabling technologies,

67
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,710
HTML, http, and
web servers are fully understood.

68
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,978
There are highly optimized web servers
available for small sensors that take

69
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:29,655
less than seven kilobytes of space,
which is an efficient use of memory.

70
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,949
One of the main features of web
technologies is that they don't care about

71
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,810
the underlying architecture or
technologies.

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,375
One web-supported device can communicate
effectively with another one,

73
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,539
irrespective of the system and
communication infrastructure used.

74
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,810
Lastly, major future technologies
will reside on the web or

75
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,810
heavily utilize the current
internet technologies.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,362
Let's take cloud computing where
you are provided with on-demand

77
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,930
computational power and services.

78
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,980
You can use these services for
big data analytics and

79
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,665
then utilize these data insights for
better decision-making.

80
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:23,160
Imagine gathering data from
hundreds of thousands of sensors,

81
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,790
then transferring this data to the cloud
for storage and processing, and

82
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:34,170
afterwards relaying this decision back
to the nodes or an actuator to activate.

83
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,500
Despite the benefits of web connectivity,
it also comes at a cost.

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,970
With web connectivity, you get to leverage
the cloud computing infrastructure,

85
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,620
remote monitoring and assessment as
well as remote command and control.

86
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,100
However, the very first thing for
people involved with design and

87
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,380
development of connected embedded
systems is an increase in complexity.

88
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,350
Compared to a stand alone setup,
a network connected system requires

89
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,730
extra effort In network design and
connectivity solutions,

90
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,910
and in hardware and software design
to enable that connectivity.

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,500
In later videos we'll discuss
more on the choices you have

92
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,440
when it comes to network connectivity.

93
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,030
Moreover, with web connectivity you
inherit its security issues as well.

94
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:41,750
When you connect your cyber-physical
systems through the internet,

95
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,600
you open then to roughly the same
level of security weaknesses and

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,370
attacks as in other
Internet-connected networks.

97
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,890
Security can't be an afterthought anymore.

98
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,980
If you are building a connected system,

99
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,980
security should be an inherent
feature right from the beginning.

100
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:11,470
In case of the car example, you have
a network limited to the car's internals.

101
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,860
So, locking the door
will effectively lock out

102
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,680
most thieves from accessing
the computer systems.

103
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,840
But when you connect
that car to the internet,

104
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,040
you can't rely on locking the doors only.

105
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,480
You have opened the car to attacks
from anywhere in the world.

106
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,900
But be assured,
we have technologies, protocols, and

107
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,090
solutions that will help
mitigate these threats.

108
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,290
And we'll discuss them in later videos.

109
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,560
And lastly web connectivity
is resource heavy.

110
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,890
For really small low power devices,
memory and computational power

111
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,969
are a limited resource, connectivity
puts an extra burden on these resources.

112
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,960
Depending upon the connectivity solutions,
solutions that you choose,

113
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,700
you will have to add
the extra hardware and

114
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,430
software layers to communicate and that
takes both memory and processing power.

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,540
Some solutions are more
resource hungry than others and

116
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,740
we will discuss that further later on.

117
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,620
But nonetheless,
connectivity adds an extra cost.

118
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,880
Additionally, if you decide to
add security, which you should,

119
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,480
you'll need some sort of cryptographic
algorithm to secure your data.

120
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,888
Cryptographic computations
are processor-intensive,

121
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,580
meaning that they put a lot
of strain on the processor.

122
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,054
This can drive up the energy
consumption as well.

123
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:04,170
Let's discuss connectivity
in cyber-physical systems

124
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,610
in a general context.

125
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,260
Of course, it's nice to have an overview
of your home when you are on vacation or

126
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,420
remote start your car in a freezing
weather so, it's warm when you get inside.

127
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,030
Or to be able to assess what's
wrong in the production plant

128
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,300
without physically being there.

129
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,330
But, you will come across situations
where you won't need web connectivity.

130
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,640
For our very daily life for example,

131
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,980
do you really need to connect your
stand-alone coffee machine to your wi-fi?

132
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,380
Of course you might think,
it's just a coffee machine.

133
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,120
What can go wrong if
hackers get access to it?

134
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,840
Over boil my coffee to
give it a bitter taste?

135
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,530
The thing is that through your coffee
machine if its security is weak,

136
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,170
hackers will get access
to your network and

137
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,100
from there they can go to your system or
anywhere.

138
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,610
In this case, the coffee machine
is not the target itself but,

139
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,210
another attack vector against your system.

140
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,755
So, yes, there are benefits to web
connectivity and there are the downsides.

141
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,630
What you will need to do is assess whether
you really need web connectivity or not.

142
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,790
Once you decide on the former,
you'll need a proper implementation.

143
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,650
That is where this course will help you.

144
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,240
By the end, you'll be more
informed about the protocols and

145
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,720
solutions available to you.

146
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,216
And you will be able to make informed
decisions when it comes to adding

147
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:47,095
connectivity to your embedded solutions.

148
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:51,059
