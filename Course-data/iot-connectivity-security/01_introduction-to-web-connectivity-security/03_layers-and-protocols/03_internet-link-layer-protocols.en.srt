2
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:10,050
Welcome to the final lesson on
the basics of TCP IP suite.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,720
So far we have looked into protocols that
help applications understand each other

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,980
and protocols that help applications
build a communication link.

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,630
Tn this video lecture,
we will look at the TCP IP layers and

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,400
protocols that helps devices or
machines connect and exchange package.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,800
We will look at how you get the data
that applications have generated and

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,590
take it out of the local machine and carry
it over the network to another device.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,400
This is where the Internet, or
network layer and link layer come in.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,940
First, the Internet layer.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,370
This layer is responsible for
addressing, routing,

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,140
error handling, and of course, managing
data flow to the layer beneath it.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,690
The IP part in TCP/IP means the Internet
Protocol which operates on this layer.

14
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,640
We will look in to
the Internet Protocol and

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,010
see how it offers the functions that
the internet layer is supposed to provide.

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,390
So, IP stands for the Internet Protocol.

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,688
And it's the protocol that
everyone in the TCP IP suite

18
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,900
relies on to transmit data
packets over the network.

19
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,490
No matter what transport layer
protocol you use, whether TCP or

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,140
UDP The data eventually is handled by IP.

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,830
Like UDP,
it is a connection-less protocol meaning

22
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,190
each data packet is considered unique and
there is no context maintained.

23
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,800
Sending the current packet has no
relation to the previous or next packet.

24
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,560
It's not a reliable transport mechanism.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,980
There is no guarantee that the packet
will be successfully delivered.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,440
As there is no link establishment
in advance and no assured delivery,

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,499
the packet can take any path over
the network to reach a destination.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,090
This helps against link failures.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,026
If a router or a physical link goes down,

30
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,599
the back end just takes
an alternative path.

31
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:40,850
The Internet Protocol is
available in two versions.

32
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,460
IPV version 4 or IPv4.

33
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,570
And IP version 6 or IPv6.

34
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,600
Both offer the same service, but
in a slightly different way.

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,410
The very basic difference
between them is addressing.

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,260
We will look into this later on.

37
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,530
IP is also responsible for routing,
meaning finding a path for

38
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,790
a packet to move around the networks
until it reaches the destination.

39
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,450
If the receiving node is on the same
network, the packet is delivered directly.

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,140
This is called local delivery.

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,670
If the receiver is on another network,

42
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,520
then the protocol delivers the message
to a device called a router.

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,720
If the receiver is connected to
the router the message is passed to it.

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,930
Otherwise, it is sent to the next
router and then to the next and so on.

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,240
A jump from one router to
another is called a hop.

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,540
It is theorized that you can reach
anywhere on the internet with a maximum

47
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,559
of 64 hops, and reach more than
99% of the internet using 32 hops.

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,300
Some protocols might have
their own limitations.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,790
For example, the routing information
protocol, or RIP, has a limit of 15 hops.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,656
Other routing protocols are, for example,

51
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:26,416
open shortest path first, or OSPF and
Border Gateway Protocol or BGP.

52
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:35,072
The Internet Control Message Protocol,
or ICMP, is used for

53
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:38,770
reporting errors in
the delivery of IP packets.

54
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,620
It is part of the IP Suite.

55
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,850
Think of it running in parallel
with the normal IP functions.

56
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,240
Imagine running two network
cables between the nodes A and

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,730
B, the first one carries data from A to B.

58
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,400
The second one carries
an error message from B to A.

59
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Only if the path between A and
B is blocked or unreachable.

60
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:15,420
In this example, the network cable between
A and B represents standard IP packets

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,450
and the network cable between B and
A carrying error messages represents ICMP.

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,790
Whenever an IP packet can't be delivered,
the router on that

63
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,670
point generates an ICMP packet,
and forwards it to the sender.

64
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,278
IP doesn't act on the error message, but
sends it to the transport layer protocol,

65
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:43,430
TCP or UDP.

66
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,770
And they can then decide whether to
retransmit the lost data or not.

67
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,980
Another important protocol
of the IP suite is IPSec.

68
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,259
IP Security is a set of protocols for
securing communication between devices.

69
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,310
Unlike, TOS and DTLS mentioned earlier,
this one operates in the internet layer.

70
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,770
It will be discussed further
later on in the course.

71
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,350
A little bit about the IP version 4.

72
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,430
This is the most common version
of the internet protocol.

73
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,440
The one you will most likely encounter.

74
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,480
It has a 32 bit address space and

75
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,000
can have 4.29 billion unique addresses.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,120
IPv4 address space is divided
into different portions,

77
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,019
each portion is reserved for
a special purpose.

78
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,920
Have you ever wondered why the default
IP address of every broadband router

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,213
that you buy is 1.92.168.01?

80
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:04,150
That's because the range is reserved for
private use.

81
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,460
To build your own home network for
example.

82
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,004
IPv4 addresses have a dotted
decimal notation and

83
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,816
example at risk is shown here.

84
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:25,003
IPv version 6 is the new version
of the internet protocol suite.

85
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:31,938
The basic attributes and
functionalities are the same as in IPv4.

86
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:37,230
But IPv6 has

87
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,610
a 128 bit address space instead of 32,
and twice the header size.

88
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,050
It's designed to replace IPv4.

89
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,460
One particular problem with IPv4
is that there are more devices

90
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,240
connected to the Internet then there are
available at vertices that you can assign.

91
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,000
With IPv4, that unit is 4.29 billion.

92
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,643
With IPv6, it is, well, try to count
the number of zeros on the screen.

93
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:19,295
With more and more smart devices
connected to the Internet,

94
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:24,940
reaching 50 billion by 2020
according to estimations.

95
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,530
You need a large address pool.

96
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,090
IPv6 provides you
the needed address space.

97
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,850
Here's an example of an IPv6 address.

98
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,409
Clearly it's not readable for human eyes
in the same way as the IPv4 address.

99
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,910
Here you see the difference
between the IPv4 and IPv6 headers.

100
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,920
The large address field of the IPv6
header is instantly noticeable.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,310
On the other hand the overall structure
of the IPv6 header is simpler.

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,980
In the IPv4 header,
the fields with great text,

103
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,630
the IPv4 attributes that
were not carried to IPv6.

104
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,690
Remember, IPv6 is
designed to replace IPv4.

105
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,980
They are not interoperable.

106
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,120
This ends our discussion
on the internet layer.

107
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,050
Now, we will have a quick layer of
the TCP-IP model, the link layer.

108
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,470
So far, we have seen how data moves
across programs and networks.

109
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,040
And now, we will look into how it goes
from one local network point to another.

110
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,650
The link layer is the lowest
layer in the TCPIP model.

111
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,320
It's responsible for
transmitting information from

112
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,060
one point in the local network to
another point in the same network.

113
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,710
So, in theory,
with the presence of this layer,

114
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,550
you would be able to create
a local area network.

115
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,240
Or be able to communicate locally even if
you don't implement the internet layer.

116
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,328
The link layer acts as an interface
between the lower physical hardware

117
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:27,580
implementation of the network and
the upper, more logical,

118
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,278
software-focused implementation
of the network.

119
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,202
The link layer has several functions.

120
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:42,030
First, it provides local addressing.

121
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,390
Let's look at ethernet,

122
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,579
a system of connecting computers
in a local area network.

123
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,040
Each ethernet adapter has a specific,

124
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,860
unique address assigned by
the manufacturer called a MAC Address.

125
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,040
A MAC Address is how a network adapter
knows who is who on the network.

126
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,360
The difference between a MAC address and
an IP address is that

127
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,650
MAC address are used for
identifying devices on the local network.

128
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,880
And IP address are used to identify
devices across networks even globally.

129
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:27,360
You can change your IP
address several times but

130
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,140
still the data packet intended for
your device reaches you, how?

131
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,190
Well, that's because of the MAC address.

132
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,920
A link layer protocol called ARP or
address resolution protocol,

133
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,619
has the job of identifying which IP
address corresponds to which MAC address.

134
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,910
So when you change your IP address,
ARP updates the local table and

135
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,890
puts the new address
against your MAC address.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,470
The link layer also provides
local error detection

137
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,889
of errors that could have been caused
by noise on the network channels.

138
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,203
The most common method is adding
cyclic redundancy check or CRC Codes.

139
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:25,617
When you take the data from
the upper layers add the local

140
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:30,537
MAC addresses of the destination
on yours add CRC codes for

141
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:37,710
error detection and any other fields
required by the local lead protocol.

142
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,480
This new packet of data is called a frame.

143
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,820
Frames are what you then send
over the physical medium.

144
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,380
Now, concerning the physical medium,

145
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,410
there needs to be a way to handle
communication on the local network.

146
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,680
To decide who has the right to use
the network cable for instance.

147
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
Who can talk and for how long.

148
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,100
And to assure there are no
collisions of signals.

149
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,019
All of this is called media
access control, or MAC.

150
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,590
Yes, this is where the name
MAC at risk comes from.

151
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,767
Media Access Control includes
different methods to ensure successful

152
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:27,411
communication, but these methods
are out of the scope of this lesson.

153
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:34,141
The actual transmission of the data
bits over the network takes

154
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:37,460
place in the form of signals.

155
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,670
Electrical signals in
the case of ethernet and

156
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,480
electromagnetic signals
in the case of WiFi.

157
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,385
This is not actually regulated or
described in the TCP/IP model.

158
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:55,310
The TCP/IP model doesn't care
about the physical characteristics

159
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,480
of the network technology.

160
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,280
This however does present
an interesting problem.

161
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,800
What about standards like WiFi that
define both a physical layer and

162
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,090
media access control.

163
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,070
Where would you put WiFi
in the TCPIP model?

164
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,120
Well As already stated in
another video lecture, for

165
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,980
the sake of simplicity we will put
all the machine to machine, or

166
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,390
M to M connectivity protocols like WiFi,
Bluetooth, and

167
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,823
ZigBee under the umbrella
of the link layer.

168
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:35,520
Here is an overview of what
we studied in this module.

169
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,820
To your left is the TCP/IP Layered model,
and

170
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,740
to the right are some of the associated
protocols at rest in the lectures.

171
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,400
I hope you have now a better understanding
of all these layers and an idea of

172
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,230
what the basic properties of a protocol
are when it belongs to a specific layer.

173
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,517
In the next module, we will have
a closer look at the protocols that we

174
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:08,401
sign on the application and link layers.

175
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:12,379
