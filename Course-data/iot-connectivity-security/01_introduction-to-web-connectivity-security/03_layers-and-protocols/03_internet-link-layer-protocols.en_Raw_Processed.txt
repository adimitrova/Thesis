welcome to final lesson 
basics tcp ip suite 
so far we looked protocols that 
help applications understand 
protocols that help applications 
build a communication link 
tn this video lecture, 
we will look tcp ip layers 
protocols that helps devices 
machines connect exchange package 
we will look you get data 
that applications generated 
take local machine carry 
network to another device 
this is internet, 
network layer link layer come in 
first, internet layer 
this layer is responsible 
addressing, routing, 
error handling, course, managing 
data flow to layer beneath 
ip part in tcpip means internet 
protocol operates this layer 
we will look in to 
internet protocol 
see offers functions that 
internet layer is supposed to provide 
so, ip stands internet protocol 
protocol that 
everyone in tcp ip suite 
relies to transmit data 
packets network 
matter transport layer 
protocol you use, whether tcp 
udp data eventually is handled ip 
like udp, 
is a connectionless protocol meaning 
data packet is considered unique 
there is context maintained 
sending current packet 
relation to previous next packet 
a reliable transport mechanism 
there is guarantee that packet 
will successfully delivered 
there is link establishment 
in advance assured delivery, 
packet take path 
network to reach a destination 
this helps link failures 
if a router a physical link goes down, 
back end takes 
an alternative path 
internet protocol is 
available in two versions 
ipv version ipv 
ip version ipv 
offer service, 
in a slightly different way 
basic difference 
between is addressing 
we will look this later 
ip is also responsible routing, 
meaning finding a path 
a packet to move around networks 
until reaches destination 
if receiving node is 
network, packet is delivered directly 
this is called local delivery 
if receiver is another network, 
protocol delivers message 
to a device called a router 
if receiver is connected to 
router message is passed to 
otherwise, is sent to next 
router to next so 
a jump one router to 
another is called a hop 
is theorized that you reach 
anywhere internet a maximum 
hops, reach 
internet using hops 
protocols might 
limitations 
example, routing information 
protocol, rip, a limit hops 
routing protocols are, example, 
open shortest path first, ospf 
border gateway protocol bgp 
internet control message protocol, 
icmp, is used 
reporting errors in 
delivery ip packets 
is part ip suite 
think running in parallel 
normal ip functions 
imagine running two network 
cables between nodes a 
b, first one carries data a to b 
second one carries 
an error message b to a 
if path between a 
b is blocked unreachable 
in this example, network cable between 
a b represents standard ip packets 
network cable between b 
a carrying error messages represents icmp 
whenever an ip packet cant delivered, 
router that 
point generates an icmp packet, 
forwards to sender 
ip doesnt act error message, 
sends to transport layer protocol, 
tcp udp 
decide whether to 
retransmit lost data 
another important protocol 
ip suite is ipsec 
ip security is a set protocols 
securing communication between devices 
unlike, tos dtls mentioned earlier, 
this one operates in internet layer 
will discussed 
later in course 
a little bit ip version 
this is common version 
internet protocol 
one you will likely encounter 
a bit address space 
billion unique addresses 
ipv address space is divided 
different portions, 
portion is reserved 
a special purpose 
you ever wondered default 
ip address every broadband router 
that you buy is 
thats range is reserved 
private use 
to build home network 
example 
ipv addresses a dotted 
decimal notation 
example risk is shown here 
ipv version is new version 
internet protocol suite 
basic attributes 
functionalities in ipv 
ipv 
a bit address space instead , 
twice header size 
designed to replace ipv 
one particular problem ipv 
is that there devices 
connected to internet there 
available vertices that you assign 
ipv, that unit is billion 
ipv, is, well, try to count 
number zeros screen 
smart devices 
connected to internet, 
reaching billion 
according to estimations 
you need a large address pool 
ipv provides you 
needed address space 
heres an example an ipv address 
clearly readable human eyes 
in way ipv address 
here you see difference 
between ipv ipv headers 
large address field ipv 
header is instantly noticeable 
hand overall structure 
ipv header is simpler 
in ipv header, 
fields great text, 
ipv attributes that 
carried to ipv 
remember, ipv is 
designed to replace ipv 
interoperable 
this ends discussion 
internet layer 
now, we will a quick layer 
tcpip model, link layer 
so far, we seen data moves 
across programs networks 
now, we will look goes 
one local network point to another 
link layer is lowest 
layer in tcpip model 
responsible 
transmitting information 
one point in local network to 
another point in network 
so, in theory, 
presence this layer, 
you would able to create 
a local area network 
able to communicate locally even if 
you dont implement internet layer 
link layer acts an interface 
between lower physical hardware 
implementation network 
upper, logical, 
softwarefocused implementation 
network 
link layer several functions 
first, provides local addressing 
lets look ethernet, 
a system connecting computers 
in a local area network 
ethernet adapter a specific, 
unique address assigned 
manufacturer called a mac address 
a mac address is a network adapter 
knows is network 
difference between a mac address 
an ip address is that 
mac address used 
identifying devices local network 
ip address used to identify 
devices across networks even globally 
you change ip 
address several times 
still data packet intended 
device reaches you, 
well, thats mac address 
a link layer protocol called arp 
address resolution protocol, 
job identifying ip 
address corresponds to mac address 
so you change ip address, 
arp updates local table 
puts new address 
mac address 
link layer also provides 
local error detection 
errors that could caused 
noise network channels 
common method is adding 
cyclic redundancy check crc codes 
you take data 
upper layers add local 
mac addresses destination 
add crc codes 
error detection fields 
required local lead protocol 
this new packet data is called a frame 
frames you send 
physical medium 
now, concerning physical medium, 
there needs to a way to handle 
communication local network 
to decide right to use 
network cable instance 
talk long 
to assure there 
collisions signals 
this is called media 
access control, mac 
yes, this is name 
mac risk comes 
media access control includes 
different methods to ensure successful 
communication, methods 
scope this lesson 
actual transmission data 
bits network takes 
place in form signals 
electrical signals in 
case ethernet 
electromagnetic signals 
in case wifi 
this is actually regulated 
described in tcpip model 
tcpip model doesnt care 
physical characteristics 
network technology 
this however present 
an interesting problem 
standards like wifi that 
define a physical layer 
media access control 
would you put wifi 
in tcpip model 
well already stated in 
another video lecture, 
sake simplicity we will put 
machine to machine, 
m to m connectivity protocols like wifi, 
bluetooth, 
zigbee umbrella 
link layer 
here is an overview 
we studied in this module 
to left is tcpip layered model, 

to right associated 
protocols rest in lectures 
i hope you a better understanding 
layers an idea 
basic properties a protocol 
belongs to a specific layer 
in next module, we will 
a closer look protocols that we 
sign application link layers
