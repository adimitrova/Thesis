welcome to lesson 
application layer protocols is 
part web connectivity 
segment course 
in previous video lecture i 
explained basic function 
application layer, is 
top layer in tcpip model 
in this lesson, we will look 
basics application layer protocols 
go protocols 
that enable world wide web 
lets start understanding 
network applications 
first foremost, applications 
that you use to networked 
this true previously, 
is gradually becoming uncommon 
applications that dont require 
data exchange network 
work called 
standalone applications 
example, many video image editors, 
word processors 
cap tools applications 
currently also applications 
becoming connected, 
there are, example, 
photo editing applications that allow 
you to share images internet 
soon we will probably 
standalone applications, 
except in critical security systems 
real time systems 
networked applications, 
unlike standalone applications, 
need to connect to 
applications network 
there applications 
that inherently networked, 
email, web browser 
ftp tools file transfer 
hand, 
there applications that we 
made connected utility 
a good example is a word 
processor lets you 
collaborate authors around 
globe simultaneously a shared document 
in order to communicate network, 
applications need to follow certain 
rules so that there is consistency 
combinations rules 
suggestions called protocols 
different aspects 
protocols, 
basic aspects that 
every application layer protocol 
provide, include type 
data payload format 
that exchange 
protocols 
way formatted 
packaged 
last thing you want in network 
communications is that applications 
dont understand others messages 
there different types 
messages that exchanged 
a request message, 
an application asks data 
a response message, 
an application provides data 
a control message, 
an application commands 
controls a remote application 
three basic types 
we will see later 
defining message type, 
protocol define 
fields within message, 
including position meaning 
last important thing is to define 
control communication rules 
regulations, addressing questions 
applications 
send messages, happens 
a response is received 
is received all, 
an undesired response is received 
to react to 
different control messages 
rules specified, 
compatible two different 
implementations protocol will 
will also increase 
complexity protocol 
to understand application 
layer protocols, 
we will take technologies that 
enable web experience an example 
web is dominant way 
humans to exchange 
consume information 
media internet 
key technologies that enable this 
exchange information following 
html 
hypertext markup language that defines 
content 
webpages formatted 
a web browser, application 
that reads html files 
presents in a human 
understandable formats 
a uri uniform resource identifier, 
is a way to address pages 
information web 
this is you 
web browser know to go to 
find next piece information 
example, wwwgooglecom is a uri 
tells you want to go a google search 
finally, http, 
hypertext transfer protocol 
you a browser that will 
access information 
uri, location 
to access 
html is format information 
question is will browser 
send a request receive html pages 
that is http comes in 
protocol via 
applications communicate 
is one, 
is one you encounter 
technologies, 
one that concerns us is http 
so lets look in light 
characteristics we defined 
application layer protocols previously, 
namely payload formats, 
message types, message syntax rules 
http is protocol via 
browser sends a request to 
remote server internet 
is inherently a stateless protocol, 
meaning that keeps information 
state connection 
subsequent request is 
sent via a new tcp connection 
there is an http property 
called keep alive, 
tells server to keep 
connection open subsequent requests 
we dealing embedded 
systems that limited memory 
might need to 
communicate that frequently, 
is recommended to disable 
keepalive to save memory 
a simple http request three sections 
first, method, defines 
type message you sending, 
sake simplicity type 
command you want server to execute 
second, uri rest remote server, 
third protocol version 
there another 
section called headers, 
gives extra information 
command 
heres an example request 
accessing googlecom 
lets go response message 
is a status code meaning okay, 
that command executed properly 
content type header 
shows type data 
format in server 
will send data 
in case, 
a text file formatted using html 
utf is text encoding 
there is also information type 
server that running 
date, time so 
lets look another example 
this time we send another command to 
google server, a post command 
post means that you want server to 
accept data you sending to 
we see that response code is 
meaning that you 
allowed to execute 
that specific command server 
server sends you list 
allowed commands a response 
examples demonstrated 
characteristics 
an application protocol 
different message types, 
formatting options 
control mechanisms that determine 
happens a desired 
undesired request action happens 
http is a mature protocol 
response 
control messages 
a wide variety situations 
web is composed 
text files 
there types content well 
example, images 
http supports transporting 
a different types 
medium text, 
images, audio video 
receiving end 
client side able to 
display process this data 
content type header tells client 
type data sent to 
depending upon browser 
target system, you either able 
unable to play received contents 
here common audio 
video format supported across systems 
browsers 
audio, mp 
aac license dependent 
therefore supported 
browsers like opera firefox 
if operating system 
proper codex installed, 
opera firefox will play formats 
ogg vorbis hand 
is an open standard format 
is supported firefox 
opera internet explorer 
wav format is supported 
modern browsers 
video, 
h is supported major browsers 
there hardware 
decoders available 
also offers good compression, 
might royalty free 
requires a license 
among free video codecs, vp 
theora formats 
supported major 
browsers except internet explorer 
there different protocols that 
allow you to stream media instead 
merely downloading in chunks 
progressive downloads, meaning 
downloading files in small chunks 
streaming technically work way 
a large file is cut small pieces 
transferred 
however, progressively 
downloading a video file, 
you might to wait whole 
file to download you play 
you play right away 
you move forward past portion 
that already downloaded 
you need streaming protocols to 
achieve fast forward, rewind, 
play, pause features 
benefit streaming 
media via http is that 
traffic goes a port 
is rarely blocked 
is also an affordable solution 
infrastructure is already available 
http streaming solutions scale 
according to users network 
that is, bit rate increased 
decreased based users 
network conditions 
a few examples http video 
streaming protocols hls apple, 
mpegdash developed mpeg 
an international 
standard since 
there is 
microsoft smooth streaming, 
supported iis, microsofts web server 
so a short review, in this 
lecture we looked specifics 
application layer protocols 
used http an example 
we discussed briefly types 
web streaming media 
in later lectures we will look 
protocols that make web 
video audio stream possible 
specifically, we will look 
transport protocols like tcp udp
