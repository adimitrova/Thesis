hello
,
welcome
to
this
online
course
on
web
connectivity
and
security
in
cyber
physical
systems
.
i
'll
be
your
lecturer
in
this
online
course
.
my
name
is
juha
plosila
and
i
teach
embedded
systems
engineering
at
the
university
of
turku
.
turku
is
a
beautiful
city
at
the
southwest
coast
of
finland
.
a
city
next
to
20,000
islands
,
and
one
that
35,000
higher
education
students
call
their
second
home
.
[

so
,
lets
talk
about
cyber
physical
systems
.
[
music

cyber
physical
systems
,
are
embedded
devices
that
interact
and
control
the
real
world
.
you
might
not
notice
them
,
but
they
are
everywhere
.
ever
wondered
how
the
stationary
escalator
starts
moving
when
you
get
near
them
?
there
are
sensors
that
detect
movement
and
a
small
computer
that
then
controls
the
motors
that
run
the
escalators
.
in
other
words
,
it
's
a
combination
of
sensors
and
actuators
that
control
the
escalator
,
a
physical
entity
.
it
is
a
system
where
computation
and
control
come
together
to
improve
efficiency
of
the
real
world
.
and
that
is
the
philosophy
behind
cyber
physical
systems
.
from
controlling
traffic
to
energy
transmission
to
running
factories
.
cyber
physical
systems
help
improve
real
world
efficiency
and
productivity
.
modern
cars
and
airplanes
are
examples
of
cyber
physical
systems
.
where
electronic
control
units
monitor
and
handle
the
different
aspects
of
these
physical
devices
.
but
these
isolated
systems
,
cyber
physical
systems
generally
do
not
work
isolated
.
their
impact
is
much
higher
when
they
are
connected
.
take
the
example
of
a
nationwide
network
of
cyber
physical
systems
managing
the
electric
grid
.
improving
efficiency
,
providing
configurability
and
reactiveness
in
cases
of
great
failures
or
excessive
loads
.
but
what
if
we
could
connect
our
cyber
physical
system
to
another
already
existing
worldwide
network
?
the
world
wide
web
or
www
for
short
,
that
is
what
we
will
talk
about
in
this
course
.
connecting
cyber
physical
systems
to
the
world
wide
web
.
the
course
is
divided
into
five
modules
.
in
the
first
three
modules
,
we
'll
talk
about
connectivity
in
cyber
physical
systems
.
and
go
all
the
way
to
the
advanced
topics
of
cloud
and
fog
computing
.
in
the
last
two
modules
,
we
will
teach
you
how
to
secure
these
systems
against
cyber
threats
.
if
you
want
to
build
your
understanding
of
the
web
,
web
connected
embedded
systems
or
internet
of
things
,
and
their
security
,
but
do
n't
know
where
to
begin
.
this
is
the
course
for
you
.
we
will
take
you
on
a
journey
from
the
fundamentals
of
the
internet
to
web
and
cloud
connectivity
.
and
then
towards
building
your
understanding
of
security
in
connected
systems
.
join
me
on
this
journey
as
i
strengthen
your
foundations
toward
web
connected
cyber
physical
systems
.
