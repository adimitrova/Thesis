hello, welcome to this online 
course web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
ill lecturer 
in this online course 
name is juha plosila 
i teach embedded systems engineering 
university turku 
turku is a beautiful city 
southwest coast finland 
a city next to , islands, 
one that , higher education 
students call second home 
music 
so, lets talk 
cyber physical systems 
music 
cyber physical systems, 
embedded devices that interact 
control real world 
you might notice them, 
everywhere 
ever wondered stationary escalator 
starts moving you get near 
there sensors that detect movement 
a small computer that controls 
motors that run escalators 
in words, 
a combination sensors 
actuators that control escalator, 
a physical entity 
is a system computation 
control come together to improve 
efficiency real world 
that is philosophy 
behind cyber physical systems 
controlling traffic to energy 
transmission to running factories 
cyber physical systems help improve 
real world efficiency productivity 
modern cars airplanes examples 
cyber physical systems 
electronic control units monitor 
handle different aspects 
physical devices 
isolated systems, cyber physical 
systems generally work isolated 
impact is much higher 
connected 
take example a nationwide 
network cyber physical systems 
managing electric grid 
improving efficiency, 
providing configurability 
reactiveness in cases great failures 
excessive loads 
if we could connect cyber 
physical system to another already 
existing worldwide network 
world wide web www short, that 
is we will talk in this course 
connecting cyber physical 
systems to world wide web 
course is divided five modules 
in first three modules, 
well talk connectivity 
in cyber physical systems 
go way to advanced 
topics cloud fog computing 
in last two modules, 
we will teach you to secure 
systems cyber threats 
if you want to build understanding 
web, web connected embedded systems 
internet things, security, 
dont know to begin 
this is course you 
we will take you a journey 
fundamentals internet to web 
cloud connectivity 
towards building 
understanding security 
in connected systems 
join this journey i 
strengthen foundations toward web 
connected cyber physical systems
