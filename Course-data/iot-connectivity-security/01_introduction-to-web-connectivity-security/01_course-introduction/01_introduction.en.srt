00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:13,691
Hello, welcome to this online
course on web connectivity and

3
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:17,266
security in cyber physical systems.

4
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:21,395
I'll be your lecturer
in this online course.

5
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,269
My name is Juha Plosila and

6
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,050
I teach embedded systems engineering
at the University of Turku.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,290
Turku is a beautiful city at
the southwest coast of Finland.

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,561
A city next to 20,000 islands, and

9
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:45,643
one that 35,000 higher education
students call their second home.

11
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,921
So, lets talk about
cyber physical systems.

12
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:06,921
[MUSIC]

13
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:20,895
Cyber physical systems,
are embedded devices that interact and

14
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:22,770
control the real world.

15
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,380
You might not notice them,
but they are everywhere.

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,480
Ever wondered how the stationary escalator
starts moving when you get near them?

17
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,830
There are sensors that detect movement and

18
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,840
a small computer that then controls
the motors that run the escalators.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,420
In other words,
it's a combination of sensors and

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,470
actuators that control the escalator,
a physical entity.

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,172
It is a system where computation and

22
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:03,084
control come together to improve
efficiency of the real world.

23
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:08,226
And that is the philosophy
behind cyber physical systems.

24
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:15,415
From controlling traffic to energy
transmission to running factories.

25
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:20,182
Cyber physical systems help improve
real world efficiency and productivity.

26
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:31,340
Modern cars and airplanes are examples
of cyber physical systems.

27
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,370
Where electronic control units monitor and

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,880
handle the different aspects
of these physical devices.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,180
But these isolated systems, cyber physical
systems generally do not work isolated.

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,490
Their impact is much higher
when they are connected.

31
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,750
Take the example of a nationwide
network of cyber physical systems

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,710
managing the electric grid.

33
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,110
Improving efficiency,
providing configurability and

34
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,391
reactiveness in cases of great failures or
excessive loads.

35
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,147
But what if we could connect our cyber
physical system to another already

36
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,140
existing worldwide network?

37
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,450
The World Wide Web or WWW for short, that
is what we will talk about in this course.

38
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,980
Connecting cyber physical
systems to the World Wide Web.

39
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,080
The course is divided into five modules.

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,400
In the first three modules,

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,150
we'll talk about connectivity
in cyber physical systems.

42
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,130
And go all the way to the advanced
topics of cloud and fog computing.

43
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,983
In the last two modules,

44
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:55,110
we will teach you how to secure
these systems against cyber threats.

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,790
If you want to build your understanding of
the web, web connected embedded systems or

46
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,120
Internet of Things, and their security,
but don't know where to begin.

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,180
This is the course for you.

48
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,040
We will take you on a journey from the
fundamentals of the internet to web and

49
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
cloud connectivity.

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,090
And then towards building your
understanding of security

51
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,409
in connected systems.

52
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,379
Join me on this journey as I
strengthen your foundations toward web

53
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,840
connected cyber physical systems.
