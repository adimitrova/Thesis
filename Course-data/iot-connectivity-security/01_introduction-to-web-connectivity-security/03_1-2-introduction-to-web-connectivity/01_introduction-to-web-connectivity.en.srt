00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,358
[SOUND] Welcome back to the video
lectures on web connectivity and

2
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:11,986
security in cyber-physical systems.

3
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:16,309
In this lecture, we'll go through
the basics of the internet and

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,577
web connectivity, including some
background information on the internet and

5
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:26,860
the nuts and bolts of its operation,
especially the Internet protocol suite.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,410
The basic communication
protocol of the Internet and

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,510
its layer design will be discussed.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,190
Let's start with the Internet.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,060
A group of connected
computers is a network.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,990
A group of connected networks from
a very large scale became the internet.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,930
One way of understanding new
technology is to look into its origins,

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,050
why was it developed?

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,240
This is a technique we'll
also use in later videos

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,299
when we learn different protocols.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,160
So to understand why there is a huge
network of connected computers,

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,620
let's look at its history.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,106
The internet came out of
the desire to have a robust,

18
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:17,330
fault-tolerant network of computers.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,510
There are two key takeaways here.

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,076
First, the network had to be robust and

21
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:29,840
full tolerant, and second,
it was for computers.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,240
We see both in the modern internet.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,900
We have a pocket base network where
each pocket can take a different route

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,009
to the destination.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,950
And the effect of being designed for
computers

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,860
is that it's essentially not what we would
call lightweight and power efficient.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,830
Take for example ethernet, designed for

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,380
computers at a time when
power was not a requirement.

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,015
It is one of the most power hungry
connectivity technologies for

30
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:10,690
cyber-physical systems out of the ones
that we will discuss in this course.

31
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,300
We have been moving from
an internet of connected computers

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,349
to an internet of connected devices or
things.

33
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,200
This requires new technologies or

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,890
changes to the current ones to suit
the needs of the new breed of systems.

35
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,980
The Internet is the network of computers,
but

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,620
what actually carries information
on top of this network?

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,758
One of the ways to carry and
display information over this network,

38
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:51,096
and here we mean Internet,
is the World Wide Web.

39
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:56,880
The World Wide Web is a way to organize
and present information for people.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,750
This is a common distinction that
many of us generally get wrong.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Internet connectivity means becoming
a part of this large worldwide network.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,926
Web connectivity, on the other hand,
means leveraging the web

43
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:20,284
technologies to now share
information over this network.

44
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:25,862
At the heart of these web
technologies are hypertext,

45
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:33,270
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or
HTTP, a web server, and a browser.

46
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,960
We need internet connectivity for

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,990
these web technologies to work, and
therefore, we will talk about both.

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,160
The technologies that enable us to connect
our cyber-physical systems to the Internet

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,590
and the technologies that enable us
to access and share over the web.

50
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,330
Here is a short overview of the web and
the Internet.

51
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,860
The Internet enables the existence
of the World Wide Web.

52
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:16,470
The World Wide Web facilitates interaction
and information sharing over the Internet.

53
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:24,390
If the Internet is a highway,
the web is the moving cars.

54
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:33,272
Let's continue a bit with the analogy
of the Internet being a highway and

55
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,639
the web being the moving cars.

56
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,990
There can be more than just one
type of cars moving the highway.

57
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,840
For example, there can be buses,
trucks, vans, and motor bikes.

58
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,316
Likewise, there is more than just
web traffic on the Internet.

59
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:59,140
There is e-mail, Usenet, File transfer
protocol, peer-to-peer sharing, and so on.

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,450
But what enables all of these
to share the same network?

61
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:10,010
The technology that enables different
types of traffic to share and

62
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,540
go through the same network is TCP/IP or

63
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,510
Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol, or

64
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,490
commonly known as
the Internet Protocol Suite.

65
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:31,060
A protocol is a set of rules and methods.

66
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,250
You can think of it as
the grammar of a spoken language.

67
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,140
These rules and

68
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,760
methods facilitates a standard way
of communicating and interacting.

69
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,070
The TCP/IP protocol suite is
therefore a set of standards and

70
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,380
methods that allow different devices and
systems to communicate over the Internet.

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,020
Because of the standard, it doesn't
matter what system, operating system,

72
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,140
or application you have.

73
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,049
As long as it can say,
speak TCP/IP language,

74
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:13,069
it can communicate with
others on the internet.

75
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:21,730
TCP/IP is divided into layers for
simplicity and understanding.

76
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,410
As there are multiple technologies that
make up TCP/IP, the classification

77
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,550
into layers makes it easy to
comprehend this inherent diversity.

78
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,440
It also enables the decoupling
of one technology from another.

79
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,970
Imagine having a wine glass with
a detachable base and body.

80
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,080
You could change the base depending
on the surface you'll be using.

81
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,140
If you need grip, you would use rigid base
while the body would remain the same.

82
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,930
And if you want to taste
different kinds of wine,

83
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,880
you just change the body on the top.

84
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:16,290
In the same way with TCP/IP layers
as you go from the top to bottom,

85
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,910
you can decide which technology
to use from each of the layers,

86
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,340
the technology that best suits your needs.

87
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,200
And if you develop your own technology,

88
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,859
you can place it in the appropriate
layers for others to use.

89
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:38,792
There are four layers in the TCP/IP model,

90
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:44,130
application, transport,
internet, and link.

91
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,690
We will discuss them next.

92
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,420
Here is an overview of each of
these layers and their functions.

93
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,110
We will discuss the protocols
on each of these layers, and

94
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,470
their specifications in detail later on.

95
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,410
The top-most layer is
the application layer.

96
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,810
If you are designing
a protocol that allows

97
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,480
different applications to communicate,
it will be placed on this layer.

98
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,590
We are not talking about the specific
application software but

99
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,080
the methods that
the application software will

100
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,440
use to communicate with another
application software over the network.

101
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,740
An example is one chat client sending
a message to another chat client.

102
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,955
If both these clients use
the chatting protocol at XMPP,

103
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:47,570
it doesn't matter who designed the chat
client or what platform it is running on.

104
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,530
They will be able to send and
receive messages.

105
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,944
Here, the application
layer protocol is XMPP.

106
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:05,408
The layer beneath the application
layer is the transport layer.

107
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:11,560
Its purpose is to establish host-to-host
communication from one device to another.

108
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,610
It receives data from the application
layer, it doesn't care what this data is,

109
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,070
and transmits the data to another
process on another host computer.

110
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,960
Imagine you have three browsers,
Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

111
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,300
And on the first one you entered Google,

112
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,300
on the second one you entered Yahoo,
and Bing on the third one.

113
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,920
In this case, you send three HTTP requests
from three separate applications.

114
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:56,680
HTTP is an application layer protocol.

115
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,960
The responses for

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,900
these requests are appropriately
provided to each application.

117
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,020
Chrome gets the Google page,
Firefox gets the Yahoo page, and

118
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,200
Internet Explorer gets the Bing page.

119
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,810
Now, all of them send similar requests,
but the data didn't get mixed up.

120
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,310
Why?

121
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,870
The transport layer, which provides
the data to the application layer,

122
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,140
is responsible for ensuring that each
process receives what was intended for it.

123
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
Moreover, this layer is responsible for

124
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,890
reliability, congestion control,
and multiplexing.

125
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,800
At the internet layer, which is
the next lower layer, the source and

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,200
destination addresses are attached to
packets coming from the higher layers.

127
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,640
This layer is responsible for
addressing and routing.

128
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,680
Also, when a packet is received,
it is the internet layer's

129
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,040
responsibility to forward it to
the appropriate transport layer protocol.

130
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,820
The link layer at the bottom of the
protocol stack specifies the standards and

131
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,320
methods that handle the physical link.

132
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,500
These protocols reside on the local link,

133
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,580
meaning that they are limited to
the scope of the local network.

134
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,010
For example, ARP, or
address resolution protocol, is

135
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,170
used to figure out the physical address,
that is the media access control or

136
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,140
MAC address against an Internet
protocol or IP address.

137
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,320
This is how your computer knows
which local device an IP packet

138
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,620
should be forwarded to.

139
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,470
A distinction to make here is that you
need a MAC address to send data in

140
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,220
a local network and an IP address
to send data across networks.

141
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,387
Sending data across networks is
an internet layer operation,

142
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:14,854
and sending data within local
network is a blink layer operation.

143
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:19,256
The TCP/IP link layer
doesn't assume anything about

144
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:23,810
the type of the physical medium and
its issues.

145
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,300
It just assumes that an underlying
physical link exists.

146
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,088
Therefore, the link layer represents
any media access protocol,

147
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:40,968
including wireless protocols such
as Wi-Fi, GSM, and bluetooth.

148
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,900
Here are some example protocols for
each layer.

149
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,900
As a recap, in this lesson, we looked
at the internet, the World Wide Web,

150
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,030
and the basics of the TCP/IP model.

151
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,111
In later videos, we will have a more
detailed look at the different layers and

152
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:03,154
their respective protocols.

153
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:07,229
