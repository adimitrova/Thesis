[SOUND] Hello, welcome back to the video
lectures on web connectivity and

2
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:12,278
security in cyber physical systems.

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:17,494
In this video lecture, we are going to
learn how two parties that don't know each

4
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:22,650
other previously can share a secret
through a public medium like the Internet.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,194
The shared secret could be and

6
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:30,778
often is the encryption key of
a symmetric key cipher system.

7
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,490
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,470
was published in 1976 as one of
the first public key protocols for

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,410
securely exchanging cryptographic
keys over public networks.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,250
The algorithm is based on
the concept of discrete logarithms.

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,861
Diffie-Hellman is not an actual
encryption algorithm,

12
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:58,800
meaning that it's not used to protect
data transfer between two parties.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,670
Let's explore how
the Diffie-Hellman protocol works.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,732
Suppose that Alice and Bob don't know
each other and they would like to share

15
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:16,363
an encryption key of a symmetric cipher in
order to initiate secure communication.

16
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:24,823
To do this, first, Alice and
Bob have to agree on two numbers,

17
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:28,281
a sufficiently large prime number p and

18
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:33,230
a base generator g,
which is a primitive root modulo P.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,420
Alice chooses a secret number or key a and

20
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,450
computes her public result, capital A,

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,660
as g to the power of a mod p and
sends it to Bob.

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,930
Bob also chooses a secret number or
key b and

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,780
computes his public results,
capital B, as g

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,540
to the power of b mod P and
sends it to Alice.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,120
At this point,
a potential attacker may intercept

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,190
their communication and
get the public results A and B.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,572
He might also capture p and g when Alice
and Bob are agreeing on these numbers.

28
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:26,715
Now, Alice computes a shared secret S1

29
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:32,620
with her secret key a as B
to the power of a mod p.

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,150
And, likewise,
Bob computes a shared secret S2 with

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,090
his secret key b as A to
the power of b mod p.

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,779
It can be mathematically proven that
S1 and S2 actually have the same value.

33
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,810
This shared number is Alice's and
Bob's shared secret and

34
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,907
can be used as an encryption
key of a symmetric cipher.

35
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:07,437
Because the attacker doesn't
know the secret keys a and b,

36
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,116
he will not be able to
compute the shared secret.

37
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:19,400
We just learned how Diffie-Hellman
is implemented mathematically.

38
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,648
Let's have a simpler example in order
to demonstrate how the protocol works.

39
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:31,690
Suppose Alice and
Bob know a common color yellow.

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,494
Alice chooses pink color and Bob chooses
green color as their secret colors.

41
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,780
Alice mixes her secret color with
the common color and produces a new color.

42
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,972
Bob also does the same.

43
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,410
They exchange the new colors.

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,880
Now they mix the new colors with
their secret colors and produce yet

45
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,610
another color.

46
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,350
Since the final color on each side is made
of the same combination of three colors,

47
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,670
yellow, pink and green,
it is identical on both sides.

48
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,908
So, Alice and Bob ended up with the same
final color without revealing their

49
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:27,080
own secret colors to each other.

50
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:35,470
As you can see on the screen,
the same thing happens mathematically.

51
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,219
The final values computed on each
side are actually identical.

52
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:45,411
Diffie-Hellman is one of the most
powerful security protocols and

53
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:49,609
is therefore still widely
used in many applications.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,250
For resource constraint devices,
the Diffie-Hellman protocol can be

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,210
implemented using elliptic
curve cryptography.

56
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,200
If you are interested to learn more about
lightweight Diffie-Hellman protocols,

57
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,624
you can search on the web for
elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman.

58
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,380
You will find many useful
tutorials on this topic.

59
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,140
In this video lecture,

60
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,160
we saw how the Diffie-Hellman protocol
is used to share secret information.

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,332
In the next lesson, we will learn
how to establish a public key

62
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:28,524
crypto system to secure
digital communication.
