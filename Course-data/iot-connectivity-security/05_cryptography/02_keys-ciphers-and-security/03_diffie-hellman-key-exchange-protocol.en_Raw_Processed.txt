sound hello, welcome back to video 
lectures web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
in this video lecture, we going to 
learn two parties that dont know 
previously share a secret 
a public medium like internet 
shared secret could 
often is encryption key 
a symmetric key cipher system 
diffiehellman key exchange algorithm 
published in one 
first public key protocols 
securely exchanging cryptographic 
keys public networks 
algorithm is based 
concept discrete logarithms 
diffiehellman is an actual 
encryption algorithm, 
meaning that used to protect 
data transfer between two parties 
lets explore 
diffiehellman protocol works 
suppose that alice bob dont know 
would like to share 
an encryption key a symmetric cipher in 
order to initiate secure communication 
to this, first, alice 
bob to agree two numbers, 
a sufficiently large prime number p 
a base generator g, 
is a primitive root modulo p 
alice chooses a secret number key a 
computes public result, capital a, 
g to power a mod p 
sends to bob 
bob also chooses a secret number 
key b 
computes public results, 
capital b, g 
to power b mod p 
sends to alice 
this point, 
a potential attacker may intercept 
communication 
get public results a b 
might also capture p g alice 
bob agreeing numbers 
now, alice computes a shared secret 
secret key a b 
to power a mod p 
and, likewise, 
bob computes a shared secret 
secret key b a to 
power b mod p 
mathematically proven that 
actually value 
this shared number is alices 
bobs shared secret 
used an encryption 
key a symmetric cipher 
attacker doesnt 
know secret keys a b, 
will able to 
compute shared secret 
we learned diffiehellman 
is implemented mathematically 
lets a simpler example in order 
to demonstrate protocol works 
suppose alice 
bob know a common color yellow 
alice chooses pink color bob chooses 
green color secret colors 
alice mixes secret color 
common color produces a new color 
bob also 
exchange new colors 
mix new colors 
secret colors produce yet 
another color 
since final color side is made 
combination three colors, 
yellow, pink green, 
is identical sides 
so, alice bob ended 
final color without revealing 
secret colors to 
you see screen, 
thing happens mathematically 
final values computed 
side actually identical 
diffiehellman is one 
powerful security protocols 
is therefore still widely 
used in many applications 
resource constraint devices, 
diffiehellman protocol 
implemented using elliptic 
curve cryptography 
if you interested to learn 
lightweight diffiehellman protocols, 
you search web 
elliptic curve diffiehellman 
you will find many useful 
tutorials this topic 
in this video lecture, 
we saw diffiehellman protocol 
is used to share secret information 
in next lesson, we will learn 
to establish a public key 
crypto system to secure 
digital communication
