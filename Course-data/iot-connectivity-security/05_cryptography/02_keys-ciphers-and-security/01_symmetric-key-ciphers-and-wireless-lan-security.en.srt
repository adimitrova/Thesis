00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:07,840
Hello, welcome back.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,300
In this lesson, we will learn about
common security approaches and

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,920
protocols for
wireless local area networks.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,910
These approaches are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,415
Wireless local area network,
Wireless LAN, or

7
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:28,090
Wi-Fi provides more flexibility
in setting up a network system.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,430
In a cyber physical system, which may
include a very large number of sensors and

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,840
actuators Wi-Fi or

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,480
some other wireless technology is the most
practical means of communication,

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,040
because of its cost efficiency and easier
integration with other network components.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,700
However, it can be the most
vulnerable component of a system,

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,940
if it's not securely implemented.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,110
As information is transmitted through
the air, an attacker has potentially

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,950
better chances to intercept the
transmission and capture sensitive data.

16
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:18,878
Wired Equivalence Privacy or
WEP is a cryptographic security protocol,

17
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:26,360
which was included in the I triple
E 802.11 wireless standard in 1999.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,290
WEP provides wireless security by
simulating physical access controls.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,409
However, WEP is a weak method,
and its password can

20
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,291
be broken in a few minutes
using available hacking tools.

21
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,925
WEP uses Rivest Cipher 4 or

22
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:51,831
RC4 stream cipher for encryption.

23
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:57,020
WEP was implemented in three
version with different key sizes.

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,110
In each version, a 24 bit random or
pseudorandom initialization vector IV

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,820
is contaminated with the key
to generate the RC4 keystream.

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,200
RC4 is a simple and
fast bit-oriented stream cipher,

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,840
which has demonstrated many
significant vulnerabilities.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,361
For this reason, WEP standard is not used
anymore for secure wireless communication.

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,650
In order to address the problems
caused by the weaknesses of WEP,

30
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,394
that is to improve the security of Wi-Fi,

31
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:43,430
an I triple E draft standard was
developed and named 802.11i.

32
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,306
In it's 2003 version,
the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol or

33
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:54,180
WPA was introduced as a more
secure replacement for web.

34
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,720
Like WEP, also WPA uses the RC4
stream cipher for encryption.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,530
However in WPA
a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,360
TKIP uses the hash function to
mix the initialization vector,

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,500
IV with a preshared key rather than
simply concatenating them like WEP.

38
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,230
This reduces the effectiveness
of the related key attacks.

39
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,750
For further assurance, the size of
an initialization vector is doubled from

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,150
24 bits to 48 bits.

41
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,110
Meaning, in practice, that the reuse time
of an initialization vector increased

42
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,870
from a few hours of WEP
to a few hundred years.

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,730
Moreover, by implementing
a packet sequence number,

44
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,839
WPA provides protection
against reply attacks.

45
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,450
It also provides a stronger message
integrity check called Michael compared to

46
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,850
WEP, which uses basic CRC or
cyclic redundancy check.

47
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,569
WPA uses the same hardware as WEP for
encryption in the access points.

48
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,910
Despite its features also WPA suffers
from many security vulnerabilities and

49
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,067
is currently considered
an unsecure protocol for Wi-Fi.

50
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:30,150
This the block diagram
of the WPA protocol.

51
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,710
As we discussed earlier, WPA offers
better security compared to WEP,

52
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,950
by using a hash function for
mixing pre-shared keys and

53
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,600
initialization vectors, devising
a sequence counter to avoid reply attacks,

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,500
and using a better data
integrity check algorithm.

55
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,162
Because of the vulnerabilities
of the WPA protocol,

56
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:05,132
a new security protocol called
WPA2 was introduced in the 2004

57
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:10,175
version of the I triple E
draft standard 802.11i.

58
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,669
It provides strong security for Wi-Fi.

59
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,920
WPA2 is based is based on
a new encryption method called

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,430
Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message
Authentication Code Protocol or CCMP,

61
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,870
which uses
the Advanced Encryption Standard, AES.

62
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
AES is a proven strong block cipher,

63
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,690
which was published in 2001 by National
Institute of Standards and Technology.

64
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,010
It is still widely used.

65
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,691
Hardware implementation of WPA2 requires

66
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:53,634
additional components in wireless devices,

67
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:59,524
because unlike WPA,
it cannot utilize WEP hardware.

68
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:07,620
Both WPA and WPA2 offer two authentication
modes, personal and enterprise.

69
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,930
In the personal authentication mode,
a pre-shared key is used as a password.

70
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,189
Hence, they are vulnerable
to weak passwords.

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,880
In the enterprise mode,
a more advanced authentication called

72
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,260
extensible authentication protocol or
EAP is used.

73
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,910
You can easily find further
information on WPA2,

74
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,591
its related protocols and
authentication modes in the Internet.

75
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,170
In this lesson, we learned about different
wireless LAN security mechanisms, and

76
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,170
more specifically we learned about WEP,
WPA and

77
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,830
WPA2 protocols.

78
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,096
In the next video lecture, we will have
a closer look at public key cryptography.
