hello, welcome back 
in this lesson, we will look 
concept public infrastructure, 
learn two 
important applications, 
namely digital signatures 
digital certificates 
a public key infrastructure, pki, 
is a fundamental component many 
security protocols web 
a pki is a collection software, 
hardware, people, 
policies, 
processes that aim to manage, generate, 
distribute, revoke cryptographic 
keys digital certificates 
digital certificates 
documents that used to 
prove ownership public keys 
public key cryptography 
is a powerful tool, 
is widely used in 
many security solutions 
one important uses 
public key cryptography is to provide 
confidentiality information 
in electronics communications 
this is made possible 
encryption data 
public key cryptography also 
used following purposes 
first, ensuring integrity 
data in digital communication 
second, identification authentication 
third, ensuring nonrepudiation 
in digital communications 
nonrepudiation associates 
actions to individuals, 
so that cannot deny 
actions performed 
fourth, facilitating 
establishment trust 
between two parties that 
dont know 
fifth, sharing a session key 
in encrypted communication 
symmetric encryption is faster 
computationally simpler, 
actual data is typically 
encrypted using symmetric ciphers 
while asymmetric 
public key ciphers used 
exchanging encryption keys symmetric 
ciphers in a communication session 
next, we going to learn 
public key encryption is capable 
providing solutions 
along encryption data session 
keys, provides confidentiality, 
public keys systems also used 
making digital signatures 
similar to normal signature a paper, 
a digital signature is a technique 
providing authentication 
nonrepudiation sender 
ensuring integrity data in 
electronic communications 
lets see a digital signature works 
suppose alice 
bob want to communicate 
a pair keys, 
including one public key 
one private key 
alice bobs public key 
so, encrypt 
message using public key 
send encrypted message to 
we mentioned in another lecture, 
one, including alice herself, 
decrypt message, except one 
corresponding private key 
so, bob receives message, 
decrypts private key 
in fact, anyone bobs public key 
will able to communicate him, 
so bob needs to make sure that 
message really sent alice 
in a paper based communication, 
alice could sign paper so 
that bob could authenticate 
signature 
likewise in digital communication, 
alice needs to associate 
digital signature message 
to that computes hash 
value whole message, 
is called message digest 
needs to encrypt message 
digest using private key 
result is alices digital signature 
message is encrypted 
bobs public key 
append digital 
signature to encrypted message 
send to bob 
bob receives message 
alices digital signature 
first, decrypts message 
using private key 
computes message 
digest received data, 
using hash function alice 
decrypts digital 
signature alices public key 
gets message digest 
compares two versions 
message digest 
if identical, 
bob conclude that message 
sent alice 
moreover, also ensure 
that message 
altered received 
since alice signed 
message private key, 
anyone public key 
verify if sent message 
therefore, will 
able to deny signature 
this guarantees nonrepudiation 
alices message 
so, we learned a digital signature, 
employs public key encryption, 
ensure authenticity, 
integrity nonrepudiation 
now, consider alice 
bob scenario 
communication starts, 
alice needs to get bobs public key 
imagine that alice 
received bobs public key, 
an adversary breaks system 
sends alice another public key, 
created pretending to bob 
so question is, 
alice authenticate 
public key received 
sure that 
really belongs to bob 
well, solution is rather obvious 
alice rely a trusted third 
party to certify bobs public key 
this third party is called 
a certificate authority, ca 
document that contains 
verified public key is 
called a digital certificate 
cas usually companies that issue 
certificates charge customers 
lets see a digital certificate works 
suppose that bob wants to 
send public key to alice 
alice bob know a ca trust 
so bob sends public key 
identification information to ca 
ca verifies bobs identity, 
generates a certificate, 
contains bobs public key 
additional information 
ca signs certificate 
private key sends to bob 
instead sending 
public key such, 
bob sends public key 
certificate to alice 
alice check certificate 
get bobs authentic 
public key decrypting 
cas signature in digital 
certificate cas public key 
ca manages public keys 
certified by, 
example, revoking compromised keys 
setting validation 
suspension periods keys 
this kind status information 
is part a certificate 
in this lesson, 
we learned public key encryption 
mechanisms that use public key encryption 
ensure authenticity, integrity, 
nonrepudiation, establishment 
trust between two parties 
in next video lecture, we will 
learn public key infrastructure 
used in communication security 
protocols dls, ssl, dtls
