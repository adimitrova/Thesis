hello
,
welcome
back
,
this
is
the
last
lesson
in
the
module
cryptographic
solutions
for
cyber
physical
systems
.
it
also
concludes
the
course
,
web
connectivity
and
security
in
cyber
physical
systems
.
in
this
final
video
lecture
,
we
will
look
into
the
transport
layer
security
protocol
,
what
it
is
,
and
how
it
works
.
transport
layer
security
or
tls
is
a
cryptographic
protocol
,
which
facilitates
secure
communication
or
networks
.
the
predecessor
of
tls
is
called
secure
socket
layer
or
ssl
.
in
fact
,
also
tls
is
often
referred
to
as
ssl
,
because
both
of
these
protocols
offer
the
same
basic
functionality
,
and
the
first
version
of
tls
is
heavily
based
on
the
last
version
of
ssl
.
tls
provides
a
secured
tunnel
between
two
hosts
.
the
primary
goal
of
tls
is
to
provide
privacy
and
data
integrity
between
communicating
applications
,
for
example
,
between
web
browsers
and
web
servers
.
the
tls
protocol
is
implemented
on
top
of
a
reliable
transport
protocol
,
such
as
the
transmission
control
protocol
,
or
tcp
.
or
a
datagram-oriented
transport
protocol
,
such
as
the
user
datagram
protocol
,
udp
,
and
the
datagram
congestion
control
protocol
,
dccp
.
the
tls
protocol
is
composed
of
two
base
protocols
,
called
the
handshake
protocol
and
the
record
protocol
.
information
transferred
through
tls
is
protected
using
symmetric
cryptography
.
unique
keys
for
symmetric
encryption
are
generated
for
each
session
and
exchanged
using
the
handshake
protocol
at
the
start
of
the
session
.
the
handshake
protocol
enables
the
client
and
server
to
authenticate
each
other
and
select
an
encryption
algorithm
prior
to
sending
the
data
.
the
handshake
protocol
uses
the
public
key
cryptography
to
establish
a
shared
secret
key
for
symmetric
encryption
between
a
client
,
which
is
usually
a
web
browser
and
a
server
,
which
provides
a
service
to
the
client
.
in
addition
to
the
shared
secret
key
,
the
handshake
protocol
also
exchanges
some
other
information
,
such
as
message
formatting
instructions
.
suppose
you
are
trying
to
buy
something
from
the
amazon
website
,
to
start
a
secure
transaction
,
a
tls
or
ssl
connection
is
established
between
your
browser
and
the
amazon
server
.
first
,
your
browser
sends
a
hello
message
to
amazon
server
to
request
for
a
tls
or
ssl
connection
.
this
message
also
includes
some
essential
information
,
such
as
session
id
and
a
list
of
cipher
suits
.
that
is
combinations
of
cryptographic
methods
supported
by
your
system
.
then
the
server
chooses
one
of
the
offered
cipher
suits
,
and
sends
a
server
hello
message
,
which
includes
a
certificate
and
the
selected
cipher
suite
.
the
certificate
contains
the
servers
public
key
,
which
is
verified
and
signed
by
a
certificate
authority
.
in
some
cases
,
the
server
might
want
to
also
authenticate
the
client
.
in
this
case
,
it
sends
also
an
authentication
request
as
part
of
the
server
hello
message
.
once
your
browser
has
received
the
servers
certificate
,
it
will
verify
and
validate
the
certificate
.
then
if
everything
is
all
right
,
the
browser
will
generate
a
session
key
and
encrypt
it
with
the
server
's
public
key
and
send
it
to
the
server
.
handshaking
has
now
been
completed
.
and
your
browser
and
the
amazon
server
are
ready
to
start
a
secure
communication
.
the
second
part
of
the
tls
protocol
is
the
record
protocol
.
after
establishing
a
shared
secret
key
using
the
handshake
protocol
,
the
record
protocol
provides
a
secure
communication
session
between
the
client
and
the
server
using
the
shared
secret
key
.
the
record
protocol
has
multiple
responsibilities
.
first
,
it
splits
the
message
,
which
it
received
from
the
application
layer
into
fixed
size
blocks
of
data
.
compresses
them
if
required
,
and
then
adds
a
message
authentication
code
or
mac
.
this
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
media
access
control
concept
at
the
link
layer
.
a
mac
has
the
same
function
as
a
digital
signature
.
it
is
used
for
message
authentication
and
integrity
checking
.
a
digital
signature
is
generated
by
using
public
key
cryptography
to
encrypt
a
hash
value
of
a
message
with
a
sender
's
private
key
.
a
mac
is
also
obtained
by
encrypting
the
hash
value
of
a
message
,
but
now
a
shared
symmetric
key
is
used
.
since
symmetric
cryptography
is
use
for
a
mac
,
it
is
faster
to
generate
and
verify
it
in
a
normal
digital
signature
.
after
generating
and
appending
the
mac
,
the
record
protocol
encrypts
the
message
block
with
the
shared
symmetric
key
.
as
the
last
step
,
it
adds
a
tls
header
and
sends
the
message
block
to
the
other
party
.
on
the
receiver
side
,
the
message
block
is
first
decrypted
using
the
shared
key
.
then
its
authenticity
and
integrity
are
verified
by
comparing
the
mac
computer
from
the
received
message
block
with
the
one
appended
to
the
block
.
tls
or
ssl
secure
connections
are
widely
used
in
contemporary
websites
.
if
a
website
uses
such
a
connection
,
https
appears
in
the
beginning
of
the
web
address
,
which
indicates
that
a
secure
connection
has
been
established
.
https
stands
for
hypertext
transfer
protocol
secure
.
typically
,
there
's
also
a
small
padlock
icon
beside
the
address
line
.
if
you
click
on
the
padlock
,
you
will
see
information
about
the
secure
connection
in
question
as
well
as
the
certificate
which
the
website
has
sent
to
your
browser
.
if
the
certificate
becomes
invalid
for
some
reason
,
you
will
notice
a
red
line
across
the
https
acronym
indicating
that
the
connection
is
still
secure
,
but
the
server
can
not
be
verified
.
a
normal
http
connection
is
establish
when
the
web
address
in
your
browser
begin
with
the
http
acronym
.
and
there
is
no
padlock
icon
present
,
indicating
a
connection
which
is
not
secured
by
tls
or
ssl
.
digital
certificates
and
information
on
their
issuing
authorities
are
stored
in
your
browser
.
you
can
simply
check
them
in
the
settings
of
your
browser
.
for
example
,
in
this
image
you
see
firefox
settings
.
if
you
click
on
view
certificates
,
in
the
advanced
menu
and
certificate
tabs
,
you
will
see
the
list
of
certificate
authorities
and
their
issued
certificates
.
protocol
such
as
session
initiation
protocol
,
or
sip
,
and
electronic
gaming
protocols
are
getting
more
and
more
popular
.
such
protocols
are
based
on
the
user
datagram
protocol
or
udp
and
require
secure
communication
.
datagram-based
protocols
can
not
directly
use
tls
,
because
of
their
delay-sensitive
nature
.
the
datagram
transport
layer
security
protocol
,
or
dtls
,
is
a
natural
extension
of
tls
over
udp
.
with
maximized
reuse
of
code
and
infrastructure
to
minimize
the
need
for
new
security
invention
.
like
tls
,
also
dtls
is
designed
to
provide
communication
privacy
with
equivalent
security
guarantees
for
datagrams
.
tls
is
inefficient
for
datagram-oriented
transport
protocols
,
because
due
to
the
inherent
features
of
dtls
,
possible
lost
or
out
of
order
packets
can
cause
unpredictable
communication
delays
.
this
is
not
acceptable
or
tolerable
for
delay
senstive
udp
based
applications
.
a
tls
handshake
breaks
if
the
handshake
messages
are
not
delivered
reliably
or
in
order
,
or
are
lost
.
to
solve
this
,
dtls
assigns
a
specific
sequence
number
for
each
handshake
message
within
the
handshaking
process
.
it
also
uses
a
simple
retransmission
timer
for
each
message
.
once
a
receiver
receives
a
handshake
message
,
it
determines
,
by
checking
the
sequence
number
,
if
the
message
is
in
order
or
not
.
if
the
right
sequence
number
is
detected
,
the
message
is
processed
.
otherwise
,
it
is
queued
for
future
delivery
.
a
queued
message
is
processed
only
when
all
previous
messages
have
been
received
.
on
the
sender
side
,
if
the
sender
does
n't
get
any
reply
for
its
handshake
message
before
the
retransmission
time
runs
out
,
it
will
resend
that
specific
message
.
the
record
protocols
of
dtls
and
tls
are
very
similar
.
the
difference
is
that
dtls
uses
sequence
numbers
to
re-order
out
of
order
packets
.
this
concludes
our
course
on
web
connectivity
and
security
in
cyber
physical
systems
.
we
started
with
the
basics
of
the
internet
,
and
learned
about
its
layered
structure
and
involved
communication
and
connectivity
protocols
.
then
we
learned
how
to
design
web
connected
cyber
physical
systems
.
we
also
learned
that
cyber
physical
systems
have
a
close
relationship
with
internet
of
things
and
cloud
computing
.
in
the
security
segment
of
the
course
,
we
learned
about
the
basic
concepts
and
components
of
security
and
privacy
,
and
so
how
cryptographic
solutions
can
be
used
to
secure
your
system
.
that
's
it
,
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
the
course
.
thanks
for
