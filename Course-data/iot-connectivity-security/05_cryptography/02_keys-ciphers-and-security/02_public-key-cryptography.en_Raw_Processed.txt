hi, welcome back 
previously, we introduced 
cryptography a tool 
security solutions in 
cyber physical systems 
we also presented symmetry key ciphers 
used securing wireless networks 
in this video lecture, we will learn 
public key cryptography works, 
we will a close look 
wellknown rsa algorithm 
public key cryptography 
comprises a set algorithms 
that designed based 
mathematical problems 
we discussed earlier, 
unlike in symmetric cryptography, 
in public key cryptography decryption 
key is encryption key 
this reason is also 
known asymmetric cryptography 
a pair key is called a public key 
a private key used in a system 
public key, 
is clear name, 
is publicly known everybody 
is used 
encryption, while private key is 
kept secret used decryption 
so anybody encrypt message 
recipients public key, 
recipient decrypt 
using private key 
this eliminates need 
a secure channel to exchange 
key between two parties 
in a public key cryptography, key 
pairs mathematically related, 
is computationally infeasible to get 
decryption key encryption key 
lets a brief look 
important 
popular public key encryption algorithms 
rivestshamiradlerman 
rsa algorithm is one 
practical 
secure public key algorithms, 
is widely used 
secure communication 
rsa, is named three 
inventors published in 
provides three main functionalities, 
key generation, encryption, 
decryption 
diffiehellman, dh protocol, 
provides an efficient secure way 
exchanging an encryption key often 
symmetric cipher a public channel 
without need a secure channel 
diffiehellman is one 
earliest applications 
public key encryption, 
published in 
this protocol is still 
used in many applications 
elliptic curve cryptography 
ecc provides an alternative mechanism 
public key encryption 
introduced in 
ecc is based algebraic elliptic 
curves finite fields 
offer smaller keys 
a reasonable level security 
compared to public 
key encryption algorithms 
is therefore known 
a lightweight encryption method 
ecc is widely use in embedded 
resource constraint devices 
provides many applications 
public encryption as, 
encryption decryption, digital 
signatures, digital certificates 
to demonstrate a public key 
system mathematically works, 
we will first a bit closer look 
popular rsa algorithm 
in another lecture, we will also 
a look diffiehellman algorithm 
we use classic algorithms 
examples, well known 
relatively easy to present 
in a short lecture 
if you interested in details ecc, 
i encourage you to search 
related online documentation 
there is a lot information 
ecc in a reader friendly forum 
complex mathematics behind ecc 
is scope this course 
so, lets look rsa 
we start generation public 
private keys 
first step is to choose two 
relatively large prime numbers p q 
typically, , bits in length 
next step is to calculate 
product n p q, 
product phin p q 
n later becomes modulus 
public 
private keys, we will see shortly 
now, encryption key e is chosen in 
a way that needs two properties 
first, e to 
relatively prime to phin 
second, e to greater 
less phin 
two integers relatively prime if 
share common positive factors 
divisors except 
in words, greatest common 
divisor e phin must 
we use a tuple notation greatest 
common divisor shown screen 
public key is pair e n 
lets see private 
key is calculated 
if e phi n prime, 
there is integer d 
decryption, that e times 
d equals one modular phin 
private key is defined 
pair d n 
notice that without knowing p q is 
practically impossible to determine d 
security rsa relies 
this observation 
that we generated keys, 
we encrypt decrypt a message 
in rsa, a full message is 
presented a sequence 
positive integers between n 
taking a fix number bits 
depending value modulus n 
applies to 
produced cipher text 
simplicity, 
lets consider a message m, 
is composed a single 
integer between n 
encryption, we take message m 
compute ciphertext c m 
to power e modular n 
decryption we take 
cypher text c 
compute message m c 
to power d modulo n 
lets try an example 
suppose two primes, p 
q, respectively 
n is equal to , 
phin is equal to 
we select 
encryption exponent, e 
divisors phin , 
, , , , , , 
so, could number less , 
common divisor 
candidates, well, lets pick seven 
we select 
decryption exponent d, 
that d times e equals mod 
lets pick , 
satisfies given condition, 
times equals , 
equals times plus 
determining d is computationally 
a nontrivial task 
best way is to use 
extended euclidean algorithm 
we dont study this algorithm here though 
so, here is, 
public key is pair , 
, 
private key is pair , 
now, lets check encryption 
decryption work 
first, message m could 
integer between 
lets randomly pick number 
encryption to get ciphertext c, 
we calculate 
to power modulo , 
equals 
so ciphertext c is 
lets decrypt cypher text 
see if we get original message 
plain text in 
we calculate to power , 
modulo , 
which, amazingly, equals 
so worked, we managed to 
retrieve original message m 
in this lesson, we learned 
basics public key cryptography 
moreover, we saw we 
protect confidentiality 
data rsa public key encryption 
in next video lecture, 
we will learn public key 
encryption is used establishing 
a shared secret between two parties 
that dont know previously
