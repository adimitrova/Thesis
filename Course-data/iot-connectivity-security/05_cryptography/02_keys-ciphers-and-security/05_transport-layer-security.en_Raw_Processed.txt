hello, welcome back, 
this is last lesson in module 
cryptographic solutions 
cyber physical systems 
also concludes course, 
web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
in this final video lecture, we will 
look transport layer security 
protocol, is, works 
transport layer security 
tls is a cryptographic protocol, 
facilitates secure communication 
networks 
predecessor tls is called 
secure socket layer ssl 
in fact, 
also tls is often referred to ssl, 
protocols 
offer basic functionality, 
first version tls is heavily 
based last version ssl 
tls provides a secured 
tunnel between two hosts 
primary goal tls is to provide 
privacy data integrity between 
communicating applications, example, 
between web browsers web servers 
tls protocol is implemented 
top a reliable transport protocol, 
transmission control protocol, 
tcp 
a datagramoriented transport protocol, 
user datagram protocol, 
udp, datagram congestion 
control protocol, dccp 
tls protocol is composed 
two base protocols, 
called handshake protocol 
record protocol 
information transferred tls is 
protected using symmetric cryptography 
unique keys symmetric encryption 
generated session 
exchanged using handshake 
protocol start session 
handshake protocol enables client 
server to authenticate 
select an encryption algorithm 
prior to sending data 
handshake protocol uses public key 
cryptography to establish a shared secret 
key symmetric encryption between a 
client, is usually a web browser 
a server, 
provides a service to client 
in addition to shared secret key, 
handshake protocol also exchanges 
information, 
message formatting instructions 
suppose you trying to buy 
something amazon website, 
to start a secure transaction, a tls 
ssl connection is established between 
browser amazon server 
first, browser sends a hello 
message to amazon server to request 
a tls ssl connection 
this message also includes 
essential information, 
session id 
a list cipher suits 
that is combinations cryptographic 
methods supported system 
server chooses one offered 
cipher suits, sends a server 
hello message, includes a 
certificate selected cipher suite 
certificate contains 
servers public key, 
is verified 
signed a certificate authority 
in cases, server might want 
to also authenticate client 
in this case, 
sends also an authentication request 
part server hello message 
browser received servers 
certificate, will verify 
validate certificate 
if everything is right, 
browser will generate a session key 
encrypt servers public 
key send to server 
handshaking completed 
browser amazon server 
ready to start a secure communication 
second part tls 
protocol is record protocol 
establishing a shared secret 
key using handshake protocol, 
record protocol provides a secure 
communication session between client 
server using 
shared secret key 
record protocol 
multiple responsibilities 
first, splits message, 
received application layer 
fixed size blocks data 
compresses if required, adds 
a message authentication code mac 
this is to confused media 
access control concept link layer 
a mac function 
a digital signature 
is used message authentication 
integrity checking 
a digital signature is generated 
using public key cryptography 
to encrypt a hash value a message 
a senders private key 
a mac is also obtained encrypting 
hash value a message, 
a shared symmetric key is used 
since symmetric cryptography is use 
a mac, is faster to generate 
verify in a normal digital signature 
generating 
appending mac, record protocol 
encrypts message block 
shared symmetric key 
last step, adds a tls header 
sends message block 
to party 
receiver side, message block 
is first decrypted using shared key 
authenticity integrity 
verified comparing mac 
computer received message block 
one appended to block 
tls ssl secure connections widely 
used in contemporary websites 
if a website uses a connection, 
https appears in beginning 
web address, indicates that 
a secure connection established 
https stands 
hypertext transfer protocol secure 
typically, theres also a small 
padlock icon beside address line 
if you click padlock, you will see 
information secure connection in 
question well certificate 
website sent to browser 
if certificate becomes invalid 
reason, 
you will notice a red line across 
https acronym indicating that 
connection is still secure, 
server cannot verified 
a normal http connection is establish 
web address in browser 
begin http acronym 
there is padlock icon present, 
indicating a connection 
is secured tls ssl 
digital certificates 
information issuing 
authorities stored in browser 
you simply check in 
settings browser 
example,in this image 
you see firefox settings 
if you click view certificates, 
in advanced menu certificate tabs, 
you will see list certificate 
authorities issued certificates 
protocol session 
initiation protocol, 
sip, electronic gaming protocols 
getting popular 
protocols based 
user datagram protocol 
udp require secure communication 
datagrambased protocols 
cannot directly use tls, 
delaysensitive nature 
datagram transport 
layer security protocol, 
dtls, 
is a natural extension tls udp 
maximized reuse code 
infrastructure to minimize need 
new security invention 
like tls, also dtls is designed 
to provide communication 
privacy equivalent security 
guarantees datagrams 
tls is inefficient 
datagramoriented transport protocols, 
due to inherent 
features dtls, possible lost 
order packets cause 
unpredictable communication delays 
this is acceptable tolerable 
delay senstive udp based applications 
a tls handshake breaks if handshake 
messages delivered reliably 
in order, lost 
to solve this, dtls assigns 
a specific sequence number 
handshake message within 
handshaking process 
also uses a simple retransmission 
timer message 
a receiver receives 
a handshake message, determines, 
checking sequence number, 
if message is in order 
if right sequence number is detected, 
message is processed 
otherwise, is queued 
future delivery 
a queued message is processed 
previous messages received 
sender side, if sender doesnt 
get reply handshake message 
retransmission time runs out, 
will resend that specific message 
record protocols dtls 
tls similar 
difference is that dtls uses sequence 
numbers to reorder order packets 
this concludes course 
web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
we started basics 
internet, learned layered 
structure involved communication 
connectivity protocols 
we learned to design web 
connected cyber physical systems 
we also learned that cyber physical 
systems a close relationship 
internet things 
cloud computing 
in security segment course, 
we learned basic concepts 
components security privacy, 
so cryptographic solutions 
used to secure system 
thats it, 
i hope you enjoyed course 
thanks attending, bye, bye
