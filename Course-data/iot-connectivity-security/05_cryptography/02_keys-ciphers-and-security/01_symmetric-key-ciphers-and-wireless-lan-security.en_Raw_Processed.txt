hello, welcome back 
in this lesson, we will learn 
common security approaches 
protocols 
wireless local area networks 
approaches based 
symmetric key cryptography 
wireless local area network, 
wireless lan, 
wifi provides flexibility 
in setting a network system 
in a cyber physical system, may 
include a large number sensors 
actuators wifi 
wireless technology is 
practical means communication, 
cost efficiency easier 
integration network components 
however, 
vulnerable component a system, 
if securely implemented 
information is transmitted 
air, an attacker potentially 
better chances to intercept 
transmission capture sensitive data 
wired equivalence privacy 
wep is a cryptographic security protocol, 
included in i triple 
e wireless standard in 
wep provides wireless security 
simulating physical access controls 
however, wep is a weak method, 
password 
broken in a few minutes 
using available hacking tools 
wep uses rivest cipher 
rc stream cipher encryption 
wep implemented in three 
version different key sizes 
in version, a bit random 
pseudorandom initialization vector iv 
is contaminated key 
to generate rc keystream 
rc is a simple 
fast bitoriented stream cipher, 
demonstrated many 
significant vulnerabilities 
this reason, wep standard is used 
anymore secure wireless communication 
in order to address problems 
caused weaknesses wep, 
that is to improve security wifi, 
an i triple e draft standard 
developed named i 
in version, 
wifi protected access protocol 
wpa introduced a 
secure replacement web 
like wep, also wpa uses rc 
stream cipher encryption 
however in wpa 
a temporal key integrity protocol 
tkip uses hash function to 
mix initialization vector, 
iv a preshared key rather 
simply concatenating like wep 
this reduces effectiveness 
related key attacks 
assurance, size 
an initialization vector is doubled 
bits to bits 
meaning, in practice, that reuse time 
an initialization vector increased 
a few hours wep 
to a few hundred years 
moreover, implementing 
a packet sequence number, 
wpa provides protection 
reply attacks 
also provides a stronger message 
integrity check called michael compared to 
wep, uses basic crc 
cyclic redundancy check 
wpa uses hardware wep 
encryption in access points 
despite features also wpa suffers 
many security vulnerabilities 
is currently considered 
an unsecure protocol wifi 
this block diagram 
wpa protocol 
we discussed earlier, wpa offers 
better security compared to wep, 
using a hash function 
mixing preshared keys 
initialization vectors, devising 
a sequence counter to avoid reply attacks, 
using a better data 
integrity check algorithm 
vulnerabilities 
wpa protocol, 
a new security protocol called 
wpa introduced in 
version i triple e 
draft standard i 
provides strong security wifi 
wpa is based is based 
a new encryption method called 
counter mode cipher block chaining message 
authentication code protocol ccmp, 
uses 
advanced encryption standard, aes 
aes is a proven strong block cipher, 
published in national 
institute standards technology 
is still widely used 
hardware implementation wpa requires 
additional components in wireless devices, 
unlike wpa, 
cannot utilize wep hardware 
wpa wpa offer two authentication 
modes, personal enterprise 
in personal authentication mode, 
a preshared key is used a password 
hence, vulnerable 
to weak passwords 
in enterprise mode, 
a advanced authentication called 
extensible authentication protocol 
eap is used 
you easily find 
information wpa, 
related protocols 
authentication modes in internet 
in this lesson, we learned different 
wireless lan security mechanisms, 
specifically we learned wep, 
wpa 
wpa protocols 
in next video lecture, we will 
a closer look public key cryptography
