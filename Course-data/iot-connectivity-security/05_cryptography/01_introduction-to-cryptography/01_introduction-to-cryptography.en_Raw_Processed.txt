sound hello, welcome back to online 
course web connectivity 
security in cyber physical systems 
this lesson starts a module 
a cryptographic solutions 
cyber physical systems 
is last module course 
in this video lecture, 
we will look basic concepts 
techniques cryptography 
cryptography is a scientific 
engineering field develops 
analyzes mathematical techniques so 
many different information, security, 
privacy issues confidentiality, 
data integrity, 
entity authentication 
data origin authentication 
cryptography a long 
fascinating history 
egyptians used kind encryption 
in messages , years ago 
in th century, 
world war i 
ii, cryptography used to protect 
sensitive war related information 
even though usage 
modern cryptography 
originally focus military applications, 
today widely use 
protecting digital information 
in general, everywhere 
this development began in 
boosted proliferation 
computers communication 
systems last decades 
main goal cryptography 
is to hide protect sensitive 
information is called a plaintext, 
adversaries attackers 
you imagine that you protect 
belongings inside a suitcase 
a padlock 
idea is that one needs 
key padlock to get 
stuff suitcase 
cyber system essentially 
works in way 
plain text, is encrypted, 
using a cryptographic algorithm, 
corresponds to padlock 
algorithm takes plain text 
encryption key input, 
a result, a cipher text is generated 
cipher text is a new form 
combination plain text 
is readable a human 
a computer without decrypting 
therefore, cipher text 
safely sent to another party 
receiver side, if receiver 
right decryption key, 
will able to decrypt cipher 
text to discover original message 
secrecy a cipher system is highly 
dependent secrecy key 
so, exchange decryption key 
done in a secured way 
attackers perspective, main 
challenge is to determine plain text 
a cypher text 
without knowing key 
decryption key to 
always encryption key 
there two types cipher systems, 
a symmetric key cipher system 
an asymmetric key 
public key cipher system 
in a symmetric key cipher system, 
decryption key is identical 
to encryption key 
easily obtained 
encryption key 
in this case, there is a need 
a secure channel key exchange 
in an asymmetric key 
public key cypher system, 
encryption key is 
decryption key 
is computation in principle 
practical to obtain decryption 
key encryption key 
in this case a pair 
different keys, one 
encryption decryption 
encryption key is publicly available, 
so 
everyone public 
key encrypt message 
decryption key is secret 
is referred to private key 
so one private 
key decrypt message 
establishing a public key cipher system 
is computationally complex 
requires resources 
symmetric encryption 
therefore, is usually used 
shorter messages 
in practice, a public key system 
is used encrypting 
transferring encryption 
key a symmetric key system 
symmetric ciphers far divided 
stream ciphers block ciphers 
in a stream cipher, plaintext is 
encrypted bit bit byte byte 
simplicity, 
we call this unit encryption a digit 
so instead one single key, 
stream cipher requires a stream 
keys to encrypt every digit 
in this model, cipher text stream is 
calculated an exclusive 
a modular to addition 
every digit in plaintext stream 
corresponding digit in key stream 
key stream is used 
decryption receiver 
side in similar manner 
key streams generated random 
pseudorandom digits 
so, security a stream 
cipher is highly dependent 
key stream generation process 
stream ciphers small fast, 
thats suitable 
embedded resource constrain devices 
in contrast to a stream cipher, 
a block cipher 
uses a single key to encrypt fixed 
size block plain text a time 
blocks cipher text 
produced result 
block ciphers mostly used 
encrypting large data 
wellknown widely 
used symmetric ciphers block ciphers 
include, example, 
data encryption standard, des, 
triple tests recent 
advanced encryption standard aes 
block ciphers first components in 
designing many cryptographic protocols 
block ciphers implemented 
in different modes operation, 
offering different levels 
protection performance 
common examples cipher 
feedback mode cfb, 
cipher block chaining mode cbc, 
electronic code block mode, ecb 
we going to cover 
this mode in this course 
however, you read 
internet if you interested 
breaking a cryptographic system 
involves finding plain text without 
decryption key 
attack models a cyber system 
depend amount information 
that is available attacker 
based this main attack models 
classified four categories 
is always assumed that encryption 
algorithm is known attacker 
in a ciphertextonly attack, 
attacker access 
to encrypted content 
in a knownplaintext attack, 
attacker access to 
plain text ciphertext pairs 
correspond to 
in a chosen plaintext attack, attacker 
access to encryption process 
is able to generate corresponding 
cipher text a chosen plaintext 
in a chosen ciphertext attack, 
attacker access to 
decryption process 
is able to generate corresponding 
plaintext a chosen cipher text 
in attack models, 
ultimate goal is to 
find secret key 
in addition to mentioned 
attack models, 
if there is information available, 
attacker to try 
possible combinations keys 
until correct one is found 
this kind attack is known 
an exhaustive key search attack 
a brute force attack 
cipher system considered 
perfect if exhaustive search is 
way to find key 
designing cryptographic algorithms, 
time that 
a message needs to in encrypted 
form taken account 
this period is called a cover period 
example, in a banks transaction 
a message needs to in 
encrypted form a few seconds 
until reaches receiver side 
while in a database, a file needs 
to kept in a encrypted form 
a longer period time 
design a cyber system 
always ensure that type attack to 
successfully find key, would take 
longer time given cover period 
in this lesson we learned 
basic concepts cryptography 
we also got familiar different 
types encryption algorithms, 
specifically, we learned 
symmetric key cipher systems 
in video lectures, we will learn 
public key cryptography
