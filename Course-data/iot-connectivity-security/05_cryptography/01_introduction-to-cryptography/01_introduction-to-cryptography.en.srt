00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,867
[SOUND] Hello, welcome back to the online
course on web connectivity and

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:12,060
security in cyber physical systems.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,095
This lesson starts a module on
a cryptographic solutions for

4
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:18,410
cyber physical systems.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,289
It is the last module of the course.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,440
In this video lecture,
we will look into basic concepts and

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,770
techniques of cryptography.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,425
Cryptography is a scientific and
engineering field which develops and

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:36,340
analyzes mathematical techniques for so
many different information, security, and

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,985
privacy issues such as confidentiality,
data integrity,

11
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:44,800
entity authentication and
data origin authentication.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
Cryptography has a long and
fascinating history.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,550
Egyptians used some kind of encryption
in their messages about 4,000 years ago.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,810
In the 20th century,
during the World War I and

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,540
II, cryptography was used to protect
sensitive war related information.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,960
Even though the usage
of modern cryptography

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,920
originally focus on military applications,
today it's widely use for

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
protecting our digital information
in general, everywhere.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,631
This development began in 1960's and
has been boosted by the proliferation

20
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:30,722
of computers and communication
systems during the last decades.

21
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:38,106
The main goal of cryptography
is to hide and protect sensitive

22
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:44,560
information which is called a plaintext,
from the adversaries or attackers.

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,980
You can imagine that you protect your
belongings inside a suitcase with

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,640
a padlock.

25
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,140
The idea is that one needs
the key of the padlock to get

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,820
the stuff out of the suitcase.

27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,890
The cyber system essentially
works in the same way.

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,270
The plain text, is encrypted,

29
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,190
using a cryptographic algorithm,
which corresponds to the padlock.

30
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,720
The algorithm takes the plain text and
encryption key as input, and

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,580
as a result, a cipher text is generated.

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,850
The cipher text is a new form or
combination of the plain text.

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,730
It is not readable by a human or
a computer without decrypting it.

34
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,960
And therefore, the cipher text can
be safely sent to another party.

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,300
On the receiver side, if the receiver
has the right decryption key, he or

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,860
she will be able to decrypt the cipher
text to discover the original message.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,540
The secrecy of a cipher system is highly
dependent on the secrecy of the key.

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,710
So, the exchange of the decryption key
should be done in a very secured way.

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,034
From the attackers perspective, the main
challenge is to determine the plain text

40
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,451
from a cypher text
without knowing the key.

41
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:21,649
The decryption key does not have to
always be the same as the encryption key.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,530
There are two types of cipher systems,
a symmetric key cipher system and

43
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,760
an asymmetric key or
public key cipher system.

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,210
In a symmetric key cipher system,

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,130
the decryption key is identical
to the encryption key.

46
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,900
Or can be easily obtained
from the encryption key.

47
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,160
In this case, there is a need for
a secure channel for key exchange.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,770
In an asymmetric key or
public key cypher system,

49
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,310
the encryption key is not
the same as the decryption key.

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,930
It is computation or in principle and

51
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,190
practical to obtain the decryption
key from the encryption key.

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,140
In this case theirs a pair
of different keys, one for

53
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,640
encryption and the other for decryption.

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,020
The encryption key is publicly available,
so

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,339
everyone who has the public
key can encrypt the message.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,970
The decryption key is secret and
is referred to as the private key.

57
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,510
So only the one who has the private
key can decrypt the message.

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,830
Establishing a public key cipher system
is computationally more complex and

59
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,930
requires more resources
than symmetric encryption.

60
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,390
Therefore, it is usually used for
shorter messages.

61
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,670
In practice, a public key system
is used for encrypting and

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,890
transferring the encryption
key of a symmetric key system.

63
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,140
Symmetric ciphers are far further divided
into stream ciphers and block ciphers.

64
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,890
In a stream cipher, the plaintext is
encrypted bit by bit or byte by byte.

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,899
For simplicity,
we call this unit of encryption a digit.

66
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,030
So instead of one single key,

67
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,798
the stream cipher requires a stream
of keys to encrypt every digit.

68
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:29,670
In this model, the cipher text stream is

69
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,710
calculated as an exclusive or
a modular to addition of

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,420
every digit in the plaintext stream with
the corresponding digit in the key stream.

71
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,100
The same key stream is then used for

72
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,070
decryption on the receiver
side in the similar manner.

73
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,910
The key streams are generated as random or
pseudo-random digits.

74
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,030
So, the security of a stream
cipher is highly dependent

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,230
on the key stream generation process.

76
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,840
Stream ciphers are small and fast, and

77
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,100
that's why they are suitable for
embedded resource constrain devices.

78
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,640
In contrast to a stream cipher,
a block cipher

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,620
uses a single key to encrypt fixed
size block of plain text at a time.

80
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,570
Blocks of cipher text
are produced as the result.

81
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Block ciphers are mostly used for
encrypting large data.

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,550
The most of the well-known and widely
used symmetric ciphers are block ciphers.

83
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,089
These include, for example,
the Data Encryption Standard, or DES,

84
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,710
triple tests and the more recent
Advanced Encryption Standard or AES.

85
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,120
Block ciphers are first as components in
designing many cryptographic protocols.

86
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,030
The block ciphers can be implemented
in different modes of operation,

87
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,960
offering different levels of
protection and performance.

88
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,292
Common examples are The cipher
feedback mode or CFB,

89
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:17,320
the cipher block chaining mode or CBC,
and the electronic code block mode, ECB.

90
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,950
We are not going to cover
this mode in this course.

91
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,914
However, you can read more about them
on the internet if you are interested.

92
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:34,085
Breaking a cryptographic system
involves finding the plain text without

93
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,540
the decryption key.

94
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,070
The attack models of a cyber system
depend on the amount of information

95
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,860
that is available for the attacker.

96
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,820
Based on this the main attack models
are classified four categories.

97
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,178
It is always assumed that the encryption
algorithm is known by the attacker.

98
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:59,220
In a ciphertext-only attack,

99
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,978
the attacker has access only
to the encrypted content.

100
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:07,880
In a known-plaintext attack,
the attacker has access to

101
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,350
some plain text ciphertext pairs
which correspond to each other.

102
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,760
In a chosen plaintext attack, the attacker
has access to the encryption process and

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,770
is able to generate the corresponding
cipher text for a chosen plaintext.

104
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,970
In a chosen ciphertext attack,

105
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,680
the attacker has access to
the decryption process and

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,830
is able to generate the corresponding
plaintext for a chosen cipher text.

107
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,702
In all of these attack models,

108
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:40,582
the ultimate goal is to
find out the secret key.

109
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:46,248
In addition to the mentioned
attack models,

110
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:51,147
if there is no such information available,
the attacker has to try all

111
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:55,560
possible combinations of keys
until the correct one is found.

112
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,130
This kind of attack is known as
an Exhaustive Key Search attack or

113
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,240
a Brute force attack.

114
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,322
The Cipher System can not be considered
perfect if the exhaustive search is

115
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:11,046
the only way to find the key.

116
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:17,501
When designing cryptographic algorithms,
the time that

117
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:22,020
a message needs to be in the encrypted
form should be taken into account.

118
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,390
This period is called a Cover Period.

119
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,790
For example, in a banks transaction
a message needs to be in

120
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,919
the encrypted form for a few seconds
until it reaches the receiver side.

121
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,240
While in a database, a file needs
to be kept in a encrypted form for

122
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,590
a longer period of time.

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,210
The design of a cyber system should
always ensure that any type of attack to

124
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,030
successfully find the key, would take
longer time Than the given cover period.

125
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,910
In this lesson we learned about
basic concepts of cryptography.

126
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,370
We also got familiar with different
types of encryption algorithms, and

127
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,930
more specifically, we learned about
symmetric key cipher systems.

128
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,370
In other video lectures, we will learn
more about public key cryptography.

129
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,044
And its usage for
securing digital communication.

130
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:22,319
