00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,650
[MUSIC]
>> Here we are with the last video

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,490
of the last module of our
introductory course on

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,390
particle physics. 

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,621
And in this last video, we will 
go into some more depth

5
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:28,559
on the preceding discussion of
dark energy and dark matter. 

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,186
To do that, we have invited ourselves 
to a colleague from the 

7
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:37,440
theoretical physics department 
of University of Geneva. 

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,630
Let me present to you Ruth Durrer,
professor of theoretical physics 

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,880
who is a specialist on cosmology,

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,740
the physics subject which remains most

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,780
concerned with these two phenomena,
thus far inaccessible

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,300
to experimentation at 
existing accelerators. 

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,060
So, at the end of this video, 
you will understand a bit better how

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,680
dark matter and dark energy act on 
the universe that surrounds us. 

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,620
So, Ruth,

16
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,000
I think there is little doubt on
the existence of dark matter, is there?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Or am I mistaken, are there
still people who believe that

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,340
dark matter does not exist?

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,920
>> Yes, there are such people. 

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,820
Dark matter, as you have already heard 
in the preceding videos,

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,050
has been confirmed by only one
interaction, which is gravity, and by

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,290
no other, so they ask 
the question: should our

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,720
theory of gravitation – to discover
dark matter, one only needs 

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,060
Newtonian gravitation – should it be
modified at large distance scales.

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,820
There are people who have tried that,
and who were able to explain, for example,

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,650
the fact that the rotational curve of 
galaxies does not descend 

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:15,570
like one would expect, if
gravitation obeys Kepler’s law. 

28
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,910
But even if one can modify

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,350
gravitation such that one obtains
flat rotational curves also,

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,310
there is still a lot more
confirmation for the existence of dark matter. 

31
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,085
>> Like gravitational lenses…
>> Exactly.

32
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:32,925
>> …the motion of galaxies,

33
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,756
and their interactions, like the 
Bullet Cluster for example…

34
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,342
>> Exactly. 

35
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:41,515
And if you want to explain all that by
modifying the theory of gravitation, 

36
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:46,025
you can for example do this
with what is called TeVeS,

37
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:51,865
but it is a horribly complicated theory and
one makes hypotheses which are much more

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,400
complex and non-minimal, 
than to just add a particle. 

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,764
So, I would say that 99% of 

40
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:08,580
the scientists are 
convinced that dark matter

41
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,770
is what it takes and not a 
modified theory of gravity. 

42
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,030
>> And in that case, there should be
a particle which constitutes 

43
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,400
dark matter, and one should be able to see
its interactions, either among themselves,

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,330
as we try with AMS, or with normal matter
as out colleagues

45
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,860
try in Zurich, for example, 
in their underground experiments, or

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:43,150
by the artificial creation of this matter,
at the LHC for example. 

47
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,170
So, up to now, we have not
succeeded to do so,

48
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,800
but it is never too late to try. 

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,590
So, if such a particle existed,

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,140
what would be the implication 
for the Standard Model of

51
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:06,210
the existence of an additional particle,
which we need to explain this, don’t we?

52
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,710
>> Of course,

53
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,680
such a particle is beyond the 
Standard Model of particle physics

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,260
but there are plenty of hypotheses 
on the existence of such a particle. 

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,932
For example, in supersymmetry. 

56
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:25,040
one expects that there be a
stable supersymmetric particle.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,930
Or one can add a heavy neutrino,
to explain,

58
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,060
for example, the generation of quarks and
leptons in the universe

59
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,610
and this could, at the same time, 
also play the role of dark matter. 

60
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,150
A low mass neutrino does not work,
because it has too large velocities

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,660
to be confined in galaxies, etc. 

62
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,445
So, we need a particle
with a minimal mass of at least

63
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,905
some kiloelectronvolts. 

64
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:04,835
Standard candidates rather have
some hundred GeV of mass. 

65
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:11,110
But what is the interaction of 
this particle with normal matter?

66
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,550
Of course, we do not know. 

67
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,600
If it is comparable to weak interactions,
in the coming years

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,050
one should discover it either at LHC,
or with direct or indirect 

69
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,530
interactions. But if the interaction
is much weaker,

70
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,780
if we had, for example 
a gravitino, which interacts via the 

71
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,020
gravitational force, we will not discover it
by these experiments. 

72
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,290
>> But we are still in good hope
that during our own active lifetime

73
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,240
we will know of what is consists. 

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,785
>> Yes, I do hope so. 

75
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:52,165
It is one of these problems, which are
with us since 70-80 years.

76
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:52,805
>> Since Zwicky, yes. 

77
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,575
>> Yeah. 
>> So, on the contrary,

78
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:59,945
I have much less hope as far as
dark energy is concerned, no? 

79
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:07,575
So, can you share with us your 
vision of dark matter. 

80
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,628
First of all, according to you, what is it?

81
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:14,180
>> I don’t know.

82
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,260
This is the honest answer, we must 
leave somethings to do

83
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,660
for young people, to explain to us. 

84
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,550
I don’t know what dark energy is. 

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,730
So, I can tell you that current
data are in good agreement with the

86
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,360
assumption, that dark energy is
just a cosmological constant.

87
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,550
But I will talk a little about how

88
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,620
one has discovered the existence 
of this dark energy. 

89
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,580
One has seen that the universe is 
currently in an accelerated expansion, and not

90
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,550
as one had thought, that due to gravitation
the expansion would slow down more and more.

91
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,480
In fact, one has found that,
since a while,

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,410
this slowing down has reversed
and has become an acceleration. 

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,130
And this acceleration,

94
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,770
one can explain it, if there is a component
practically with negative gravity. 

95
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,820
So, we need, for example, something which has

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,360
a very strong pressure, a 
negative pressure. 

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,150
Negative energy density is not
possible

98
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,520
according to the Friedmann equations

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,470
which are a consequence of the 
Einstein equations…

100
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,590
>> Well, we have scratched the surface
of these equations a little bit earlier in the course,

101
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:41,016
so, if you are no more familiar with this,

102
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:47,310
please watch again the previous video, which 
talks just about the Friedmann equation.

103
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,230
So, if the famous lambda
is the only thing which exists,

104
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:59,180
this would be a property of our universe, which was 
created together with our universe, wouldn’t it?

105
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,950
So, by chance, well,
it has the value it has,

106
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,750
and we must live with it, no?

107
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,170
>> It is more complicated than that. 

108
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,800
The problem is that this lambda,
this cosmological constant,

109
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
must have changed, for example, 

110
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,930
if the interactions of the universe
passed through a phase transition.

111
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,610
>> Yes.

112
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,770
Like inflation, to just name one. 

113
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,120
>> For example, during inflation. 

114
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,220
And during that transition,
the cosmological constant has changed

115
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,265
its value, which was 10 to the power 120

116
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:38,765
greater that the value 
we measure today. 

117
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:44,435
So, this value requires an
enormous fine tuning. 

118
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,675
>> I.e. of the initial conditions
to get there. 

119
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,955
>> And most of all this
is not what we call

120
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:54,760
a « natural » fine tuning

121
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,790
in the sense that in 
field theory

122
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,770
this constant is not 
protected from corrections.

123
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,750
If one modifies the theory a litle bit,
this constant changes enormously, etc. 

124
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,630
So, from the point of view of
a quantum field theory,

125
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,550
such a constant is very, very 
unnatural, unexpected, bizarre. 

126
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,800
>> So, all of this requires effectively

127
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,055
that his field is a quantum field, no?

128
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:30,360
Is it really necessary 
that this be so,

129
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,500
or could it not simply be
a classical field,

130
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,960
which does not have a quantum representation,
which does not exist

131
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,630
in a theory at small scales,
does not exist or is not necessary?

132
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,760
>> Well, the cosmological constant 
itself is not a field, but it is

133
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,020
an effective constant, which comes from
the quantisation of all other fields. 

134
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,810
And that the electron is well
represented by a quantum field,

135
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,650
or the quarks, I believe that you
have discussed that in your course. 

136
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,970
So you cannot say that at very small scales,
this is not the case. 

137
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,790
I would even say that usually
all fields, even effective ones,

138
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,980
even non-fundamental ones, can be
described by quantum fields,

139
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,260
that they exhibit a quantum nature
if one talks about very small excitations. 

140
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,270
>> Like phonons in a solid,
for example. 

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,520
>> Exactly, like phonons
in crystals. 

142
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,070
But here, we have two explanations, which are

143
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,530
a little bit more satisfactory, but more
complicated and also not very attractive.

144
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,020
One is, one adds a scalar field,

145
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,150
which is not constant but nearly constant. 

146
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,140
And with that, if the field
is sufficiently constant,

147
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,190
one can explain dark energy.

148
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,440
But the difference to a cosmological
constant becomes more and more

149
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,610
diffuse there.

150
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,635
Another one is that one changes the
theory of gravitation at large scales. 

151
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:13,655
You see, one has tested Einstein’s
gravitation for distances beyond

152
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:17,435
a tenth of a millimetre,

153
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:21,505
a hundredth of a millimetre, 
up to the size of galaxies, 

154
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:26,590
and maybe at the distance scale of the universe
one must add modifications. 

155
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,370
This can be done, there are modifications,
for example concerning the graviton,

156
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,800
which can have a very small mass.

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,350
This mass must also 
be fine tuned.

158
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,530
But at least the quantum corrections,
if one develops a quantum

159
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,530
theory of gravitation, are small,
they are logarithmic corrections,

160
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,525
which do not blow up everything, when one

161
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,255
describes the facts by a quantum theory,
like the cosmological constant does. 

162
00:11:55,255 --> 00:12:00,545
>> I believe that it is, however, correct to
say that this form of energy is not

163
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:05,625
easily amenable to human experimentation, is it?

164
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,805
This is a phenomenon, which really only exists 
at a cosmological scale,

165
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:13,180
and which stays confined to this domain.

166
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,570
>> If it is a cosmological constant,

167
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,290
it is accessible only by
gravitational forces. 

168
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,870
All other forces are not 
sensitive to a constant 

169
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,910
difference in energy.

170
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,520
But, if it is not a 
cosmological constant,

171
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,600
but if it is a modification,
lets say, take this example,

172
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,030
a modification of gravity,
one should be able to also see it

173
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,880
on other scales,
with very high precision experiments, etc.

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,820
Or, if, for example, the 
graviton had a mass, 

175
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,828
this would mean that the graviton 
has five helicities and not only two. 

176
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:56,950
Ans maybe with certain experiments,
still gravitational ones,

177
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,890
one would be able to excite these other 
helicities of the graviton.

178
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,870
So, there would be this other
possibility of see that. 

179
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,580
>> Experimental possibility. 

180
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,340
>> Yes.

181
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,550
But I would say also, however,

182
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,850
that a cosmological experiment is
a human experiment. 

183
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,800
So, this is not to scale,
but the scale

184
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
tested at LHC is as far from the
human scale as the cosmological scale. 

185
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,830
>> There, I admit, that is true. 

186
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,430
>> You agree, Martin.

187
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,570
>> OK.

188
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,650
So, thank you very much for this interview.

189
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,830
I think that it is very important also

190
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,500
to indicate like an open window
towards the future of our profession. 

191
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,060
Because the course does not stop here.

192
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,378
It invites you to stay interested
in the forthcoming

193
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:54,520
experimental as well as 
theoretical progress in the field. 

194
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,270
So, I invite you to have eyes and ears
open,

195
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,830
for what will happen, and for what
will probably again revolutionise our field 

196
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,190
in the coming decades. 

197
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,966
Thank you for your attention. 

198
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,969
