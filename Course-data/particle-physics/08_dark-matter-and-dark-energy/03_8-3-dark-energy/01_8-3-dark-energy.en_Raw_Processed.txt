in this eighth module, we discussing 
two mysterious components universe 
dark matter dark 
in this third video, 
well review dark energy 
following this video, 
you will know we know this 
new form omnipresent energy 
existence is still a matter debate 
main 
properties dark energy 
to understand signs 
presence dark energy, 
we must visit expansion 
mechanism universe 
in late s, 
hubble observed that line spectra 
distant galaxies red shifted 
this is doppler effect 
association recession 
velocity v 
wavelength lambda prime observed 
earth is offset respect to lambda, 
wavelength in rest frame emitter 
red shift parameter is called z, 
equal to lambdalambda 
using redshift to measure velocity 
v, magnitude an estimator 
distance r to emitter, one empirically 
observes hubbles law, v hr 
recessional velocities are, 
thus, proportional to distance 
a coefficient called 
hubble constant h 
hubbles law corresponds to a uniform 
expansion distances including 
wavelength a factor rt 
r is current scale 
is today 
without loss generality, we 
normalize distance to r 
r becomes a 
generic distance scale 
hubble constant is given 
relative rate change 
in r, rdotr 
contrary to name, h is constant 
decelerating effect 
gravity expansion universe 
accelerated effect dark energy 
today, we find h roughly equal to 
kilometers per second per mega parsec, 
an accuracy a few percent, 
although various methods 
determining this constant, 
give somewhat different results, 
shown in plot right 
one expresses large, 
astronomical distances in parsec 
one parsec roughly equals 
kilometers, is 
defined distance mean 
radius earth orbit around sun 
subtends an angle one arc second 
evolution 
universe is dominated action 
gravity since early in history 
follows solution equations 
describing general relativity 
a homogeneous isotropic 
distribution matter large scales, 
is described friedmann equation 
first term containing newtons 
constant gn mass energy 
density rho matter describes 
decelerating action gravity 
constants k 
lambda determine asymptotic evolution 
cosmological constant lambda 
potentially corresponds to an energy 
associated a vacuum, 
socalled dark energy 
now, we neglect this term, 
although may dominate 
evolution universe today 
if youre interested in motivation 
behind an equation, 
we recommend small 
calculation in video a 
constant k 
corresponds to an intrinsic curvature 
space generated total energy 
there three distinct cases 
k , this corresponds 
to a total positive energy 
this case describes a socalled open 
universe that extends to infinity 
rdot tending towards one 
large in this case, 
curvature term kr is positive 
k , corresponds to 
a negative total energy, a closed universe 
negative curvature extends 
to a maximum radius shrinks 
special case, 
k is that a 
scalled flat universe, 
kinetic 
potential energy equal, total 
energy thus curvature zero 
rate expansion tends towards 
rdot long term 
an inventory contents 
universe today shows a remarkable 
density similar to density 
corresponding to k 
so we neglect this term 
integrating friedmann equation 
special case k lambda 
in non relativistic approximation, a 
simplified expansion equation is obtained 
todays value hubbles constant, 
we derive t, age 
universe, 
corresponds to gy 
this is well edge 
order subject we know 
varies between 
gy 
obviously, a negative k a positive 
value cosmological constant 
lambda would lead to an increased 
prediction friedmann equation 
since k is roughly equal to , 
we need a substantial amount dark 
energy to obtain a reasonable age prediction 
k cosmological constant 
lambda equal to , friedmann 
equation acquires last term 
corresponds to a constant energy 
density associated vacuum 
this corresponding energy density 
adds to matter density shown 
in second equation 
considering equation state, 
we see that this energy exerts an internal 
pressure expansion universe 
shown third equation 
if lambda is larger zero, 
this pressure is negative 
accelerates expansion opposing 
decelerating action gravity 
to understand we measure expansion 
velocity in past, we must remember 
that photons reaching us a large 
distance issued in a distant past 
observing red shift 
a characteristic line, 
we measure velocity 
emitter in past 
compared to that a closer 
source photons emitted recently 
this, 
we need an estimate distance z, 
is independent red shift 
observed flux f, photons, 
converted luminosity distance, 
dl, if emitted luminosity l is known 
luminosity distance is related 
to astronomical magnitude m, 
numerical conversion 
given in this formula 
non relativistic recessional velocity, 
we v roughly equal to z 
a constant hubble parameter, 
we thus expect a relationship 
mz a b logz, between 
magnitude m red shift z 
provided one identify a standard kind 
source constant emitted luminosity 
l, one find a sample mi 
sufficiently different zi 
test this proportionality 
thermonuclear explosions type a 
supernova a standard candle 
brightness derived 
properties light curve, 
ie photon flux time 
measurement results shown here, 
log red shift, ie, 
recessional velocity ordinate, 
magnitude abscissa 
turns out, that 
large distances, recession 
velocity is always less is 
expected a lambda equal to zero 
expansion universe 
is accelerating 
is faster in past 
this discovery, 
perlmutter, schmidt 
riess received 
physics nobel prize 
a word caution is required here 
methodology providing evidence 
dark energy is continuously 
scrutiny 
in a recent paper, subir sarkar collaborators 
analyzed a larger sample sources 
this plot shows difference 
measurements 
straight line in 
magnitude red shift relation that weve 
shown in previous slide 
is clear that spread data 
is comparable if greater 
expected effect dark energy 
indicated blue line 
dark energy corresponds 
to dashed red line 
th authors conclude that a universe 
without dark energy is improbable 
order 
is impossible 
universe today therefore probably 
consists dark matter, 
dark energy totalling 
this leaves place 
ordinary matter 
density dark energy is low 
order 
kilograms per cubic meter, 
that total solar system to 
orbit pluto contains a negligible 
amount compared to solar mass 
since distribution is uniform, 
dark energy dominates evolution 
universe cosmological scale 
different forms dark 
energy proposed 
energy density, filling space 
homogeneously, like a cosmological constant 
lambda custom designed scalar fields 
generate this effect dynamically 
a indepth 
discussion dark energy, 
i refer to article ruth durer 
cited bottom this page 
this, we almost concluded 
tour subatomic physics 
if we compare to reductionist program 
particle physics, that is to understand 
complete universe based 
microscopic properties, 
we realize that we understood a lot 
a small fraction whats there 
many parameters standard model, 
masses 
higgs couplings, coupling 
constants to forces, mixing angles, 
etc ought to fixed a 
profound layer theory 
unknown ingredients, dark matter 
side matter, dark energy 
inflation side forces, 
clearly indicate that much 
universe remains to discovered 
and, in addition, 
even to integrate gravity 
microscopic model 
universe is far clear 
this leaves enough work 
future generations physicists, 
you 
in last video this module, 
we interview professor ruth durrer
