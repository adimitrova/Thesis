2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,448
In this eighth module, we are discussing
two mysterious components of the universe

3
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,400
which are dark matter and dark.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,010
And in this third video,
we'll review dark energy.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,340
After following this video,
you will know how we know about this

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,780
new form of omnipresent energy and why its
existence is still a matter of debate and

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,819
what are the main
properties of dark energy.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,700
To understand the signs of
presence of dark energy,

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,660
we must visit the expansion
mechanism of the universe.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,250
In the late 1920s,

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,390
Hubble observed that the line spectra
of distant galaxies are red shifted.

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,770
This is because of the Doppler effect
association with the recession

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,670
velocity v.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,430
The wavelength lambda prime observed on
Earth is offset with respect to lambda,

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,980
the wavelength in the rest frame of the emitter.
The red shift parameter is called z,

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,500
equal to ∆lambda/lambda.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,080
Using the redshift to measure the velocity
v, and the magnitude as an estimator of

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,830
the distance r to the emitter, one empirically
observes Hubble’s law, v = Hr.

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,110
Recessional velocities are,
thus, proportional to distance

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,730
with a coefficient called
the Hubble constant H.

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,960
Hubble's law corresponds to a uniform
expansion of all distances including

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,220
all wavelength by a factor r(t)

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,110
where r_0 is the current scale at
t = t_0 which is today.

24
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,580
Without loss of generality, we can
normalize any distance to r_0 = 1.

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,082
R then becomes a
generic distance scale.

26
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:48,888
The Hubble constant is given
by the relative rate of change

27
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:51,590
in R, R_dot/R.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,250
Contrary to its name, H is not constant
because of the decelerating effect of

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,340
gravity on the expansion of the Universe
and the accelerated effect of dark energy.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,720
Today, we find H_0 roughly equal to 70
kilometers per second per mega parsec,

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,920
with an accuracy of a few percent,

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,130
although the various methods for
determining this constant,

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,410
give somewhat different results,
as shown in the plot on the right.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,960
One expresses large,
astronomical distances in parsec.

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,600
One parsec roughly equals 
31 10^12 kilometers, and is

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,570
defined as the distance at which the mean
radius of the Earth orbit around the sun

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,250
subtends an angle of one arc second.
The evolution

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,530
of the Universe is dominated by the action
of gravity since early in its history.

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,110
It follows the solution of equations
describing general relativity.

40
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,570
For a homogeneous and the isotropic
distribution of matter at large scales,

41
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,330
it is described by the Friedmann equation.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,440
The first term containing Newton's
constant G_N and the mass or energy

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,190
density rho of matter describes
the decelerating action of gravity.

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,050
The constants K and
Lambda determine the asymptotic evolution.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,460
The cosmological constant Lambda
potentially corresponds to an energy

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,000
associated with a vacuum,
the so-called dark energy.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
For now, we neglect this term,

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,840
although it may dominate
the evolution of the Universe today.

49
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,030
If you're interested in the motivation
behind such an equation,

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,150
we recommend the small
calculation in video 8.3a.

51
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,470
The constant K

52
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,320
corresponds to an intrinsic curvature
of space generated by its total energy.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,705
There are three distinct cases.

54
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:48,530
For K = -1, this corresponds
to a total positive energy.

55
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,580
This case describes a so-called open
universe that extends to infinity

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,540
with R-dot tending towards one for
large t. In this case,

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,940
the curvature term -K/R^2 is positive.

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,820
For K = +1, corresponds to
a negative total energy, a closed universe

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,330
with negative curvature which extends
to a maximum radius and then shrinks.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,390
The special case,
K=0 is that of a 

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,940
s0-called flat universe,
where the kinetic and

62
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,280
potential energy are equal, the total
energy and thus the curvature are zero.

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,730
The rate of expansion tends towards 
R-dot = 0 on the long term.

64
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,840
An inventory of the contents of
the Universe today shows a remarkable

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,934
density similar to the density
corresponding to K = 0.

66
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,489
So we neglect this term.

67
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:48,275
Integrating the Friedmann equation for
the special case K = Lambda = 0 and

68
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:53,349
in non relativistic approximation, a
simplified expansion equation is obtained.

69
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,322
From today's value of Hubble's constant,
we can derive t_0, the age of

70
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:02,835
the Universe, which
corresponds to 9.4 Gy.

71
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,370
This is well below the edge
of the order subject we know

72
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,915
about which varies between 11 and
14 Gy.

73
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:15,082
Obviously, a negative K or a positive
value of the cosmological constant

74
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:20,610
Lambda would lead to an increased t_0 
prediction by the Friedmann equation.

75
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,420
Since K is roughly equal to 0,

76
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,510
we need a substantial amount of dark
energy to obtain a reasonable age prediction.

77
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:32,470
For K = 0 and the cosmological constant

78
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,220
Lambda not equal to 0, the Friedmann
equation acquires the last term.

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,520
It corresponds to a constant energy
density associated with the vacuum itself.

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,940
This corresponding energy density
adds to the matter density as shown

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,690
in the second equation.

82
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,880
Considering the equation of state,
we see that this energy exerts an internal

83
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,290
pressure on the expansion of the Universe
as shown by the third equation.

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,811
If Lambda is larger than zero,
this pressure is negative and

85
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:03,743
accelerates the expansion opposing
the decelerating action of gravity.

86
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:10,950
To understand how we measure the expansion
velocity in the past, we must remember

87
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,370
that the photons reaching us from a large
distance were issued in a distant past.

88
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,130
By observing the red shift
of a characteristic line,

89
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,020
we can measure the velocity
of the emitter in the past.

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,220
And it can be compared to that of a closer
source from photons emitted more recently.

91
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,950
For this,
we need an estimate of the distance z,

92
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,820
which is independent of the red shift.

93
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,820
The observed flux F, of photons, can be
converted into the luminosity distance,

94
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,230
D_L, if the emitted luminosity L is known.

95
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,936
The luminosity distance is related
to the astronomical magnitude m,

96
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:48,715
by the numerical conversion
given in this formula.

97
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:56,092
For non relativistic recessional velocity,
we have v roughly equal to z.

98
00:06:56,092 --> 00:07:01,360
For a constant Hubble parameter,
we thus expect a relationship

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,510
m(z) = a + b log10(z), between
the magnitude m and the red shift z.

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,450
Provided one can identify a standard kind
of source with constant emitted luminosity

101
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,550
L, one can then find a sample of m_i
at sufficiently different z_i and

102
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,950
test this proportionality.

103
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,290
Thermonuclear explosions of type 1A
supernova are such a standard candle.

104
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,150
Their brightness can be derived from
the properties of the light curve,

105
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,390
i.e. the photon flux over time.

106
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,580
Measurement results are shown here,
with the log of the red shift, ie,

107
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,590
the recessional velocity as the ordinate,
and the magnitude as the abscissa.

108
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,220
Turns out, that for
large distances, the recession of

109
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,060
velocity is always less than what is
expected for a Lambda equal to zero.

110
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,170
The expansion of the universe
is accelerating.

111
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,903
It is now faster than it was in the past.

112
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:58,507
For this discovery,
Perlmutter, Schmidt and

113
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:02,751
Riess have received the 2011
physics Nobel Prize.

114
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,690
But a word of caution is required here.

115
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,000
The methodology providing evidence for

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,020
dark energy is continuously
under scrutiny.

117
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,320
In a recent paper, Subir Sarkar and his collaborators
have analyzed a larger sample of sources.

118
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
This plot shows the difference of
the measurements 

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,730
from the the straight line in the
magnitude red shift relation that we've

120
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,800
shown in the previous slide.

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,740
It is clear that the spread of the data
is comparable if not greater than

122
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,200
the expected effect of dark energy
indicated by the blue line.

123
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,780
No dark energy corresponds
to the dashed red line.

124
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,428
Th authors conclude that a Universe
without dark energy is improbable of

125
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:46,270
the order of 0.3% but
it is not impossible.

126
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:56,180
The universe today therefore probably
consists of 26.8% Dark Matter,

127
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,356
68.3% Dark Energy totalling 95.1%.

128
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:05,750
This leaves place for no
more than 4.9% of ordinary matter.

129
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,560
The density of dark energy is very low.

130
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,130
It's of the order of 
6 10^-27 kilograms per cubic meter,

131
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,980
such that the total Solar system up to the
orbit of Pluto contains only a negligible

132
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,180
amount compared to the Solar mass.

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,120
But since the distribution is uniform,

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,240
dark energy dominates the evolution of
the Universe at the cosmological scale.

135
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,960
Different forms of dark
energy have been proposed.

136
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,380
And energy density, filling space
homogeneously, like a cosmological constant

137
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,380
Lambda or custom designed scalar of fields
which generate this effect dynamically.

138
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,610
For a more in-depth
discussion of dark energy,

139
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,060
I refer to the article by Ruth Durer
cited at the bottom of this page.

140
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,010
With this, we have almost concluded
our tour of subatomic physics.

141
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,420
If we compare to the reductionist program
of particle physics, that is to understand

142
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,650
the complete Universe based on
its microscopic properties,

143
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,790
we realize that we have understood a lot
about a small fraction of what's there.

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,950
The many parameters of the standard model,
the masses or

145
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,530
the Higgs couplings, the coupling
constants to forces, mixing angles,

146
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,600
etc ought to be fixed by a more
profound layer of theory.

147
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,600
Unknown ingredients, dark matter on
the side of matter, dark energy and

148
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,890
inflation on the side of forces,

149
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,199
clearly indicate that much of
the Universe remains to be discovered.

150
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,350
And, in addition,
even how to integrate gravity

151
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,160
into our microscopic model of
the Universe is far from clear.

152
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,540
This leaves enough work for
future generations of physicists,

153
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,460
and why not you?

154
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,243
In the last video of this module,

155
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:49,059
we interview Professor Ruth Durrer
about her vision of dark energy.
