00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,158
To motivate the Friedmann equation,

3
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,163
we are going to consider
the movement of mass m

4
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:20,280
at a cosmological
distance R from us.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,820
At cosmological scales,
the Universe is isotopic and homogenous,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:35,750
such that the test mass will be attracted
by a mass M, which is 

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,629
4π/3 r^3 times the average mass
density rho of the Universe.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,264
Newton's Law gives us that
m times the acceleration

9
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:52,247
of the test mass is equal
to minus Newton's constant

10
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:58,440
times the test mass times
the mass M divided by R^2.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,080
We can reorder this equation to have
all terms on the left of the equal sign.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,910
Let me integrate this second equation.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,700
We get that

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,280
1/2 n times the test mass velocity
squared minus Newton's constant

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,590
times the product of the two masses
divided by R is a constant of motion.

16
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,790
This is equivalent to saying that the
kinetic energy plus the potential energy

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,630
is a constant of motion.

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,740
You can easily verify that this is correct
by taking the time derivative of this

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,247
result.

20
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:37,746
Now, if you set the constant of
integration equal to -1/2 k and

21
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:41,680
introduce our result for M,
then we get this equation.

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,225
If we now multiply both sides by 2/R^2,
we get that (R-dot/R)^2,

23
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:54,221
which is in fact the Hubble constant
squared, is equal to 8π Newton's

24
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:58,775
constant divided by 3,
minus k/R^2.

25
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:03,555
Now we can still add to this a
cosmological constant as Einstein did and

26
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,804
obtain thus the complete
Friedmann equation.
