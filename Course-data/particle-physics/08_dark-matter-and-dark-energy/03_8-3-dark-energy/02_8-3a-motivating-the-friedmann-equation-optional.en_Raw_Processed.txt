to motivate friedmann equation, 
we going to consider 
movement mass m 
a cosmological 
distance r us 
cosmological scales, 
universe is isotopic homogenous, 
that test mass will attracted 
a mass m, is 
r times average mass 
density rho universe 
newtons law gives us that 
m times acceleration 
test mass is equal 
to minus newtons constant 
times test mass times 
mass m divided r 
we reorder this equation to 
terms left equal sign 
let integrate this second equation 
we get that 
n times test mass velocity 
squared minus newtons constant 
times product two masses 
divided r is a constant motion 
this is equivalent to saying that 
kinetic energy plus potential energy 
is a constant motion 
you easily verify that this is correct 
taking time derivative this 
result 
now, if you set constant 
integration equal to k 
introduce result m, 
we get this equation 
if we multiply sides r, 
we get that rdotr, 
is in fact hubble constant 
squared, is equal to newtons 
constant divided , 
minus kr 
we still add to this a 
cosmological constant einstein 
obtain thus complete 
friedmann equation
