in
this
eighth
module
,
we
are
discussing
two
mysterious
components
of
the
universe
which
are
dark
matter
and
dark
.
and
in
this
third
video
,
we
'll
review
dark
energy
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
how
we
know
about
this
new
form
of
omnipresent
energy
and
why
its
existence
is
still
a
matter
of
debate
and
what
are
the
main
properties
of
dark
energy
.
to
understand
the
signs
of
presence
of
dark
energy
,
we
must
visit
the
expansion
mechanism
of
the
universe
.
in
the
late
1920s
,
hubble
observed
that
the
line
spectra
of
distant
galaxies
are
red
shifted
.
this
is
because
of
the
doppler
effect
association
with
the
recession
velocity
v.
the
wavelength
lambda
prime
observed
on
earth
is
offset
with
respect
to
lambda
,
the
wavelength
in
the
rest
frame
of
the
emitter
.
the
red
shift
parameter
is
called
z
,
equal
to
Ã¢ÂÂlambda/lambda
.
using
the
redshift
to
measure
the
velocity
v
,
and
the
magnitude
as
an
estimator
of
the
distance
r
to
the
emitter
,
one
empirically
observes
hubbleÃ¢ÂÂs
law
,
v
=
hr
.
recessional
velocities
are
,
thus
,
proportional
to
distance
with
a
coefficient
called
the
hubble
constant
h.
hubble
's
law
corresponds
to
a
uniform
expansion
of
all
distances
including
all
wavelength
by
a
factor
r
(
t
)
where
r_0
is
the
current
scale
at
t
=
t_0
which
is
today
.
without
loss
of
generality
,
we
can
normalize
any
distance
to
r_0
=
1.
r
then
becomes
a
generic
distance
scale
.
the
hubble
constant
is
given
by
the
relative
rate
of
change
in
r
,
r_dot/r
.
contrary
to
its
name
,
h
is
not
constant
because
of
the
decelerating
effect
of
gravity
on
the
expansion
of
the
universe
and
the
accelerated
effect
of
dark
energy
.
today
,
we
find
h_0
roughly
equal
to
70
kilometers
per
second
per
mega
parsec
,
with
an
accuracy
of
a
few
percent
,
although
the
various
methods
for
determining
this
constant
,
give
somewhat
different
results
,
as
shown
in
the
plot
on
the
right
.
one
expresses
large
,
astronomical
distances
in
parsec
.
one
parsec
roughly
equals
31
10^12
kilometers
,
and
is
defined
as
the
distance
at
which
the
mean
radius
of
the
earth
orbit
around
the
sun
subtends
an
angle
of
one
arc
second
.
the
evolution
of
the
universe
is
dominated
by
the
action
of
gravity
since
early
in
its
history
.
it
follows
the
solution
of
equations
describing
general
relativity
.
for
a
homogeneous
and
the
isotropic
distribution
of
matter
at
large
scales
,
it
is
described
by
the
friedmann
equation
.
the
first
term
containing
newton
's
constant
g_n
and
the
mass
or
energy
density
rho
of
matter
describes
the
decelerating
action
of
gravity
.
the
constants
k
and
lambda
determine
the
asymptotic
evolution
.
the
cosmological
constant
lambda
potentially
corresponds
to
an
energy
associated
with
a
vacuum
,
the
so-called
dark
energy
.
for
now
,
we
neglect
this
term
,
although
it
may
dominate
the
evolution
of
the
universe
today
.
if
you
're
interested
in
the
motivation
behind
such
an
equation
,
we
recommend
the
small
calculation
in
video
8.3a
.
the
constant
k
corresponds
to
an
intrinsic
curvature
of
space
generated
by
its
total
energy
.
there
are
three
distinct
cases
.
for
k
=
-1
,
this
corresponds
to
a
total
positive
energy
.
this
case
describes
a
so-called
open
universe
that
extends
to
infinity
with
r-dot
tending
towards
one
for
large
t.
in
this
case
,
the
curvature
term
-k/r^2
is
positive
.
for
k
=
+1
,
corresponds
to
a
negative
total
energy
,
a
closed
universe
with
negative
curvature
which
extends
to
a
maximum
radius
and
then
shrinks
.
the
special
case
,
k=0
is
that
of
a
s0-called
flat
universe
,
where
the
kinetic
and
potential
energy
are
equal
,
the
total
energy
and
thus
the
curvature
are
zero
.
the
rate
of
expansion
tends
towards
r-dot
=
0
on
the
long
term
.
an
inventory
of
the
contents
of
the
universe
today
shows
a
remarkable
density
similar
to
the
density
corresponding
to
k
=
0.
so
we
neglect
this
term
.
integrating
the
friedmann
equation
for
the
special
case
k
=
lambda
=
0
and
in
non
relativistic
approximation
,
a
simplified
expansion
equation
is
obtained
.
from
today
's
value
of
hubble
's
constant
,
we
can
derive
t_0
,
the
age
of
the
universe
,
which
corresponds
to
9.4
gy
.
this
is
well
below
the
edge
of
the
order
subject
we
know
about
which
varies
between
11
and
14
gy
.
obviously
,
a
negative
k
or
a
positive
value
of
the
cosmological
constant
lambda
would
lead
to
an
increased
t_0
prediction
by
the
friedmann
equation
.
since
k
is
roughly
equal
to
0
,
we
need
a
substantial
amount
of
dark
energy
to
obtain
a
reasonable
age
prediction
.
for
k
=
0
and
the
cosmological
constant
lambda
not
equal
to
0
,
the
friedmann
equation
acquires
the
last
term
.
it
corresponds
to
a
constant
energy
density
associated
with
the
vacuum
itself
.
this
corresponding
energy
density
adds
to
the
matter
density
as
shown
in
the
second
equation
.
considering
the
equation
of
state
,
we
see
that
this
energy
exerts
an
internal
pressure
on
the
expansion
of
the
universe
as
shown
by
the
third
equation
.
if
lambda
is
larger
than
zero
,
this
pressure
is
negative
and
accelerates
the
expansion
opposing
the
decelerating
action
of
gravity
.
to
understand
how
we
measure
the
expansion
velocity
in
the
past
,
we
must
remember
that
the
photons
reaching
us
from
a
large
distance
were
issued
in
a
distant
past
.
by
observing
the
red
shift
of
a
characteristic
line
,
we
can
measure
the
velocity
of
the
emitter
in
the
past
.
and
it
can
be
compared
to
that
of
a
closer
source
from
photons
emitted
more
recently
.
for
this
,
we
need
an
estimate
of
the
distance
z
,
which
is
independent
of
the
red
shift
.
the
observed
flux
f
,
of
photons
,
can
be
converted
into
the
luminosity
distance
,
d_l
,
if
the
emitted
luminosity
l
is
known
.
the
luminosity
distance
is
related
to
the
astronomical
magnitude
m
,
by
the
numerical
conversion
given
in
this
formula
.
for
non
relativistic
recessional
velocity
,
we
have
v
roughly
equal
to
z.
for
a
constant
hubble
parameter
,
we
thus
expect
a
relationship
m
(
z
)
=
a
+
b
log10
(
z
)
,
between
the
magnitude
m
and
the
red
shift
z.
provided
one
can
identify
a
standard
kind
of
source
with
constant
emitted
luminosity
l
,
one
can
then
find
a
sample
of
m_i
at
sufficiently
different
z_i
and
test
this
proportionality
.
thermonuclear
explosions
of
type
1a
supernova
are
such
a
standard
candle
.
their
brightness
can
be
derived
from
the
properties
of
the
light
curve
,
i.e
.
the
photon
flux
over
time
.
measurement
results
are
shown
here
,
with
the
log
of
the
red
shift
,
ie
,
the
recessional
velocity
as
the
ordinate
,
and
the
magnitude
as
the
abscissa
.
turns
out
,
that
for
large
distances
,
the
recession
of
velocity
is
always
less
than
what
is
expected
for
a
lambda
equal
to
zero
.
the
expansion
of
the
universe
is
accelerating
.
it
is
now
faster
than
it
was
in
the
past
.
for
this
discovery
,
perlmutter
,
schmidt
and
riess
have
received
the
2011
physics
nobel
prize
.
but
a
word
of
caution
is
required
here
.
the
methodology
providing
evidence
for
dark
energy
is
continuously
under
scrutiny
.
in
a
recent
paper
,
subir
sarkar
and
his
collaborators
have
analyzed
a
larger
sample
of
sources
.
this
plot
shows
the
difference
of
the
measurements
from
the
the
straight
line
in
the
magnitude
red
shift
relation
that
we
've
shown
in
the
previous
slide
.
it
is
clear
that
the
spread
of
the
data
is
comparable
if
not
greater
than
the
expected
effect
of
dark
energy
indicated
by
the
blue
line
.
no
dark
energy
corresponds
to
the
dashed
red
line
.
th
authors
conclude
that
a
universe
without
dark
energy
is
improbable
of
the
order
of
0.3
%
but
it
is
not
impossible
.
the
universe
today
therefore
probably
consists
of
26.8
%
dark
matter
,
68.3
%
dark
energy
totalling
95.1
%
.
this
leaves
place
for
no
more
than
4.9
%
of
ordinary
matter
.
the
density
of
dark
energy
is
very
low
.
it
's
of
the
order
of
6
10^-27
kilograms
per
cubic
meter
,
such
that
the
total
solar
system
up
to
the
orbit
of
pluto
contains
only
a
negligible
amount
compared
to
the
solar
mass
.
but
since
the
distribution
is
uniform
,
dark
energy
dominates
the
evolution
of
the
universe
at
the
cosmological
scale
.
different
forms
of
dark
energy
have
been
proposed
.
and
energy
density
,
filling
space
homogeneously
,
like
a
cosmological
constant
lambda
or
custom
designed
scalar
of
fields
which
generate
this
effect
dynamically
.
for
a
more
in-depth
discussion
of
dark
energy
,
i
refer
to
the
article
by
ruth
durer
cited
at
the
bottom
of
this
page
.
with
this
,
we
have
almost
concluded
our
tour
of
subatomic
physics
.
if
we
compare
to
the
reductionist
program
of
particle
physics
,
that
is
to
understand
the
complete
universe
based
on
its
microscopic
properties
,
we
realize
that
we
have
understood
a
lot
about
a
small
fraction
of
what
's
there
.
the
many
parameters
of
the
standard
model
,
the
masses
or
the
higgs
couplings
,
the
coupling
constants
to
forces
,
mixing
angles
,
etc
ought
to
be
fixed
by
a
more
profound
layer
of
theory
.
unknown
ingredients
,
dark
matter
on
the
side
of
matter
,
dark
energy
and
inflation
on
the
side
of
forces
,
clearly
indicate
that
much
of
the
universe
remains
to
be
discovered
.
and
,
in
addition
,
even
how
to
integrate
gravity
into
our
microscopic
model
of
the
universe
is
far
from
clear
.
this
leaves
enough
work
for
future
generations
of
physicists
,
and
why
not
you
?
in
the
last
video
of
this
module
,
we
interview
professor
ruth
durrer
about
her
vision
of
dark
energy
