to
motivate
the
friedmann
equation
,
we
are
going
to
consider
the
movement
of
mass
m
at
a
cosmological
distance
r
from
us
.
at
cosmological
scales
,
the
universe
is
isotopic
and
homogenous
,
such
that
the
test
mass
will
be
attracted
by
a
mass
m
,
which
is
4Ã¯Â/3
r^3
times
the
average
mass
density
rho
of
the
universe
.
newton
's
law
gives
us
that
m
times
the
acceleration
of
the
test
mass
is
equal
to
minus
newton
's
constant
times
the
test
mass
times
the
mass
m
divided
by
r^2
.
we
can
reorder
this
equation
to
have
all
terms
on
the
left
of
the
equal
sign
.
let
me
integrate
this
second
equation
.
we
get
that
1/2
n
times
the
test
mass
velocity
squared
minus
newton
's
constant
times
the
product
of
the
two
masses
divided
by
r
is
a
constant
of
motion
.
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
kinetic
energy
plus
the
potential
energy
is
a
constant
of
motion
.
you
can
easily
verify
that
this
is
correct
by
taking
the
time
derivative
of
this
result
.
now
,
if
you
set
the
constant
of
integration
equal
to
-1/2
k
and
introduce
our
result
for
m
,
then
we
get
this
equation
.
if
we
now
multiply
both
sides
by
2/r^2
,
we
get
that
(
r-dot/r
)
^2
,
which
is
in
fact
the
hubble
constant
squared
,
is
equal
to
8Ã¯Â
newton
's
constant
divided
by
3
,
minus
k/r^2
.
now
we
can
still
add
to
this
a
cosmological
constant
as
einstein
did
and
obtain
thus
the
complete
friedmann
equation
.
