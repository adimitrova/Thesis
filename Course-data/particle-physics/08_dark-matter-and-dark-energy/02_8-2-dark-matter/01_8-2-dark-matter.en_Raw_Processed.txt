in this eighth module, we discuss 
mysterious components universe, 
dark matter dark energy 
in this second video we 
review dark matter 
following this video you will 
know dark matter is detected 
gravitational effects 
we try to identify quanta, 
particles that make dark matter 
among compelling evidence 
existence dark matter 
is observation rotational 
velocity v stars around galaxy 
a function distance 
r center galaxy 
accordingly to keplers third law, 
this velocity is determined total 
mr, included within orbit 
if mr became nearly constant outside rvis, 
visible boundary galaxy, 
there will a decrease 
in rotational velocity 
square root 
distance 
observation indicates 
contrary that vr remains 
less constant large r 
this means that there is 
an invisible mass halo that extends 
far beyond optical limit 
density decreases 
square distance 
gravitational lensing is a formidable 
tool to measure total mass 
large astronomical structures, 
even this mass emit light 
principle is based 
fact that light rays 
follow straight lines in spacetime 
distorted gravity objects 
in this manner gravity 
object in foreground 
causes multiple deformed images 
object in background 
measuring deformation image 
a galaxy behind cluster example, 
we calculate mass 
cluster in foreground 
in this way a kind tomography 
structure in foreground is obtained 
optical image hubble space 
telescope left shows multiple 
images a galaxy in 
background in blue color 
reconstructed mass 
distribution galaxy 
cluster in foreground 
is shown right 
demonstrates an amorphous 
distribution invisible mass 
peaks luminous 
objects superimposed 
invisible mass dominates visible 
mass cluster, 
galaxies 
another convincing indication is obtained 
observing components so 
called bullet cluster 
consists two 
colliding galaxy clusters 
using gravitational lensing 
xray imaging, we visualize 
behavior different forms 
matter a galaxy cluster collision 
pink part this image is 
reconstructed data 
satellite chandra, 
observing intensity 
xrays emitted cluster 
this corresponds to luminous material 
density shows deformation, 
acceleration friction, 
coalescence is 
expected a collision 
ordinary matter 
blue part contrary, 
is mass densely reconstructed 
gravitational lensing 
distribution shows that 
majority mass 
two clusters passes 
collision without much interaction 
is therefore in advance, 
respect to luminous mass 
we conclude this evidence 
that dark matter accounts 
mass galaxies 
clusters 
this percentage vary a lot 
a recently discovered galaxy, 
dragonfly, 
is even suspected to contain 
dark matter 
is therefore beyond doubt 
that dark matter exists 
contributes to confinement 
matter light in galaxies, 
probably also to formation 
gravitational behavior this 
substance is that 
luminous matter 
so this is indeed a form matter, 
an unconventional one in 
that shines light, 
reflect absorb 
if consists particles, 
properties must following 
must electrically neutral, else 
would radiate light 
evolved 
nonrelativistic velocity 
epoch matterradiation equilibrium 
thats we speak 
cold dark matter 
must interact weakly among 
normal matter 
otherwise products 
reactions will abundant 
finally density must 
compatible missing mass balance 
main research methods 
attempt to identify generic 
dark matter particle 
chi following 
search chi production high energy 
colliders like lhc 
according to profile we showed 
you will find examples 
cern website 
so far researchers identified signals, 
this line is vigorously atlas cms 
anna introduced you to 
research like this in module 
search interaction dark matter ordinary 
matter one looks recoil a heavy nucleus 
low rates tiny recoils, 
this is done cryogenic 
liquid noble gas detector, 
example xenon 
you find information 
website colleagues in zurich 
search 
self annihilation products dark matter 
particles 
antiparticles 
annihilations will give pairs 
ordinary particles antiparticles 
this could result in a detectable 
signal in energy spectra 
otherwise secondary rare cosmic rays like 
positrons antiprotons so 
martin i follow this research line 
alpha magnetic spectrometer 
we search products 
autoannihilation between dark matter 
particles cosmic 
ray spectrometer, ams, 
installed international 
space station several years 
spectrometer identifies cosmic ray 
particles measures energy 
is sensitive to energies between 
a fraction a gev to tev 
has, so far, 
collected billion particles, 
largest sample cosmic rays 
analyzed since discovery 
a hundred years ago 
a result that could relevant 
dark matter detection 
is fact that beyond a few tenths gev 
fluxes cosmic positrons 
electrons deviate normal form 
this is particularly noticeable 
positrons, 
antiparticles rare 
compared to electrons 
this clearly indicates that there is 
a new source electrons positrons, 
characteristic energy 
several hundred gev 
question is whether this is a diffuse 
source annihilation dark 
matter, 
a localized source one 
pulsars close to earth 
two hypotheses 
differentiated detection 
anisotropies in arrival 
direction electrons positrons 
a higher level anisotropy is 
expected localized nearby sources 
we will probably able to 
distinguish two candidate 
mechanisms future data 
ams experiment 
also, rate spectrum 
falls back to normal shape, 
maximum, is full information 
if extra source is 
annihilation dark matter 
that mass imposes a well defined upper 
limit annihilation product 
here, we show an example 
a dark matter particle mass 
gev in red 
if there astrophysical sources, 
disappearance signal will much 
slower, indicated blue line 
we thus actively fencing in dark matter 
sides experimental searches 
i hope to still see dark matter 
particle identified lifetime 
i much less optimistic 
regarding dark energy, 
is discussed in next video
