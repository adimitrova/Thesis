2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:16,491
In this eighth module, we discuss
the mysterious components of the universe,

3
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,050
which are dark matter and dark energy.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,890
In this second video we
review the dark matter.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,464
After following this video you will
know how dark matter is detected by its

6
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,104
gravitational effects.

7
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:36,860
And how we try to identify its quanta,
the particles that make up dark matter.

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,536
Among the most compelling evidence for
the existence of dark matter

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:48,870
is the observation of the rotational
velocity v of stars around their galaxy

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,310
as a function of their distance
R from the center of the galaxy.

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,320
Accordingly to Kepler's third law,

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,735
this velocity is determined by the total
M(R), included within the orbit.

13
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:11,033
If M(R) became nearly constant outside R_vis,
the visible boundary of the galaxy,

14
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:15,131
there will be a decrease
in the rotational velocity

15
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,688
with the square root of
distance from then on.

16
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,737
Observation indicates on
the contrary that v(R) remains more or

17
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:26,530
less constant at large R.

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,160
This means that there is
an invisible mass halo that extends

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,815
far beyond the optical limit.

20
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,870
Its density decreases with
the square of the distance.

21
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,490
Gravitational lensing is a formidable

22
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,090
tool to measure the total mass of
large astronomical structures,

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,210
even when this mass does not emit light.

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,290
The principle is based on
the fact that light rays

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,096
follow straight lines in space-time
distorted by the gravity of objects.

26
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:01,280
In this manner the gravity of
the object in the foreground

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,340
causes multiple deformed images
of the object in the background.

28
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,170
Measuring the deformation of the image of
a galaxy behind the cluster for example,

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,390
we can calculate the mass of
the cluster in the foreground.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,340
In this way a kind of tomography of the
structure in the foreground is obtained.

31
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,419
The optical image from the Hubble Space
telescope on the left shows multiple

32
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,818
images of a galaxy in
the background in blue color.

33
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,720
The reconstructed mass
distribution of the galaxy

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,390
cluster in the foreground
is shown on the right.

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,880
It demonstrates an amorphous
distribution of invisible mass

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,150
on which peaks of luminous
objects are superimposed.

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,060
The invisible mass dominates the visible
mass of the cluster, as it does for

38
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,030
galaxies.

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,020
Another convincing indication is obtained
by observing the components of the so

40
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,380
called bullet cluster.

41
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,110
It consists of two
colliding galaxy clusters.

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,280
Using gravitational lensing and
x-ray imaging, we can visualize

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,440
the behavior of different forms of
matter after a galaxy cluster collision.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,455
The pink part of this image is
are reconstructed from data of

45
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,545
the satellite Chandra,

46
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:31,135
observing the intensity of
X-rays emitted by the cluster.

47
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:35,773
This corresponds to the luminous material
density which shows the deformation,

48
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:37,598
the acceleration by friction,

49
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,496
and the coalescence which is
expected after such a collision for

50
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,450
ordinary matter.

51
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,460
The blue part on the contrary,

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,910
is the mass densely reconstructed
through gravitational lensing.

53
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,800
The distribution shows that
the majority of the mass of

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,900
the two clusters passes through the
collision without too much interaction.

55
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,550
It is therefore in advance,
with respect to the luminous mass.

56
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,010
We conclude from all this evidence
that dark matter accounts for

57
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,490
about 85% of the mass of galaxies and
their clusters.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,060
But this percentage can vary a lot.

59
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,366
A recently discovered galaxy,
Dragonfly-44,

60
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:25,444
is even suspected to contain
99.9% of dark matter.

61
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:29,208
It is therefore beyond doubt
that dark matter exists

62
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:34,190
and contributes to the confinement
of matter and light in galaxies, and

63
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,675
probably also to their formation.

64
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:41,435
The gravitational behavior of this
substance is the same as that of

65
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,360
luminous matter.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,110
So this is indeed a form of matter, but

67
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,690
an unconventional one in
that it shines no light,

68
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,690
does not reflect nor absorb it.

69
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,870
If it consists of particles,
their properties must be the following.

70
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,543
They must be electrically neutral, else
they would radiate light.

71
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:07,020
They should have evolved
at non-relativistic velocity at

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,610
the epoch of matter-radiation equilibrium.

73
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,555
That's why we speak of
cold dark matter.

74
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:17,290
And they must interact weakly among
themselves and with normal matter.

75
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,800
Otherwise the products of
their reactions will be abundant.

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,180
And finally their density must be
compatible with the missing mass balance.

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,803
The main research methods which
attempt to identify the generic

78
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:37,345
dark matter particle
chi are the following.

79
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,939
Search for chi production at the high energy
colliders like the LHC

80
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,830
according to the profile we just showed.

81
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,017
You will find examples of
these on the CERN website.

82
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:56,550
So far researchers have not identified signals, but 
this line is vigorously by ATLAS and CMS.

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,970
And Anna has introduced you to
research like this in module 7.

84
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,782
Search for interaction of dark matter with ordinary 
matter where one looks for recoil of a heavy nucleus.

85
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,509
Because of the low rates and tiny recoils,

86
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,079
this is done with cryogenic
liquid noble gas detector,

87
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,630
for example with xenon.

88
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,700
You can find more information on
the website of our colleagues in Zurich.

89
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,891
The search for
self annihilation products of dark matter

90
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:32,900
particles which are their own
anti-particles.

91
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,381
Annihilations will give pairs of
ordinary particles and anti-particles.

92
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:42,677
This could result in a detectable
signal in the energy spectra of

93
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:50,180
otherwise secondary and rare cosmic rays like 
positrons and antiprotons and so on.

94
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,530
Martin and I follow this research line
with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.

95
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,989
We search for products of
auto-annihilation between dark matter

96
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:04,890
particles with our cosmic
ray spectrometer, AMS,

97
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,700
installed on the International
Space Station for several years.

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,730
The spectrometer identifies cosmic ray
particles and measures their energy.

99
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:21,396
It is sensitive to energies between
a fraction of a GeV up to TeV.

100
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:25,250
It has, so far,
collected over 85 billion particles,

101
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,644
the largest sample of cosmic rays
analyzed since their discovery more

102
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:31,290
than a hundred years ago.

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,237
A result that could be relevant for
dark matter detection

104
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:42,157
is the fact that beyond a few tenths of GeV
the fluxes of cosmic positrons and

105
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:46,280
electrons deviate from their normal form.

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,560
This is particularly noticeable for
positrons,

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,960
antiparticles which are rare
compared to electrons.

108
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,141
This clearly indicates that there is
a new source of electrons and positrons,

109
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:03,460
with the characteristic energy of
several hundred GeV.

110
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,829
The question is whether this is a diffuse
source such as the annihilation of dark

111
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:08,367
matter,

112
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:14,600
or a localized source such as one or
more pulsars close to Earth.

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,337
These two hypotheses can be
differentiated by the detection

114
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:23,520
of anisotropies in the arrival
direction of electrons and positrons.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,060
A higher level of anisotropy is
expected from localized nearby sources.

116
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,330
We will probably be able to
distinguish the two candidate

117
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,500
mechanisms with future data
from the AMS experiment.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,240
Also, the rate at which the spectrum
falls back to its normal shape,

119
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,030
after the maximum, is full of information.

120
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,090
If the extra source is
annihilation of dark matter

121
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,910
that mass imposes a well defined upper
limit on any annihilation product.

122
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,230
Here, we show an example of
a dark matter particle mass of

123
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,400
700 GeV in red.

124
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,650
If there are astrophysical sources,

125
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:09,370
the disappearance of the signal will be much
slower, as indicated by the blue line.

126
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,110
We are thus actively fencing in dark matter
from all sides with experimental searches.

127
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,831
And I hope to still see the dark matter
particle identified during my lifetime.

128
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:25,179
I am much less optimistic
regarding dark energy,

129
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,500
which is discussed in the next video.
