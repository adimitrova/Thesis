hello, welcome to this eighth, 
last module introductory 
course to subatomic physics 
in this eighth module, we will talk 
two mysterious components 
universe dark matter 
dark energy 
following this video you will 
we know big bang 
major steps in history 
universe beginning to today 
observations indicate that universe 
created tens billions years 
ago in is called a big bang 
went an extremely 
hot period afterwards 
cooled expansion, 
to current 
temperature kelvin 
here, you see a schematic 
representation evolution 
features cosmological standard 
model we know today primarily 
based following observations 
first all, systematic red shift 
spectral lines distant galaxies 
leads to hubbles law 
second, cosmic microwave background 
corresponds to that a black body 
abundance light elements in cosmic 
rays distribution largescale 
structures, galaxies, 
clusters galaxies, etc, 
relation to anisotropies 
microwave radiation 
we will walk you major steps 
history universe, 
review 
phenomena we go along 
extrapolation current 
universe backwards in time 
leads us to an infinite energydensity 
concentrated in a single point 
beginning there thus 
a singularity, big bang 
you afraid singularities 
show everywhere 
we talk volume density 
volume tends to zero 
total energy universe was, 
course, finite 
today we know 
volume extremely small 
constantly 
expanding ever since 
careful to trust intuition 
you think expansion 
universe 
idea that this is happening relative 
to a fixed system reference, 
is completely wrong 
if you think like explosion 
a firecracker in night sky, 
youre mistaken 
is space expands 
theres way to observe this 
process outside 
expansion concerns 
distance between two objects, 
length, 
wavelength photons, example 
this expansion, temperature 
universe decreased 
mechanism that fridge 
is using to cool vegetables 
we speculate 
first few 
in life universe 
in this era, temperature so 
high that forces 
strength including gravitation 
in addition, dimensions that 
gravity to work in a quantized way, 
we know nothing 
homogeneity temperature 
in universe indicates that 
diametrically opposite regions in 
causal contact shortly this era 
this is explicable unless 
is assumed that around 
seconds 
big bang, expansion 
universe passed an exponential 
superluminous phase 
is called a period inflation 
driving mechanism 
remains to discovered 
again, we must shy away this 
thought, is permissible relativity 
that space expands a velocity 
larger speed light 
indeed, signal exceeds this 
speed limit including this era 
is space is blowing 
end inflation period, 
universe filled a plasma 
quarks gluons 
elementary particles 
temperature that 
particles relativistic 
particles 
antiparticles in thermal equilibrium 
point this era, 
a tiny asymmetry unknown origin 
between matter antimatter appeared 
matter became abundant 
antimatter part in million 
mechanism actually causing this 
unbalance, is called baryogenesis, 
remains to discovered 
cough this mechanism is responsible 
existence 
without it, 
matter would annihilated 
antimatter 
necessary conditions 
this operation formulated 
first time andrei sakharov 
there three conditions 
first one is that c cp symmetry 
must violated to objectively 
distinguish between matter antimatter 
second condition is that 
baryon number must violated so 
that antibaryons disappear 
in favor baryons 
third, this must happen 
outside thermodynamic equilibrium eg 
in a phase transition, example, 
so that antimatter is recreated 
reverse process time 
beyond roughly seconds, 
we know a little 
precisely happened 
in this era, universe is sufficiently 
cooled expansion so that laws 
standard model we 
encountered in this course valid 
energies particles 
comparable to 
accelerators provide 
around seconds, quarks 
gluons combined to form baryons, 
this possible 
kinetic energy ingredients 
prevented bound states 
small excess quarks caused a small 
excess baryons antibaryons 
temperature longer 
sufficient to maintain equilibrium 
between nucleons antinucleons, 
a massive annihilation took place, 
leaving a single proton 
neutron among billion 
a similar process followed one 
second, electrons positrons, 
leaving a tiny fraction electrons 
a few minutes big bang, 
temperature lowered 
to billion kelvin 
neutrons 
protons fused to form deuterium 
helium, 
protons stayed 
point this expansion 
cooling process, energy in form 
gravitational mass began to dominate 
energy photons 
, years, electrons formed 
atoms protons nuclei 
ambient photons 
sufficiently energetic to ionize 
atoms formed 
this time, this longer case, 
photons matter decoupled 
radiation released that 
moment still exists today, 
is called cosmic 
microwave background 
dimensions expand, 
wavelength photons also expands 
corresponding 
temperature decreases 
we call residual radiation 
that event cosmic 
microwave background equivalent 
temperature today is degrees, 
wavelength is thus 
in microwave range 
this radiation, therefore, provides us 
an instantaneous photograph 
state universe in 
, years birth 
is indeed oldest source 
light universe 
opaque since photons 
observed ionizing atoms 
measuring wavelength 
cosmic microwave photons, 
one map temperature 
universe 
this done first using ground 
based microwave antennas 
then, specialized 
satellites like cobe, wmap 
recently planck satellite 
distribution photon 
energy given direction 
exactly follows one expected 
an ideal black body 
characteristic temperatures 
found to homogeneous 
level th a permil even 
diametrically opposite directions 
this is motivation 
postulating so called inflationary era 
however, there indeed small 
fluctuations around average 
temperature, caused 
regions slight underdensity 
probably seeds 
around large 
structures matter that we 
observe today formed 
since then, thus, long 
period lasts until today, 
gravitational attraction caused 
matter to form gas clouds, stars, 
galaxies galaxy clusters so 
details structure formation 
depend type quantity matter 
available dark matter may helped 
in this process well see in video 
stars formed, 
elements heavy helium 
cooked nuclear fusion 
we learned in module 
if one takes stock observed 
components universe, 
one finds following 
total density matter 
deduced 
gravitational potential measured 
movement stars 
galaxies is order 
kilograms per cubic meter 
total density baryons, visible 
invisible, measured deduced 
well established baryogenesis process 
is smaller a factor ten 
visible matter, shining light, 
concentrated in stars, gas 
dust is less dense 
a factor five 
matter is thus 
neither visible baryonic 
is called dark matter 
we will talk in next video 
rest energy 
density universe is 
provided an even mysterious form 
is called dark energy 
appears to currently accelerating 
expansion universe 
we speak little that 
is known in video 
first, we will discuss 
dark matter in next video
