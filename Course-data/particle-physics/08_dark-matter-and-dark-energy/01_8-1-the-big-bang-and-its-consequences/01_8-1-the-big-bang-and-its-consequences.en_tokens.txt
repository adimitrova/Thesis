hello
,
and
welcome
to
this
eighth
,
and
last
module
of
our
introductory
course
to
subatomic
physics
.
in
this
eighth
module
,
we
will
talk
about
two
mysterious
components
of
the
universe
which
are
dark
matter
and
dark
energy
.
after
following
this
video
you
will
now
what
we
know
about
the
big
bang
and
what
were
the
major
steps
in
the
history
of
the
universe
from
its
beginning
up
to
today
.
observations
indicate
that
our
universe
was
created
some
tens
of
billions
of
years
ago
in
what
is
called
a
big
bang
and
went
through
an
extremely
hot
period
afterwards
.
it
then
cooled
down
by
expansion
,
down
to
its
current
temperature
of
2.7
kelvin
.
here
,
you
see
a
schematic
representation
of
its
evolution
.
the
features
of
the
cosmological
standard
model
as
we
know
it
today
are
primarily
based
on
the
following
observations
.
first
of
all
,
the
systematic
red
shift
of
spectral
lines
from
distant
galaxies
which
leads
to
hubble
's
law
.
second
,
the
cosmic
microwave
background
which
corresponds
to
that
of
a
black
body
.
the
abundance
of
light
elements
in
cosmic
rays
and
the
distribution
of
large-scale
structures
,
galaxies
,
clusters
of
galaxies
,
etc.
,
and
its
relation
to
the
anisotropies
of
the
microwave
radiation
.
we
will
walk
you
through
some
major
steps
of
the
history
of
the
universe
,
and
review
some
of
these
phenomena
as
we
go
along
.
extrapolation
of
the
current
universe
backwards
in
time
leads
us
to
an
infinite
energy-density
concentrated
in
a
single
point
.
at
the
beginning
there
was
thus
a
singularity
,
the
big
bang
.
you
should
not
be
afraid
of
singularities
.
they
show
up
everywhere
when
we
talk
about
volume
density
when
the
volume
tends
to
zero
.
the
total
energy
of
the
universe
was
,
of
course
,
finite
at
t
=
0
and
the
same
as
today
for
all
we
know
.
but
the
volume
was
extremely
small
.
it
has
been
constantly
expanding
ever
since
.
be
careful
not
to
trust
your
intuition
when
you
think
about
expansion
of
the
universe
.
the
idea
that
this
is
happening
relative
to
a
fixed
system
of
reference
,
is
completely
wrong
.
if
you
think
about
it
like
the
explosion
of
a
firecracker
in
the
night
sky
,
you
're
mistaken
.
it
is
space
itself
which
expands
.
there
's
no
way
to
observe
this
process
from
the
outside
.
and
the
expansion
concerns
not
only
any
distance
between
two
objects
,
but
any
other
length
,
such
as
the
wavelength
of
photons
,
for
example
.
through
this
expansion
,
the
temperature
of
the
universe
has
decreased
by
the
same
mechanism
that
your
fridge
is
using
to
cool
down
your
vegetables
.
we
can
only
speculate
on
the
first
few
10^-40
s
in
the
life
of
the
universe
.
in
this
era
,
the
temperature
was
so
high
that
all
forces
had
the
same
strength
including
gravitation
.
in
addition
,
the
dimensions
were
such
that
gravity
had
to
work
in
a
quantized
way
,
which
we
know
nothing
about
.
the
homogeneity
of
the
temperature
in
the
universe
indicates
that
diametrically
opposite
regions
were
in
causal
contact
shortly
after
this
era
.
this
is
not
explicable
unless
it
is
assumed
that
around
10^-37
seconds
after
the
big
bang
,
the
expansion
of
the
universe
passed
through
an
exponential
and
superluminous
phase
.
it
is
called
a
period
of
inflation
.
its
driving
mechanism
remains
to
be
discovered
.
again
,
we
must
not
shy
away
from
this
thought
,
it
is
permissible
by
relativity
that
space
itself
expands
at
a
velocity
larger
than
the
speed
of
light
.
indeed
,
no
signal
exceeds
this
speed
limit
including
this
era
.
it
is
space
itself
which
is
blowing
up
.
after
the
end
of
the
inflation
period
,
the
universe
was
filled
with
a
plasma
of
quarks
and
gluons
and
other
elementary
particles
.
the
temperature
was
such
that
all
particles
were
relativistic
.
particles
and
antiparticles
were
in
thermal
equilibrium
.
at
some
point
during
this
era
,
a
tiny
asymmetry
of
unknown
origin
between
matter
and
anti-matter
appeared
.
matter
became
more
abundant
than
anti-matter
by
about
1
part
in
30
million
.
the
mechanism
actually
causing
this
unbalance
,
which
is
called
baryogenesis
,
remains
to
be
discovered
.
[
cough
]
this
mechanism
is
responsible
for
our
existence
.
without
it
,
all
matter
would
have
annihilated
with
antimatter
.
the
necessary
conditions
for
this
operation
have
been
formulated
for
the
first
time
by
andrei
sakharov
.
there
are
three
such
conditions
.
the
first
one
is
that
c
and
cp
symmetry
must
be
violated
to
objectively
distinguish
between
matter
and
antimatter
.
the
second
condition
is
that
baryon
number
must
be
violated
so
that
antibaryons
can
disappear
in
favor
of
baryons
.
and
third
,
all
of
this
must
happen
outside
thermodynamic
equilibrium
e.g
.
in
a
phase
transition
,
for
example
,
so
that
anti-matter
is
not
recreated
by
the
reverse
process
all
the
time
.
beyond
roughly
10^-11
seconds
,
we
know
a
little
more
precisely
what
happened
.
in
this
era
,
the
universe
is
sufficiently
cooled
down
by
expansion
so
that
the
laws
of
the
standard
model
which
we
have
encountered
in
this
course
are
valid
.
the
energies
of
the
particles
were
then
comparable
to
what
accelerators
can
provide
.
around
10^-6
seconds
,
quarks
and
gluons
combined
to
form
baryons
,
before
this
was
not
possible
because
the
kinetic
energy
of
the
ingredients
prevented
bound
states
.
the
small
excess
of
quarks
caused
a
small
excess
of
baryons
over
antibaryons
.
when
the
temperature
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
between
nucleons
and
anti-nucleons
,
a
massive
annihilation
took
place
,
leaving
only
about
a
single
proton
or
neutron
among
100
billion
.
a
similar
process
followed
at
about
one
second
,
for
electrons
and
positrons
,
leaving
a
tiny
fraction
of
electrons
.
a
few
minutes
after
the
big
bang
,
the
temperature
had
lowered
to
some
billion
kelvin
.
neutrons
and
protons
fused
to
form
deuterium
and
helium
,
but
most
protons
stayed
on
their
own
.
at
some
point
during
this
expansion
cooling
process
,
energy
in
the
form
of
gravitational
mass
began
to
dominate
over
the
energy
of
photons
.
after
some
380,000
years
,
electrons
formed
atoms
with
protons
and
other
nuclei
.
before
the
ambient
photons
were
sufficiently
energetic
to
ionize
atoms
when
they
formed
.
at
this
time
,
this
was
no
longer
the
case
,
photons
and
matter
decoupled
.
radiation
released
at
that
moment
still
exists
today
,
it
is
called
the
cosmic
microwave
background
.
when
all
dimensions
expand
,
the
wavelength
of
photons
also
expands
.
and
the
corresponding
temperature
decreases
.
we
call
the
residual
radiation
from
that
event
the
cosmic
microwave
background
because
its
equivalent
temperature
today
is
2.7
degrees
,
the
wavelength
is
thus
in
the
microwave
range
.
this
radiation
,
therefore
,
provides
us
with
an
instantaneous
photograph
of
the
state
the
universe
was
in
380,000
years
after
its
birth
.
it
is
indeed
the
oldest
source
of
light
because
before
the
universe
was
opaque
since
photons
were
observed
when
ionizing
atoms
.
by
measuring
the
wavelength
of
the
cosmic
microwave
photons
,
one
can
map
the
temperature
of
the
universe
.
this
was
done
first
using
ground
based
microwave
antennas
.
and
then
,
with
specialized
satellites
like
cobe
,
wmap
and
most
recently
with
the
planck
satellite
.
the
distribution
of
photon
energy
from
any
given
direction
exactly
follows
the
one
expected
for
an
ideal
black
body
.
the
characteristic
temperatures
are
found
to
be
homogeneous
at
the
level
of
100th
of
a
per-mil
even
for
diametrically
opposite
directions
.
this
is
the
motivation
for
postulating
the
so
called
inflationary
era
.
however
,
there
are
indeed
small
fluctuations
around
the
average
temperature
,
which
were
caused
by
regions
of
slight
over-
or
under-density
.
these
are
probably
the
seeds
around
which
the
large
structures
of
matter
that
we
observe
today
have
formed
.
since
then
,
thus
,
over
the
long
period
which
lasts
until
today
,
gravitational
attraction
has
caused
matter
to
form
gas
clouds
,
then
stars
,
galaxies
and
galaxy
clusters
and
so
on
.
the
details
of
the
structure
formation
depend
on
the
type
of
quantity
of
matter
available-
dark
matter
may
have
helped
in
this
process
as
we
'll
see
in
video
8.2.
once
stars
are
formed
,
elements
heavy
than
helium
are
cooked
by
nuclear
fusion
as
we
learned
in
module
2.
if
one
takes
stock
of
the
observed
components
of
the
universe
,
one
finds
the
following
.
the
total
density
of
matter
deduced
from
the
gravitational
potential
measured
from
the
movement
of
stars
and
galaxies
is
of
the
order
of
10^-27
kilograms
per
cubic
meter
.
the
total
density
of
baryons
,
visible
or
invisible
,
both
measured
and
deduced
from
the
well
established
baryogenesis
process
is
smaller
by
about
a
factor
of
ten
.
visible
matter
,
shining
light
,
concentrated
in
stars
,
gas
and
dust
is
again
less
dense
by
a
factor
of
five
.
most
of
the
matter
is
thus
neither
visible
nor
baryonic
.
it
is
called
dark
matter
.
we
will
talk
about
it
in
the
next
video
.
the
rest
of
the
energy
density
of
the
universe
is
provided
by
an
even
more
mysterious
form
.
it
is
called
dark
energy
and
appears
to
be
currently
accelerating
the
expansion
of
the
universe
.
we
speak
about
the
little
that
is
known
about
it
in
video
8.3.
but
first
,
we
will
discuss
dark
matter
in
the
next
video
.
