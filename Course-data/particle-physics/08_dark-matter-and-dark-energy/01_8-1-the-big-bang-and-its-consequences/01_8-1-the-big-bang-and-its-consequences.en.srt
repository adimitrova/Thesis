2
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,401
Hello, and welcome to this eighth, and

3
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:15,820
last module of our introductory
course to subatomic physics.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,320
In this eighth module, we will talk
about two mysterious components

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,749
of the Universe which are dark matter and
dark energy.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,320
After following this video you will now
what we know about the Big Bang and what

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,100
were the major steps in the history of the
Universe from its beginning up to today.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,410
Observations indicate that our Universe
was created some tens of billions of years

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,130
ago in what is called a Big Bang and

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,260
went through an extremely
hot period afterwards.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,800
It then cooled down by expansion,

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,491
down to its current
temperature of 2.7 Kelvin.

13
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:52,420
Here, you see a schematic
representation of its evolution.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,230
The features of the cosmological standard
model as we know it today are primarily

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,570
based on the following observations.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,700
First of all, the systematic red shift
of spectral lines from distant galaxies

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,840
which leads to Hubble's law.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,710
Second, the cosmic microwave background
which corresponds to that of a black body.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,230
The abundance of light elements in cosmic
rays and the distribution of large-scale

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,700
structures, galaxies,
clusters of galaxies, etc., and

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,870
its relation to the anisotropies
of the microwave radiation.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,050
We will walk you through some major steps
of the history of the Universe, and

23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,500
review some of these
phenomena as we go along.

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,310
Extrapolation of the current
Universe backwards in time

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,920
leads us to an infinite energy-density
concentrated in a single point.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,740
At the beginning there was thus
a singularity, the Big Bang.

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,470
You should not be afraid of singularities.

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,000
They show up everywhere when
we talk about volume density

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,070
when the volume tends to zero.

30
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,280
The total energy of the Universe was,
of course, finite at t = 0 and

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,970
the same as today for all we know.

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,140
But the volume was extremely small.

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,170
It has been constantly
expanding ever since.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,730
Be careful not to trust your intuition
when you think about expansion

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,310
of the Universe.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,470
The idea that this is happening relative
to a fixed system of reference,

37
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,000
is completely wrong.
If you think about it like the explosion

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
of a firecracker in the night sky,
you're mistaken.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,860
It is space itself which expands.

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,340
There's no way to observe this
process from the outside.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,280
And the expansion concerns not only
any distance between two objects, but

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,590
any other length, such as
the wavelength of photons, for example.

43
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,660
Through this expansion, the temperature
of the Universe has decreased

44
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,670
by the same mechanism that your fridge
is using to cool down your vegetables.

45
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,380
We can only speculate on
the first few 10^-40 s

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,150
in the life of the Universe.

47
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,220
In this era, the temperature was so

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,170
high that all forces had the same
strength including gravitation.

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,460
In addition, the dimensions were such that
gravity had to work in a quantized way,

50
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,509
which we know nothing about.

51
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,300
The homogeneity of the temperature
in the Universe indicates that

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,600
diametrically opposite regions were in
causal contact shortly after this era.

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,920
This is not explicable unless
it is assumed that around 

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,490
10^-37 seconds

55
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,170
after the Big Bang, the expansion of the
Universe passed through an exponential and

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,730
superluminous phase.

57
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,870
It is called a period of inflation.

58
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,020
Its driving mechanism
remains to be discovered.

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,455
Again, we must not shy away from this
thought, it is permissible by relativity

60
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:43,755
that space itself expands at a velocity
larger than the speed of light.

61
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:49,555
Indeed, no signal exceeds this
speed limit including this era.

62
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,545
It is space itself which is blowing up.

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,191
After the end of the inflation period,
the Universe was filled with a plasma of 

64
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,570
quarks and gluons and
other elementary particles.

65
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,360
The temperature was such that
all particles were relativistic.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,080
Particles and
antiparticles were in thermal equilibrium.

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,930
At some point during this era,

68
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,380
a tiny asymmetry of unknown origin
between matter and anti-matter appeared.

69
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,510
Matter became more abundant than
anti-matter by about 1 part in 30 million.

70
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,182
The mechanism actually causing this
unbalance, which is called baryogenesis,

71
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,699
remains to be discovered.

72
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,900
[COUGH] This mechanism is responsible for
our existence.

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,333
Without it,
all matter would have annihilated

74
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,949
with antimatter.

75
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,691
The necessary conditions for
this operation have been formulated for

76
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,948
the first time by Andrei Sakharov.

77
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:45,652
There are three such conditions.

78
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:50,360
The first one is that C and CP symmetry
must be violated to objectively

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,090
distinguish between matter and antimatter.

80
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,530
The second condition is that
baryon number must be violated so

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,920
that antibaryons can disappear
in favor of baryons.

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,284
And third, all of this must happen
outside thermodynamic equilibrium e.g.

83
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,883
in a phase transition, for example,

84
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:13,856
so that anti-matter is not recreated
by the reverse process all the time.

85
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,138
Beyond roughly 10^-11 seconds,

86
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,359
we know a little more
precisely what happened.

87
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,680
In this era, the Universe is sufficiently
cooled down by expansion so that the laws

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,870
of the standard model which we have
encountered in this course are valid.

89
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,090
The energies of the particles
were then comparable to what

90
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,270
accelerators can provide.

91
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,010
Around 10^-6 seconds, quarks and

92
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,270
gluons combined to form baryons,
before this was not possible because the

93
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,095
kinetic energy of the ingredients
prevented bound states.

94
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:51,580
The small excess of quarks caused a small
excess of baryons over antibaryons.

95
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,070
When the temperature was no longer
sufficient to maintain the equilibrium 

96
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,890
between nucleons and anti-nucleons,
a massive annihilation took place,

97
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,690
leaving only about a single proton or
neutron among 100 billion.

98
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,820
A similar process followed at about one
second, for electrons and positrons,

99
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,280
leaving a tiny fraction of electrons.

100
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,140
A few minutes after the Big Bang,

101
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,690
the temperature had lowered
to some billion Kelvin.

102
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,440
Neutrons and
protons fused to form deuterium and

103
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
helium, but
most protons stayed on their own.

104
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,288
At some point during this expansion
cooling process, energy in the form of

105
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,942
gravitational mass began to dominate
over the energy of photons.

106
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:37,945
After some 380,000 years, electrons formed
atoms with protons and other nuclei.

107
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:41,625
Before the ambient photons were
sufficiently energetic to ionize

108
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,255
atoms when they formed.

109
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:50,785
At this time, this was no longer the case,
photons and matter decoupled.

110
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,175
Radiation released at that
moment still exists today,

111
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,389
it is called the cosmic
microwave background.

112
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,070
When all dimensions expand,
the wavelength of photons also expands.

113
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,520
And the corresponding
temperature decreases.

114
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,070
We call the residual radiation
from that event the cosmic

115
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,400
microwave background because its equivalent
temperature today is 2.7 degrees,

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,790
the wavelength is thus
in the microwave range.

117
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,630
This radiation, therefore, provides us
with an instantaneous photograph of

118
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,660
the state the Universe was in
380,000 years after its birth.

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,900
It is indeed the oldest source of
light because before the Universe was

120
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,580
opaque since photons were
observed when ionizing atoms.

121
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,400
By measuring the wavelength of
the cosmic microwave photons,

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
one can map the temperature
of the Universe.

123
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,470
This was done first using ground
based microwave antennas.

124
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,720
And then, with specialized
satellites like COBE, WMAP and

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,279
most recently with the Planck satellite.

126
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,980
The distribution of photon
energy from any given direction

127
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,170
exactly follows the one expected for
an ideal black body.

128
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,070
The characteristic temperatures
are found to be homogeneous

129
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,950
at the level of 100th of a per-mil even for
diametrically opposite directions.

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,030
This is the motivation for
postulating the so called inflationary era.

131
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,930
However, there are indeed small
fluctuations around the average

132
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,130
temperature, which were caused by
regions of slight over- or under-density.

133
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,610
These are probably the seeds
around which the large

134
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,990
structures of matter that we
observe today have formed.

135
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,380
Since then, thus, over the long
period which lasts until today,

136
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,160
gravitational attraction has caused
matter to form gas clouds, then stars,

137
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,530
galaxies and galaxy clusters and so on.

138
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,290
The details of the structure formation
depend on the type of quantity of matter

139
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,620
available- Dark matter may have helped
in this process as we'll see in video 8.2.

140
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,301
Once stars are formed,
elements heavy than helium

141
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:56,679
are cooked by nuclear fusion
as we learned in module 2.

142
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:03,369
If one takes stock of the observed
components of the Universe,

143
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,540
one finds the following.

144
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,414
The total density of matter
deduced from 

145
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,962
the gravitational potential measured
from the movement of stars and

146
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:15,710
galaxies is of the order of
10^-27 kilograms per cubic meter.

147
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,100
The total density of baryons, visible or
invisible, both measured and deduced from

148
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,050
the well established baryogenesis process
is smaller by about a factor of ten.

149
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,230
Visible matter, shining light,
concentrated in stars, gas and

150
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,280
dust is again less dense
by a factor of five.

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,730
Most of the matter is thus
neither visible nor baryonic.

152
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,170
It is called dark matter.

153
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,840
We will talk about it in the next video.

154
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,150
The rest of the energy
density of the Universe is

155
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,600
provided by an even more mysterious form.

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,670
It is called dark energy and

157
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,840
appears to be currently accelerating
the expansion of the Universe.

158
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,789
We speak about the little that
is known about it in video 8.3.

159
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:02,076
But first, we will discuss
dark matter in the next video.

160
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:08,129
