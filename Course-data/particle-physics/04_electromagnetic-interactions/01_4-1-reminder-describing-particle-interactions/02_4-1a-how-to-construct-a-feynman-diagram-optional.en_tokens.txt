in
this
video
we
will
give
you
a
few
hints
on
how
to
construct
a
feynman
diagram
for
the
two-body
process
a+b
-
>
c+d
.
we
first
have
to
decide
wether
this
can
be
an
annihilation
process
in
which
the
two
initial
state
particles
annihilate
into
a
gauge
boson
.
in
that
case
the
momentum
transfer
will
be
equal
to
the
total
energy-momentum
.
if
they
can
not
annihilate
,
they
have
to
exchange
a
gauge
boson
in
a
scattering
process
.
in
this
case
the
q^2
is
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
final
particle
momentum
and
the
initial
particle
momentum
.
now
we
must
decide
,
which
gauge
boson
can
be
exchanged
.
first
of
all
we
have
to
remember
that
at
each
vertex
quantum
numbers
are
strictly
conserved
.
first
of
all
baryon
and
lepton
numbers
must
be
conserved
,
and
,
if
we
are
not
talking
about
weak
interactions
,
also
the
particle
flavor
.
then
we
must
consider
the
charge
at
each
vertex
.
if
the
electric
charge
is
not
0
and
it
does
not
change
at
the
vertex
,
we
can
exchange
a
photon
.
if
the
particleÃ¢ÂÂs
weak
isospin
is
not
0
and
the
charge
does
not
change
,
we
can
exchange
a
z.
if
the
charge
does
change
by
Ã¢Â±1
unit
,
we
can
exchange
a
wÃ¢Â±
.
finally
,
if
the
color
is
not
0
and
it
changes
at
the
vertex
,
we
can
exchange
a
gluon
.
so
here
is
a
first
example
,
the
process
e+e-
-
>
u
ubar
.
we
clearly
can
not
couple
the
electron
directly
to
a
u
quark
so
this
is
an
annihilation
process
in
which
the
e+
e-
annihilate
into
a
u
bar
pair
.
this
can
proceed
via
the
exchange
of
a
photon
or
a
z
,
since
both
the
electron
and
the
u
quark
carry
both
electric
and
weak
isospin
charge
.
it
can
not
go
via
the
exchange
of
a
gluon
or
a
w
because
the
e+
e-
does
not
carry
color
and
the
charge
does
not
change
at
the
vertex
.
a
second
example
is
the
process
e+
e-
-
>
nu
unbar
.
unless
the
neutrinos
are
electron-type
neutrinos
,
this
is
again
an
annihilation
process
.
it
proceeds
via
the
exchange
of
a
z
boson
.
it
can
not
proceed
via
photon
exchange
,
because
the
neutrino
does
not
carry
electric
charge
.
neither
the
electron
nor
the
neutrino
are
colored
,
so
gluons
can
not
be
exchanged
.
the
electric
charge
is
not
changing
at
the
vertex
,
so
wÃ¢Â±
exchange
is
also
excluded
.
the
third
example
is
the
process
e-
u
-
>
nu_e
d.
in
this
case
it
must
be
a
scattering
process
,
since
the
e-
can
not
directly
couple
to
the
u
quark
.
they
must
in
fact
exchange
a
w
boson
since
the
charge
changes
by
1
unit
at
each
vertex
.
this
is
possible
because
both
the
e-
and
the
u
quark
carry
weak
isospin
.
they
can
not
exchange
a
photon
since
the
charge
changes
neither
can
they
exchange
a
z.
and
since
the
e-
and
the
nu
do
not
carry
color
,
they
can
not
exchange
a
gluon
either
.
the
next
example
is
the
decay
of
a
d
quark
into
a
u
e-
and
an
electron-antineutrino
.
to
conserve
baryon
and
lepton
number
we
must
connect
the
d
quark
to
the
u
quark
and
the
electron
to
the
antineutrino
.
this
means
that
at
each
vertex
,
the
charge
changes
by
1
unit
and
we
can
exchange
a
w
boson
.
we
can
not
exchange
a
photon
because
the
charge
changes
,
likewise
we
can
not
exchange
a
z.
and
since
the
e-
and
the
nu
donÃ¢ÂÂt
carry
color
we
can
not
exchange
a
gluon
.
the
last
example
is
a
red
d
quark
scattering
off
a
blue
d
quark
,
giving
a
blue
u
quark
and
a
red
d
quark
.
this
is
clearly
a
strong
process
since
it
involves
color
exchange
.
since
strong
interactions
conserve
flavor
,
we
must
connect
the
two
u
quarks
and
also
the
two
d
quarks
.
that
means
that
the
two
vertices
are
connected
by
a
gluon
of
red-antiblue
color
such
that
the
color
is
conserved
at
each
vertex
.
we
can
not
exchange
a
photon
since
the
color
changes
,
neither
a
z
or
a
w
bosons
since
all
of
these
can
not
change
the
color
of
a
particle
.
