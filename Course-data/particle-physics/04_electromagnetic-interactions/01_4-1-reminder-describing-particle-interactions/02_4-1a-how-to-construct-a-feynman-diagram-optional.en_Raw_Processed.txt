in this video we will give you a few hints 
to construct a feynman diagram 
twobody process ab cd 
we first to decide wether this 
an annihilation process in two initial state particles 
annihilate a gauge boson 
in that case momentum transfer will equal 
to total energymomentum 
if cannot annihilate, to 
exchange a gauge boson in a scattering process 
in this case q is equal to difference between 
final particle momentum initial particle momentum 
we must decide, gauge boson exchanged 
first we to remember that vertex 
quantum numbers strictly conserved 
first baryon lepton numbers must conserved, 
and, if we talking weak interactions, 
also particle flavor 
we must consider charge vertex 
if electric charge is change vertex, 
we exchange a photon 
if particles weak isospin is charge change, 
we exchange a z if charge change 
unit, we exchange a w 
finally, if color is changes vertex, 
we exchange a gluon 
so here is a first example, 
process ee u ubar 
we clearly cannot couple electron directly to a u quark 
so this is an annihilation process in 
e e annihilate a u bar pair 
this proceed via exchange a photon 
a z, since electron 
u quark carry electric 
weak isospin charge 
cannot go via exchange a gluon a w 
e e carry color 
charge change 
vertex 
a second example is process e e nu unbar 
unless neutrinos electrontype neutrinos, 
this is an annihilation process 
proceeds via exchange a z boson 
cannot proceed via photon exchange, 
neutrino carry electric charge 
neither electron neutrino colored, 
so gluons cannot exchanged 
electric charge is changing vertex, so 
w exchange is also excluded third 
example is process e u nue d 
in this case must a scattering process, 
since e cannot directly couple to u quark 
must in fact exchange a w boson 
since charge changes unit vertex 
this is possible e u quark 
carry weak isospin 
cannot exchange a photon since charge changes 
neither exchange a z since e nu 
carry color, cannot exchange a gluon either 
next example is decay a d quark a u 
e an electronantineutrino to conserve baryon lepton 
number we must connect d quark to u quark 
electron to antineutrino 
this means that vertex, charge changes unit 
we exchange a w boson we cannot exchange a photon 
charge changes, likewise we cannot exchange a z 
since e nu dont carry color 
we cannot exchange a gluon 
last example is a red d quark scattering a blue d quark, 
giving a blue u quark a red d quark 
this is clearly a strong process since involves color exchange 
since strong interactions conserve flavor, 
we must connect two u quarks also two d quarks 
that means that two 
vertices connected a gluon 
redantiblue color 
that color is conserved vertex 
we cannot exchange a photon since 
color changes, neither a z a w bosons 
since cannot change color a particle
