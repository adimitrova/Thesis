00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,530
In this video we will give you a few hints
on how to construct a Feynman diagram

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,055
for the two-body process a+b -> c+d. 

4
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:22,233
We first have to decide wether this can be 

5
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:26,640
an annihilation process in which the two initial state particles
annihilate into a gauge boson. 

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,220
In that case the momentum transfer will be equal 

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,669
to the total energy-momentum. 

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,350
If they cannot annihilate, they have to 

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,153
exchange a gauge boson in a scattering process. 

10
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:44,720
In this case the q^2 is equal to the difference between 

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,710
the final particle momentum and the initial particle momentum.
Now we must decide, which gauge boson can be exchanged.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,950
First of all we have to remember that at each vertex
quantum numbers are strictly conserved. 

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,040
First of all baryon and lepton numbers must be conserved,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,530
and, if we are not talking about weak interactions, 

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,100
also the particle flavor.  

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,930
Then we must consider the charge at each vertex.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,860
If the electric charge is not 0 and it does not change at the vertex,
we can exchange a photon. 

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,450
If the particle’s weak isospin is not 0 and the charge does not change,

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,099
we can exchange a Z. If the charge does change

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,876
by ±1 unit, we can exchange a W±.

21
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:31,810
Finally, if the color is not 0 and it changes at the vertex,
we can exchange a gluon. 

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,790
So here is a first example,

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,790
the process e+e- -> u ubar. 

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,410
We clearly cannot couple the electron directly to a u quark

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,840
so this is an annihilation process in which the 

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,930
e+ e- annihilate into a u bar pair. 

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,390
This can proceed via the exchange of a photon

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,320
or a Z, since both the electron 

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,030
and the u quark carry both electric 

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,908
and weak isospin charge. 

31
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,064
It cannot go via the exchange of a gluon or a W

32
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:07,783
because the e+ e- does not carry color

33
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,517
and the charge does not change

34
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,665
at the vertex. 

35
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,996
A second example is the process e+ e- -> nu unbar.

36
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:20,940
Unless the neutrinos are electron-type neutrinos, 

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,410
this is again an annihilation process. 

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,890
It proceeds via the exchange of a Z boson. 

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,479
It cannot proceed via photon exchange, because

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,390
the neutrino does not carry electric charge.

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,610
Neither the electron nor the neutrino are colored, 

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,710
so gluons cannot be exchanged. 

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,100
The electric charge is not changing at the vertex, so 

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,000
W± exchange is also excluded. The third

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,070
example is the process e- u -> nu_e d.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,070
In this case it must be a scattering process,
since the e- cannot directly couple to the u quark. 

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,810
They must in fact exchange a W boson 

48
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,370
since the charge changes by 1 unit at each vertex. 

49
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,200
This is possible because both the e- and the u quark

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,210
carry weak isospin. 

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,430
They cannot exchange a photon since the charge changes

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,298
neither can they exchange a Z. And since the e- and the nu do not

53
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,000
carry color, they cannot exchange a gluon either.  

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,630
The next example is the decay of a d quark into a u 

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,520
e- and an electron-antineutrino. To conserve baryon and lepton 

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,890
number we must connect the d quark to the u quark and the 
electron to the antineutrino. 

57
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,000
This means that at each vertex, the charge changes by 1 unit

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,960
and we can exchange a W boson. We cannot exchange a photon

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,890
because the charge changes, likewise we cannot exchange a Z. 

60
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,180
And since the e- and the nu don’t carry color

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,460
we cannot exchange a gluon. 

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,254
The last example is a red d quark scattering off a blue d quark,

63
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:12,040
giving a blue u quark and a red d quark. 
This is clearly a strong process since it involves color exchange. 

64
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,570
Since strong interactions conserve flavor, 

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,410
we must connect the two u quarks and also the two d quarks. 

66
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,400
That means that the two 

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,870
vertices are connected by a gluon 

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,030
of red-antiblue color

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,540
such that the color is conserved at each vertex. 

70
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,050
We cannot exchange a photon since

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,270
the color changes, neither a Z or a W bosons

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:43,691
since all of these cannot change the color of a particle. 

73
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,000
