00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,530
Hello, and welcome to this fourth module

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,055
of our introductory course on subatomic physics.

4
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:22,233
This module starts a series of three
modules, where we talk about the three

5
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:26,640
fundamental forces described by the standard
model of particles physics.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,220
During this first module,
we go into more details

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,669
about the electromagnetic interactions and
their properties.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,350
You will notice that
the intellectual challenge, and

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,153
also the mathematical levels is slightly
higher than in previews modules.

10
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:44,720
But in this first video,
we will remind you how to describe

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,710
the intensity of the reaction using the
cross section and the decay rate, so

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,950
that you are up to speed
with the rest of the course.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,040
After following this video, you will know
the relation between the reaction rate and

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,530
the cross section.

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,100
Also, the relation between the decay rate,
and the lifetime of a particle.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,930
And how the probability amplitude for
a process enters into all these notions.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,860
So, we now resume our discussion
of scattering and decay processes.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,450
To characterize these processes, we need
a quantity which measures the intensity of

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,099
a reaction or, in the context of
quantum mechanics, its probability.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,876
This quantity is the cross section sigma
that we introduced in video 1.3 for

21
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:31,810
scattering processes, and it's analog for
decays, which is called the decay rate.

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,790
Both quantities measure the ratio
of the number of scatters or

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,790
decays, that actually take place, to
the number that would have been possible,

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,410
that could have taken place.

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,840
If this were a game, we would speak
of this probability as the ratio

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,930
between the successes and
the trials of the game.

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,390
We have already seen that the unit for
the cross section is a bit surprising,

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,320
it is a surface.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,030
We will see that for
the decay rate, it is an energy.

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,908
This is due to using the system of natural
units that we have introduced in video

31
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,064
1.2a.

32
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:07,783
If you are still somewhat uneasy with
the construction an interpretation of

33
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,517
Feynman diagrams, like the ones
that you see behind me,

34
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,665
– on the left for a scattering process

35
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,996
on the right for a decay process –

36
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:20,940
you should follow the optional video 4.1a.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,410
As quantum physics takes
a statistical approach,

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,890
the basic problem of particle
physics is the measurement and

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,479
calculation of the probability for
a process.

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,390
Both calculation and
measurement use the cross section

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,610
to express this probability
independently of experimental details.

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,710
We consider here a four-body
reaction a + b -> c + d.

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,100
If each target particle b
has a cross section sigma,

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,000
which represents the probability to hit
it, the rate of scatters per second will be

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,070
proportional to the incident flux of
projectiles and the number of targets.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,070
The cross action is thus defined as
the reaction rate per target particle,

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,810
normalized to the flux of projectiles.

48
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,370
It represents the intensity of a reaction
independent of exponential parameters.

49
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,200
The proportionality factor
between the cross section and

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,210
the rate of interaction
is called luminosity.

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,430
The laboratory frame,
the flux of project ions I_a, 

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,298
that is to say their number per unit surface
and per unit time

53
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,000
is equal to their volume density times

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,630
their velocity relative to the targets b,
which are at rest.

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,520
The luminosity L is the product of this
flux, and the number of targets N_b.

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,890
In a colliding beam experiment on the
country, the luminosity is the product of

57
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,000
the number of projectiles and targets
per bunch, N_a and N_b, multiplied

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,960
by the crossing frequency f and divided by
the surface, that is common to the two beams.

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,890
The unit of the cross section is the barn.

60
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,180
In high energy reactions,

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,460
we rather find cross section of
the order of the nanobarn, or even picobarn.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,254
The smallest known cross sections
are those of neutrinos, of the order of attobarn.

63
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:12,040
As far as decays are concerned,
the description is quite similar.

64
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,570
There's of course

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,410
no projectiles, so we only consider
the particles b in the initial state.

66
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,400
We normalize the number of decays
per second to their current number N_b,

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,870
to find the decay rate Gamma.

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,030
It is the inverse of the lifetime tau_b.

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,540
The decay rate Gamma has
the dimension of an energy.

70
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,050
It is also called
the width of the particle,

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,270
because it corresponds to the uncertainty
in the mass of b particles.

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,010
Therefore, it can be measured either
by measuring the lifetime of the particle,

73
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,691
or by observing the width of the invariant
mass distribution of its decay products.

74
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,920
As the decay rate is a constant,
we find an exponential law for

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,515
the number of remaining
particles at time t.

76
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:54,920
Consequentially, also,

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,710
the absolute number of decay in time
interval ∆t decreases exponentially.

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,320
If several decay channels exist, the lifetime
observed in each channel is of course

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,510
the same, but
the decay rate depends on the channel.

80
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,770
One thus defines a partial decay
rate Gamma_i, for each channel i.

81
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:19,230
By probability conservation the sum
is equal to the total width Gamma.

82
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,950
The branching ratio Gamma_i/Gamma expresses

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,070
the relative probability of observing
channel i, among all decay channels.

84
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,950
Analogous to the differential
cross section,

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,590
one can also measure
the differential decay rate,

86
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,940
dGamma/dOmega,
depending on the solid angle.

87
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,010
Let us think for a moment.

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,470
If, for a decay with multiple decay
channels, we only observe one channel i.

89
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,714
Is the time evolution determined by Gamma,
or is it determined by Gamma_i?

90
00:05:56,233 --> 00:06:00,090
Well, it is, of course,
determined by Gamma.

91
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,914
Since the lifetime of the particle
is independent of the decay channel,

92
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:07,503
that it will choose.

93
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,702
In the next video,
we will apply the concept of

94
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:16,548
cross section to elementary
electromagnetic interactions.
