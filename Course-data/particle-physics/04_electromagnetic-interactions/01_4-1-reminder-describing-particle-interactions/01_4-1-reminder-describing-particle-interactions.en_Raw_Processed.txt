hello, welcome to this fourth module 
introductory course subatomic physics 
this module starts a series three 
modules, we talk three 
fundamental forces described standard 
model particles physics 
this first module, 
we go details 
electromagnetic interactions 
properties 
you will notice that 
intellectual challenge, 
also mathematical levels is slightly 
higher in previews modules 
in this first video, 
we will remind you to describe 
intensity reaction using 
cross section decay rate, so 
that you to speed 
rest course 
following this video, you will know 
relation between reaction rate 
cross section 
also, relation between decay rate, 
lifetime a particle 
probability amplitude 
a process enters notions 
so, we resume discussion 
scattering decay processes 
to characterize processes, we need 
a quantity measures intensity 
a reaction or, in context 
quantum mechanics, probability 
this quantity is cross section sigma 
that we introduced in video 
scattering processes, analog 
decays, is called decay rate 
quantities measure ratio 
number scatters 
decays, that actually take place, to 
number that would possible, 
that could taken place 
if this a game, we would speak 
this probability ratio 
between successes 
trials game 
we already seen that unit 
cross section is a bit surprising, 
is a surface 
we will see that 
decay rate, is an energy 
this is due to using system natural 
units that we introduced in video 
a 
if you still somewhat uneasy 
construction an interpretation 
feynman diagrams, like ones 
that you see behind me, 
left a scattering process 
right a decay process 
you follow optional video a 
quantum physics takes 
a statistical approach, 
basic problem particle 
physics is measurement 
calculation probability 
a process 
calculation 
measurement use cross section 
to express this probability 
independently experimental details 
we consider here a fourbody 
reaction a b c d 
if target particle b 
a cross section sigma, 
represents probability to hit 
it, rate scatters per second will 
proportional to incident flux 
projectiles number targets 
cross action is thus defined 
reaction rate per target particle, 
normalized to flux projectiles 
represents intensity a reaction 
independent exponential parameters 
proportionality factor 
between cross section 
rate interaction 
is called luminosity 
laboratory frame, 
flux project ions ia, 
that is to say number per unit surface 
per unit time 
is equal to volume density times 
velocity relative to targets b, 
rest 
luminosity l is product this 
flux, number targets nb 
in a colliding beam experiment 
country, luminosity is product 
number projectiles targets 
per bunch, na nb, multiplied 
crossing frequency f divided 
surface, that is common to two beams 
unit cross section is barn 
in high energy reactions, 
we rather find cross section 
order nanobarn, even picobarn 
smallest known cross sections 
neutrinos, order attobarn 
far decays concerned, 
description is quite similar 
theres course 
projectiles, so we consider 
particles b in initial state 
we normalize number decays 
per second to current number nb, 
to find decay rate gamma 
is inverse lifetime taub 
decay rate gamma 
dimension an energy 
is also called 
width particle, 
corresponds to uncertainty 
in mass b particles 
therefore, measured either 
measuring lifetime particle, 
observing width invariant 
mass distribution decay products 
decay rate is a constant, 
we find an exponential law 
number remaining 
particles time 
consequentially, also, 
absolute number decay in time 
interval decreases exponentially 
if several decay channels exist, lifetime 
observed in channel is course 
same, 
decay rate depends channel 
one thus defines a partial decay 
rate gammai, channel i 
probability conservation sum 
is equal to total width gamma 
branching ratio gammaigamma expresses 
relative probability observing 
channel i, among decay channels 
analogous to differential 
cross section, 
one also measure 
differential decay rate, 
dgammadomega, 
depending solid angle 
let us think a moment 
if, a decay multiple decay 
channels, we observe one channel i 
is time evolution determined gamma, 
is determined gammai 
well, is, course, 
determined gamma 
since lifetime particle 
is independent decay channel, 
that will choose 
in next video, 
we will apply concept 
cross section to elementary 
electromagnetic interactions
