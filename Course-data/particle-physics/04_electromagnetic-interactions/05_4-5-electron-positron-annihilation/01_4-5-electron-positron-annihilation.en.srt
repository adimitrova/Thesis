2
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,211
In this fourth module, we are in the
process of discussing the properties of

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,039
electromagnetic interactions.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,019
And in this fifth video,
we discuss the annihilation of

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,490
electron-positron pairs
into pairs of fermions.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,731
After following this video, you will know
the main properties of the process of e+ e-

7
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,974
annihilation into lepton pairs, and

8
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:35,141
also the peculiarities of their
annihilation into hadrons.

9
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,524
The annihilation of electron-positron
pairs into pairs of photons that Mercedes

10
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:46,120
has introduced int the previous video
is not the only annihilation reaction.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,321
There's a whole class of reactions
of electron-positron annihilation

12
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:54,180
into fermion-antifermion pairs and
the example is shown here.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,007
We do not include the reaction
e+ e- -> e+ e-,

14
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:03,639
which is complicated by a second
scattering diagram where the two electrons

15
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:06,290
exchange a photon rather than annihilate.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,100
Let us take the creation of
pairs of muons as a prototype.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,617
In the center-of-mass frame the final
state is characterized by two muons

18
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,863
with equal and opposite momentum.

19
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,762
Having no strong interactions and

20
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:21,642
being too heavy to cause
electromagnetic showers,

21
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:26,172
muons penetrate all the material in the
detector, just losing energy by dE/dx.

22
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:33,086
The total cross section again exhibits
the well known factors, alpha squared in

23
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:38,780
the nominator and s, the square of the
characteristic energy, in the denominator.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,394
These are the characteristic factors for

25
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,389
electromagnetic reactions
between point-like particles.

26
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:50,510
The cross section for tau production,
e+ e- -> tau+ tau-, is the same,

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,005
far from threshold, that is to say,
at s, much larger than m_tau^2.

28
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:02,400
The differential cross section is
symmetric with respect to the sign of

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,464
the scattering angle theta,
if one neglects the masses,

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,670
s >> 4 m_µ^2.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,330
The figure shows the angular distribution
at high energy, the dashed lines indicate

32
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,095
the shape of the symmetric distribution
predicted by quantum electrodynamics.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,600
The solid lines include an asymmetric term
that comes from electro-weak interference.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,610
The angular distribution in fact
shows a deviation from symmetry

35
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,940
that increases with energy.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,090
It is due to the interference
with weak interactions

37
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,490
that we will treat in module 6.

38
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:40,690
This prototype cross-section applies to
all annihilation reactions which produce

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,900
a fermion pair of negligible mass and
charge ±e.

40
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,630
The coupling constant is hidden
in the fine structure constant,

41
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,150
alpha = e^2/(4π).

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,944
Again, an identical angular distribution
is observed for the reaction 

43
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:03,368
e+ e -> tau+ tau- at energies much larger
than the threshold for this reaction.

44
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:09,507
Let us now turn to pair production
of quarks, or rather 

45
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:13,480
quark-antiquark pairs by e+ e- annihilation.

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,100
Here we must consider
two important changes.

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,240
First, quarks carry electric charge,
either +2/3 for

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,190
u, c and t quarks or
-1/3 for d, s, and

49
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,800
b quarks,
relative to the elementary charge e.

50
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:35,680
As the quark charge comes in at
only one of the two vertices,

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,971
we must introduce a factor Q_i^2 in
the cross section for each quark type i.

52
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,940
Second, quarks are produced with
three color charges, red, green or

53
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,460
blue, charges that are responsible for
the strong interactions but

54
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,290
to which electromagnetic
interactions are insensitive.

55
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,404
The color of quarks is another example of
the property of the final state which is

56
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,520
observable only in principle.

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,210
We have no way to measure it,

58
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,870
but it distinguishes nevertheless final states
corresponding to different colors.

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,570
We must therefore add the amplitudes
squared or the cross-sections.

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,000
These are obviously independent of color,
and for each flavor

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
we obtain a cross-section which depends
only on the electric charge, but

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,464
is three times larger than
if the object had no color.

63
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,890
The mass of quarks is negligible for u,
d, and s, but not for the heavy quarks c,

64
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,090
b, and especially t.

65
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,542
For them, their production thresholds,
as indicated on the bottom of the slide,

66
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:43,039
in the inclusive cross section
e+ e- -> q qbar,

67
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,435
there are steps at these thresholds.

68
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,427
Quarks in the final state are not
observed as such, because of

69
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:56,880
their strong interaction which starts
acting as soon as they are produced.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,678
The color field that is established
between them is so

71
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:04,486
energetic that additional quark-
antiquark pairs spontaneously pop-up and

72
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:08,540
cluster around the primordial
quark as hadronic jets.

73
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,970
You see an example in this picture
from the L3 experiment at LEP.

74
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,250
The jets follow the initial
direction of the quark.

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,110
Their total energy is that of the quarks.

76
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,560
The multiplicity of charged and
neutral particles inside each jet is high.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,200
Each quark forms at least one
jet such that the event contains

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,070
at least two of them.

79
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,390
We will come back to the jet phenomenon
in module 5 when we discuss

80
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,300
strong interactions.

81
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,990
Because of the conversion
of quarks into hadrons,

82
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,640
we cannot necessarily
differentiate their flavor either.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,470
We consider therefore often the inclusive
hadron cross section sigma(e+ e- -> hadrons),

84
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,160
which to first order is given by
the sum of the individual cross sections.

85
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,480
This again because in principle,
flavor allows to distinguish them.

86
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,120
You may wonder if the conversion
of quarks into hadron jets

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,150
does not change the cross-section.

88
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,820
This is not the case
because as far as we know,

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,760
this conversion is always happening,
it has probability one.

90
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,890
In other words, the quarks are always, and
without residues, converted into hadrons.

91
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,330
The cross section thus does not change.

92
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,520
To compensate for

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,480
the important reduction with the square of
the energy, proportional to 1/s,

94
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,315
of the electron positron cross-section,
we often form the ratio R of the hadronic

95
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:37,210
cross-section to that of our reference
process, e+ e- -> µ+ µ-.

96
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,870
The sum includes all flavors,
as indicated in this equation,

97
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,950
that can be produced at the given
energy in the center of mass frame.

98
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,645
To first order in the different
energy regions we just obtain simple

99
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,576
ratios of whole numbers.

100
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:57,446
At each threshold there is a step in
the cross section because a new channel

101
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,016
opens up.

102
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:05,846
This figure compares the rough calculation
that we just did to a compilation of

103
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:09,050
experimental results from
the particle data group.

104
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,910
The data comes from experiments at various
e+ e- colliders, at different energies.

105
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,300
We see the gross features of
the cross section as predicted,

106
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,720
including a small step
at the quark threshold.

107
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,846
But the measured cross section
are significantly larger than the simple

108
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,360
fractions we have just calculated.

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,970
This is again due to higher
order contributions.

110
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,587
We will see in the next module that
final states with additional gluons

111
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,910
add some 10% to the total
inclusive hadron cross-section.

112
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,800
At high energies,

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,910
above few tens of GeV, we see the
influence of the weak neutral interaction.

114
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,020
The exchange of its intermediate boson,

115
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,040
the Z boson, dominates the total
cross section at these energies, and

116
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,670
causes the big peak that you
see on the right of this graph.

117
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,760
We will see much more
of this in module 6.

118
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,501
But before that, in the next module
we'll discuss strong interactions and

119
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,575
hadronic structure.

120
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:07,881
