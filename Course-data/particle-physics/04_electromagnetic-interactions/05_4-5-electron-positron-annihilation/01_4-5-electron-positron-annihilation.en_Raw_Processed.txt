in this fourth module, we in 
process discussing properties 
electromagnetic interactions 
in this fifth video, 
we discuss annihilation 
electronpositron pairs 
pairs fermions 
following this video, you will know 
main properties process e e 
annihilation lepton pairs, 
also peculiarities 
annihilation hadrons 
annihilation electronpositron 
pairs pairs photons that mercedes 
introduced int previous video 
is annihilation reaction 
theres a whole class reactions 
electronpositron annihilation 
fermionantifermion pairs 
example is shown here 
we include reaction 
e e e e, 
is complicated a second 
scattering diagram two electrons 
exchange a photon rather annihilate 
let us take creation 
pairs muons a prototype 
in centerofmass frame final 
state is characterized two muons 
equal opposite momentum 
strong interactions 
heavy to cause 
electromagnetic showers, 
muons penetrate material in 
detector, losing energy dedx 
total cross section exhibits 
well known factors, alpha squared in 
nominator s, square 
characteristic energy, in denominator 
characteristic factors 
electromagnetic reactions 
between pointlike particles 
cross section tau production, 
e e tau tau, is same, 
far threshold, that is to say, 
s, much larger mtau 
differential cross section is 
symmetric respect to sign 
scattering angle theta, 
if one neglects masses, 
m 
figure shows angular distribution 
high energy, dashed lines indicate 
shape symmetric distribution 
predicted quantum electrodynamics 
solid lines include an asymmetric term 
that comes electroweak interference 
angular distribution in fact 
shows a deviation symmetry 
that increases energy 
is due to interference 
weak interactions 
that we will treat in module 
this prototype crosssection applies to 
annihilation reactions produce 
a fermion pair negligible mass 
charge e 
coupling constant is hidden 
in fine structure constant, 
alpha e 
again, an identical angular distribution 
is observed reaction 
e e tau tau energies much larger 
threshold this reaction 
let us turn to pair production 
quarks, rather 
quarkantiquark pairs e e annihilation 
here we must consider 
two important changes 
first, quarks carry electric charge, 
either 
u, c quarks 
d, s, 
b quarks, 
relative to elementary charge e 
quark charge comes in 
one two vertices, 
we must introduce a factor qi in 
cross section quark type i 
second, quarks produced 
three color charges, red, green 
blue, charges that responsible 
strong interactions 
to electromagnetic 
interactions insensitive 
color quarks is another example 
property final state is 
observable in principle 
we way to measure it, 
distinguishes nevertheless final states 
corresponding to different colors 
we must therefore add amplitudes 
squared crosssections 
obviously independent color, 
flavor 
we obtain a crosssection depends 
electric charge, 
is three times larger 
if object color 
mass quarks is negligible u, 
d, s, heavy quarks c, 
b, especially 
them, production thresholds, 
indicated bottom slide, 
in inclusive cross section 
e e q qbar, 
there steps thresholds 
quarks in final state 
observed such, 
strong interaction starts 
acting soon produced 
color field that is established 
between is so 
energetic that additional quark 
antiquark pairs spontaneously popup 
cluster around primordial 
quark hadronic jets 
you see an example in this picture 
l experiment lep 
jets follow initial 
direction quark 
total energy is that quarks 
multiplicity charged 
neutral particles inside jet is high 
quark forms least one 
jet that event contains 
least two 
we will come back to jet phenomenon 
in module we discuss 
strong interactions 
conversion 
quarks hadrons, 
we cannot necessarily 
differentiate flavor either 
we consider therefore often inclusive 
hadron cross section sigmae e hadrons, 
to first order is given 
sum individual cross sections 
this in principle, 
flavor allows to distinguish 
you may wonder if conversion 
quarks hadron jets 
change crosssection 
this is case 
far we know, 
this conversion is always happening, 
probability one 
in words, quarks always, 
without residues, converted hadrons 
cross section thus change 
to compensate 
important reduction square 
energy, proportional to s, 
electron positron crosssection, 
we often form ratio r hadronic 
crosssection to that reference 
process, e e 
sum includes flavors, 
indicated in this equation, 
that produced given 
energy in center mass frame 
to first order in different 
energy regions we obtain simple 
ratios whole numbers 
threshold there is a step in 
cross section a new channel 
opens 
this figure compares rough calculation 
that we to a compilation 
experimental results 
particle data group 
data comes experiments various 
e e colliders, different energies 
we see gross features 
cross section predicted, 
including a small step 
quark threshold 
measured cross section 
significantly larger simple 
fractions we calculated 
this is due to higher 
order contributions 
we will see in next module that 
final states additional gluons 
add to total 
inclusive hadron crosssection 
high energies, 
few tens gev, we see 
influence weak neutral interaction 
exchange intermediate boson, 
z boson, dominates total 
cross section energies, 
causes big peak that you 
see right this graph 
we will see much 
this in module 
that, in next module 
well discuss strong interactions 
hadronic structure
