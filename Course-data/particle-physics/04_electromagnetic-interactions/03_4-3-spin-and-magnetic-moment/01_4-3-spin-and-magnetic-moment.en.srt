2
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:12,327
During this fourth module,

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:15,530
we go into details about the properties
of electromagnetic interaction.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,450
In this third video,
we discussed the phenomenon of spin and

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,260
its consequences for
electromagnetic interactions.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,954
After following this video, you will know
spin as a typical quantum observable, and

7
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:32,265
its measurable consequences and the
functional principle of a Penning trap.

8
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:39,625
We have seen in video 1.1 that
the matter particles known up to

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,393
now are all fermions with spin one-half.

10
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:46,030
And the particles carrying the
forces are spin one bosons.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,740
The only elementary scalar boson
observed to date is the Higgs boson.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,180
It is therefore inevitable that we
discuss date spin in more depths.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,360
We will not do that
with a formal approach,

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,060
instead we discuss only
the consequences of spin.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,012
Spin is a typical quantum observable
which has no classical equivalent.

16
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:11,500
It is an intrinsic degree of freedom
corresponding to an angular momentum

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,580
manifesting itself by a magnetic moment.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,250
There's no movement associated to either
of these moments, let alone a rotation.

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,380
This is evident because spin is
a property of pointlike particles.

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,480
We will nevertheless use a classical
analogy laid out on this slide.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,960
For a particle with charge q and mass m,
the magnetic moment µ is related

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,320
to the angular momentum L by
µ = q/(2m) L.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,095
This is easy to see for
a particle traveling on a circle of radius r.

24
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:51,380
Its magnetic moment is the product of
the current caused by the motion and

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,270
the surface included in the path.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,640
The current can be expressed using
charge and angular velocity,

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,674
the magnetic moment is thus
proportionate to the angular momentum.

28
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:04,480
The proportionality factor is
simply q/(2m).

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,830
It is plausible that
an intrinsic angular momentum

30
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,267
would cause an analogous magnetic moment.

31
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:17,110
A new proportionality constant comes in,
it is called the gyromagnetic ratio g.

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,460
It's value depends on the internal
structure of the particle.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,440
For a pointlike fermion,
such as the electron, muon or tau,

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,610
the spin is one-half,
the charge is -e,

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,529
so µ is equal to -ge/(4m).

36
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:38,216
A QED calculation to first order
gives g simply equal to two.

37
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:44,289
The classical experiment to measure
g uses an electron trapped in

38
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,410
an electromagnetic bottle
called a Penning Trap.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,590
A very good description is available
in the article by Ekstrom and

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,040
Wineland, in Scientific American,
that is quoted on the bottom of this page.

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,650
The system resembles a macroscopic

42
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,210
atom where the nucleus is
replaced by an external field.

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,740
The electron circulates
in a magnetic field

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,970
which is pretty much homogeneous except
for the focusing component generated

45
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,689
by a ferromagnetic nickel
ring in the equatorial plane.

46
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,630
An electric field counteracts excursions
along the axis of the magnetic field.

47
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,700
It is generated by a ring electrode and
two cap electrodes.

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,236
We calculate the energy levels
of such a system in video 4.3a.

49
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:38,552
The result which is given here,
neglecting the focusing effects of the ring

50
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,150
the caps, is relatively simple.

51
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,850
The first term in blue corresponds to
a free movement in the z direction.

52
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,820
This movement is constraint by
the focusing components we have neglected.

53
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,840
And they caused the axial oscillation.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,690
The two terms in red correspond to
harmonic oscillator in the equatorial

55
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,020
plane with energy
eigenvalues which are 

56
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,860
omega times (n+1/2) for
n equal to zero, one, two and so on.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,610
Adding the magnetic moment of the spin µ_s,
the last term in green is obtained.

58
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,188
The two directions of spin, 
s_z equal plus one-half and

59
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:22,171
minus one-half, are therefore separated
by the same energy difference omega as

60
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:25,680
the main levels, provided that
g is exactly equal to two.

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,704
The energy levels for spin parallel and

62
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:34,210
anti-parallel to z would then be
displaced by exactly one step omega.

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,287
This degeneracy does not exist if
the value of g differs from two.

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,319
The levels are then slightly displaced
by a frequency shift delta omega

65
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,223
equal to omega times (g-2)/2,

66
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:51,673
which can be measured with impressive
accuracy using a Penning trap.

67
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:58,300
The principle of the measurement is
shown here by its electrical analogue.

68
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,340
In an empty trap, the three
electrodes form a capacitance network

69
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,320
that transmits the AC signal generated
on top to the detector on the bottom.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,760
The trapped electron introduces
an additional capacitance-inductance

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,180
in the circuit.

72
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,020
The amplitude of the transmitting signal
as a function of frequency thus indicates

73
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,060
the number of electrons in the device.

74
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,500
And the frequency shift delta
omega which determines the deviation

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,490
of g from two.

76
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,540
The figure on the left shows the detected
signal as a function of time

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,750
at the well adjusted frequency.

78
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,490
Each major step corresponds to
the loss of one electron in the trap.

79
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,878
The right figure shows the frequency shift
delta omega as a function of time.

80
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,180
It's too minima indicate
the two directions of spin.

81
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,630
Also indicated are the much larger
shifts due to a change in orbit.

82
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,440
The precidion of the experimental
result is amazing.

83
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,420
You see the value obtained in
blue on the bottom of the page.

84
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,100
The value in bracket indicates
the measurement error

85
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,790
which applies to the 13th and
14th decimal places.

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,070
Comparison of this value to
electromagnetic theory requires

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,720
a calculation of the same quantity to
10th order in the pertubation expansion.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,390
One finds good agreement
between measurement and

89
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,460
theory even at this unrivalled precision.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,805
The measurement also gives us one of the
most precise values of the fine structure

91
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:35,160
constant alpha equals e^2/(4π).

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,199
In the next video, Mercedes
will discuss Compton scattering,

93
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,991
the elastic scattering of
a photon off an electron.

94
