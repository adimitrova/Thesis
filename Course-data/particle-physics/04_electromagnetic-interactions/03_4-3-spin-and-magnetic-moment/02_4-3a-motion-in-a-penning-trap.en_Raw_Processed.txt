we will calculate motion 
electrons in a penning trap like 
one shown in this small sketch 
moment we will neglect 
influence slight 
inhomogeneity magnetic field 
caused nickel ring, 
electric field cap electodes 
if b points in z direction 
follows a vector potential equal to 
by,, 
so hamiltonian a system 
using minimal substitution 
is m p ea 
so a bit trivial mathematics, 
we find mp 
m omega y px m omega y 
if you write this in terms 
cartesian components momentum, 
we find that terms proportional 
to px joined together 
remaining term is pzm, 
corresponds to a uniform motion 
in this z direction, in reality, 
will limited cap electrodes 
two terms correspond to a 
harmonic oscillation in xy plane 
energy levels 
this oscillation equal to 
omegan n a whole number, , 
, , so 
we take account 
a spin electron 
hamiltonian acquires a term 
b is 
magnetic moment electron 
b is magnetic field vector 
so this gives an additional splitting 
plus minus ge ebm 
this last term is g times 
frequency we found earlier 
energies corresponding 
to two spin directions 
differ en plus 
minus ge times omega 
this results in a level spacing due to 
spin ge times omega compared 
to one level spacing cyclotron 
motion is en omega 
difference between 
two level spacings 
directly measures ge
