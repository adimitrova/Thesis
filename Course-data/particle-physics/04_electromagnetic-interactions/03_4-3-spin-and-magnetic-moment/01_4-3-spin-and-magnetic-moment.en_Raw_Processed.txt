this fourth module, 
we go details properties 
electromagnetic interaction 
in this third video, 
we discussed phenomenon spin 
consequences 
electromagnetic interactions 
following this video, you will know 
spin a typical quantum observable, 
measurable consequences 
functional principle a penning trap 
we seen in video that 
matter particles known to 
fermions spin onehalf 
particles carrying 
forces spin one bosons 
elementary scalar boson 
observed to date is higgs boson 
is therefore inevitable that we 
discuss date spin in depths 
we will that 
a formal approach, 
instead we discuss 
consequences spin 
spin is a typical quantum observable 
classical equivalent 
is an intrinsic degree freedom 
corresponding to an angular momentum 
manifesting a magnetic moment 
theres movement associated to either 
moments, let alone a rotation 
this is evident spin is 
a property pointlike particles 
we will nevertheless use a classical 
analogy laid this slide 
a particle charge q mass m, 
magnetic moment is related 
to angular momentum l 
qm l 
this is easy to see 
a particle traveling a circle radius r 
magnetic moment is product 
current caused motion 
surface included in path 
current expressed using 
charge angular velocity, 
magnetic moment is thus 
proportionate to angular momentum 
proportionality factor is 
simply qm 
is plausible that 
an intrinsic angular momentum 
would cause an analogous magnetic moment 
a new proportionality constant comes in, 
is called gyromagnetic ratio g 
value depends internal 
structure particle 
a pointlike fermion, 
electron, muon tau, 
spin is onehalf, 
charge is e, 
so is equal to gem 
a qed calculation to first order 
gives g simply equal to two 
classical experiment to measure 
g uses an electron trapped in 
an electromagnetic bottle 
called a penning trap 
a good description is available 
in article ekstrom 
wineland, in scientific american, 
that is quoted bottom this page 
system resembles a macroscopic 
atom nucleus is 
replaced an external field 
electron circulates 
in a magnetic field 
is pretty much homogeneous except 
focusing component generated 
a ferromagnetic nickel 
ring in equatorial plane 
an electric field counteracts excursions 
along axis magnetic field 
is generated a ring electrode 
two cap electrodes 
we calculate energy levels 
a system in video a 
result is given here, 
neglecting focusing effects ring 
caps, is relatively simple 
first term in blue corresponds to 
a free movement in z direction 
this movement is constraint 
focusing components we neglected 
caused axial oscillation 
two terms in red correspond to 
harmonic oscillator in equatorial 
plane energy 
eigenvalues 
omega times n 
n equal to zero, one, two so 
adding magnetic moment spin s, 
last term in green is obtained 
two directions spin, 
sz equal plus onehalf 
minus onehalf, therefore separated 
energy difference omega 
main levels, provided that 
g is exactly equal to two 
energy levels spin parallel 
antiparallel to z would 
displaced exactly one step omega 
this degeneracy exist if 
value g differs two 
levels slightly displaced 
a frequency shift delta omega 
equal to omega times g, 
measured impressive 
accuracy using a penning trap 
principle measurement is 
shown here electrical analogue 
in an empty trap, three 
electrodes form a capacitance network 
that transmits ac signal generated 
top to detector bottom 
trapped electron introduces 
an additional capacitanceinductance 
in circuit 
amplitude transmitting signal 
a function frequency thus indicates 
number electrons in device 
frequency shift delta 
omega determines deviation 
g two 
figure left shows detected 
signal a function time 
well adjusted frequency 
major step corresponds to 
loss one electron in trap 
right figure shows frequency shift 
delta omega a function time 
minima indicate 
two directions spin 
also indicated much larger 
shifts due to a change in orbit 
precidion experimental 
result is amazing 
you see value obtained in 
blue bottom page 
value in bracket indicates 
measurement error 
applies to th 
th decimal places 
comparison this value to 
electromagnetic theory requires 
a calculation quantity to 
th order in pertubation expansion 
one finds good agreement 
between measurement 
theory even this unrivalled precision 
measurement also gives us one 
precise values fine structure 
constant alpha equals e 
in next video, mercedes 
will discuss compton scattering, 
elastic scattering 
a photon an electron
