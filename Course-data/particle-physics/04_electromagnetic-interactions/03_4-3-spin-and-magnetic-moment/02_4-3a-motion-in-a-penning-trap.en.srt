00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,666
We will calculate the motion of
electrons in a Penning trap like

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,565
the one shown in this small sketch.

4
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:20,355
For the moment we will neglect
the influence of the slight

5
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:24,915
inhomogeneity of the magnetic field
caused by the nickel ring, and

6
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,115
the electric field of the cap electodes.

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:33,165
If B points in the z direction it
follows from a vector potential equal to

8
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:33,805
(-By,0,0).

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,590
So the Hamiltonian of such a system
using minimal substitution

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,640
is 1/(2m) (p - eA)^2.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,330
So with a bit of trivial mathematics,
we find 1/(2m)(p + 

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,350
2m omega y p_x + m^2 omega^2 y^2).

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,980
If you write this in terms of
Cartesian components of the momentum,

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,240
we find that all the terms proportional
to p_x can be joined together and

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,160
the remaining term is p_z^2/(2m),
which corresponds to a uniform motion

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,290
in this z direction, which in reality,
will be limited by the cap electrodes.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,530
The other two terms correspond to a
harmonic oscillation in the x-y plane.

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,548
The energy levels for
this oscillation are equal to 

19
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:31,030
omega(n+1/2) with n a whole number, 0,
1, 2, and so on.

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,572
We now take into account
a spin of the electron.

21
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:41,368
The Hamiltonian acquires a term
µ_s B where µ_s is

22
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,180
the magnetic moment of the electron and
B is the magnetic field vector.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,680
So this gives an additional splitting
by plus or minus g_e (eB)/(4m).

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,370
This last term is g/4 times the same
frequency which we had found earlier.

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,030
The energies corresponding
to these two spin directions

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,490
differ from E_n by plus or
minus g_e/4 times omega.

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,690
This results in a level spacing due to
spin of g_e/2 times omega compared

28
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,630
to one level spacing by the cyclotron
motion which is ∆E_n = omega.

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,990
The difference between
these two level spacings

30
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,664
directly measures (g_e - 2)/2.

31
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:38,919
