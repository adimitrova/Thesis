details properties 
electromagnetic interactions 
in this second video, electromagnetic 
scattering is analyzed in terms 
invariant amplitudes cross section 
following this video you 
will know fermis golden rule 
scattering amplitude a particle 
in an electromagnetic potential, 
target particle 
generates this potential 
difference between distinguishable 
undistinguishable processes 
in previous video we seen 
cross section a scattering process is 
measured normalizing reaction 
rate luminosity 
one incoming projectile 
a single target particle, 
crosssection is 
also calculable quantity 
main ingredient is, again, 
probability that interact 
exchanging an intermediate gauge boson 
this probability, rather amplitude, 
is calculable in a quantum field 
theory based a gauge principle 
one thus compare experiment 
theory in good precision 
comparison test theory 
determine is parameters like masses 
coupling constants 
prescription 
calculation a crosssection 
is called fermis golden rule 
in scattering theory 
reaction rate, w, 
is given product between 
m times q, 
invariant scattering amplitude m 
density final state q 
latter is also called 
phase space factor 
takes account number 
states, in quantum sense, 
that final state contain 
there are, 
probable reaction becomes 
a four body reaction a b c d, 
amplitude m interpreted 
probability amplitude 
process that converts initial 
states final state 
is therefore a probability amplitude 
in sense wave function, 
square is a probability density 
to obtain cross section we still 
to normalize flux 
incident projectiles 
this may seem surprising 
a single projectile, 
flux is number projectiles 
per second per unit surface 
here is fermis golden rule 
cross sections 
is obtained properly normalizing 
probability reaction, 
contains this probability 
m, incoming flux f, 
phase space factor q 
incident flux initial state 
depends relative velocity, 
modulus va vb, 
volume density projectile 
target 
this volume density must 
proportional to energy 
two particles to 
relatively equally invariant 
in normalization, is simply 
equal to twice energy 
a single particle per unit volume 
second equation is valid 
two velocities, va vb, parallel 
clearly shows invariance flux 
factor lorentz transformations 
phase space factor, dq, 
takes account number states 
realized final state 
contains a delta function that ensures 
conservation energymomentum, 
well number quantum states 
particles in final state 
factors twice energies, again, 
come way we normalize 
wave functions 
one proceed to calculate 
invariant amplitude 
we will outline argument 
this simple case scalar fields 
we mentioned that to first order 
one local action potential 
vx will transform initial state 
phia final state phic 
probability amplitude this process, 
ignoring normalization factors 
moment, is given this integral 
argument integral is 
probability finding state 
phic position x time 
among states produced potential 
v initial state phia 
integration spacetime 
reflects fact that this local 
interaction occur wherever 
potential is present 
to help intuition, imagine 
that two wave functions phia 
phic correspond to free particles 
everywhere, except place 
time potential intervenes 
initial state phia will 
a superposition eigenstates 
free hamiltonial 
a given set coefficients 
potential will change coefficients 
to produce another superposition 
eigenstates a different 
set coefficients 
amplitude m is 
amplitude 
final state phic, 
contains new mixture 
invariant amplitude m contains 
dynamics a reaction, 
thus whole physics type 
interaction study 
therefore follows 
potential operator v 
this is operator changes 
homogenous equation motion 
an inhomogenous ones 
electromagnetic interactions, 
inhomogeneous equation is derived 
kleingordon equation socalled 
minimal substitution to struct this 
potential will neglect terms proportional to 
e is 
much smaller one 
invariant amplitude is given 
an integral product 
fourpotential target, 
current density j 
projectile 
invariant amplitude 
electromagnetic scattering a fixed 
target is thus integral 
product between transition current 
projectile electromagnetic 
potential target 
note that this is a local interaction 
current potential defined 
point in spacetime 
this point may anywhere 
thus an integral spacetime 
gives us total amplitude 
electromagnetic current density 
work here looks like that 
a free particle, 
except that fields in initial 
final states 
since there an interaction 
so electromagnetic current density 
interacts locally potential a, 
we identify photon field 
remains to understood 
this potential is generated 
that is, photon is produced 
electromagnetic interaction, 
maxwell equations tell us 
electromagnetic fields 
produced charges currents 
let us start writing 
homogeneous maxwell equations in 
fourvector form, using electromagnetic 
field tensor fmunu translating equations 
potential this gives four differential 
equations fourpotential anu 
using invariance potential 
gauge transformations 
an arbitrary scalar field xix, 
we always rearrange things so 
that a a divergence 
we call this arrangement lorenz gauge 
in this gauge homogeneous maxwell 
equations nothing else four 
kleingordon equations 
components potential 
three components 
independent 
gauge condition 
this justifies that we consider 
homogeneous maxwell equations 
equation motion 
photon, is a vector boson 
thus three independent components 
in presence a current, 
equations become inhomogeneous 
there is a source j, right 
we construct j wave 
function two 
partners in reaction, 
target particle b final state d 
transition current 
is source field 
potential a that corresponds to this 
situation is proportional to this current 
density inversely proportion to 
square transfered momentum q 
invariant amplitude thus corresponds 
to interaction between two currents 
intervening factor q 
is called photon propagator 
described probability 
amplitude that a photon 
fourmomentum q is exchanged 
between two currents 
since current density brings in 
a factor e a calling constant 
amplitude is proportional 
to eq 
this process represented 
a feynman diagram shown in this slide 
diagrams describe elementary 
processes in a manner that is 
elegant intuitive 
if construction feynman diagram 
a given process is still a problem 
you, please go back to 
optional video a 
time feynman 
diagrams a prescription 
corresponding invariant amplitude 
vertices characterized 
coupling constant, 
electric charge in case 
electromagnetic interactions, 
an operator describes 
properties interactions 
lines correspond to propagators particles, 
real ones external lines, 
virtual ones internal lines connecting two vertices 
propagator q we 
found photon is a special case 
general one, is 
q minus square mass 
massive intermediate vector bosons 
if one elementary process 
cause a reaction we must 
either add amplitudes 
crosssections 
quantum nature 
processes there exist two cases 
if initial final states 
processes indistinguishable, 
one must add amplitudes 
if there is an observable, 
allows in principle to distinguish 
different contributions, matter if 
is actually measured not, 
processes distinguishable 
one must sum cross sections 
first case occurs course 
example if one considers two 
contribution different orders 
in coupling constant 
exchange one two photons 
intervene between 
initial final state shown 
in picture in left 
if two amplitudes m, m describe 
two contributions, square 
total amplitude, leads 
to cross section, 
is m m mm 
is m m mm 
so this last term is an 
interference term 
appears in probability 
this is precisely case if 
processes distinguishable in principle 
take example different 
spin directions particles 
that interact 
observable in principle 
in example shown in right, 
an unpolarized initial 
state corresponds to a mixture 
possible spin orientations 
in equal proportion 
we must therefore average 
crosssection 
squared amplitude spin 
direction initial particles to 
calculate crosssection 
an unpolarized initial state 
if one distinguish 
polarization particles 
in final state either, one must 
sum crosssection corresponding 
to spin direction 
final state particles 
square amplitude resulting 
operations, 
averaging initial spin 
summing final spin, 
is denoted mbar

spin consequences in depth
