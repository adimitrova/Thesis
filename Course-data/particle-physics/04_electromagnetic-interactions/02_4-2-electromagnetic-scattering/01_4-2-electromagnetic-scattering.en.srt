2
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:12,872
During this fourth module
we're going into more

3
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:17,930
details on the properties of
electromagnetic interactions.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,250
In this second video, electromagnetic
scattering is analyzed in terms of

5
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,637
invariant amplitudes and cross section.

6
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:29,410
After following this video you
will know Fermi's Golden Rule.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,360
The scattering amplitude of a particle
in an electromagnetic potential,

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,530
how the target particle
generates this potential and

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,439
the difference between distinguishable and
undistinguishable processes.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,830
In the previous video we have seen how the
cross section for a scattering process is

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,280
measured by normalizing the reaction
rate by the luminosity.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,640
For one incoming projectile
on a single target particle,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,540
the cross-section is
also calculable quantity.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,000
The main ingredient is, again,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,300
the probability that both interact by
exchanging an intermediate gauge boson.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,740
This probability, or rather its amplitude,

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,780
is calculable in a quantum field
theory based on a gauge principle.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,776
One can thus compare experiment and
theory in good precision for both.

19
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:22,721
Such comparison can test the theory and

20
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:27,934
determine is parameters like masses and
coupling constants.

21
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,774
The prescription for

22
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:36,270
the calculation of a cross-section
is called Fermi's Golden Rule.

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,150
In scattering theory
the reaction rate, W,

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,750
is given as the product between
|M|^2 times Q,

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,825
with invariant scattering amplitude M and
the density of final state Q.

26
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,915
The latter is also called
the phase space factor.

27
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:56,795
It takes into account the number
of states, in the quantum sense,

28
00:01:56,795 --> 00:02:00,595
that the final state can contain. 
The more there are,

29
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:02,970
the more probable the reaction becomes.

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,560
For a four body reaction a + b -> c + d,

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,000
the amplitude M can be interpreted
as the probability amplitude

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,210
of the process that converts the initial
states into the final state.

33
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,980
It is therefore a probability amplitude
in the same sense as the wave function,

34
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,350
and its square is a probability density.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,470
To obtain the cross section we still have

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,280
to normalize by the flux
of incident projectiles.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,010
This may seem surprising for
a single projectile, but

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,571
the flux is the number of projectiles
per second and per unit surface.

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Here is then Fermi's Golden Rule for
cross sections.

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,565
It is obtained by properly normalizing
the probability of the reaction,

41
00:02:55,565 --> 00:03:00,803
and contains both this probability
|M|^2, the incoming flux F,

42
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:03,000
and the phase space factor Q.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,380
The incident flux for the initial state
depends on the relative velocity,

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,380
the modulus of (v_a- v_b),

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,800
and the volume density of projectile and
target.

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
This volume density must be
proportional to the energy

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,267
of the two particles to be
relatively equally invariant.

48
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:26,550
In our normalization, it is simply
equal to twice the energy for

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,380
a single particle per unit volume.

50
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,890
The second equation is valid for
the two velocities, v_a and v_b, parallel.

51
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,150
and clearly shows the invariance of the flux
factor under Lorentz transformations.

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,420
The phase space factor, dQ,

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,900
takes into account the number of states
which can be realized by the final state.

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,900
It contains a delta function that ensures
the conservation of the energy-momentum,

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,470
as well as the number of quantum states
for all the particles in the final state.

56
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,726
The factors of twice the energies, again,

57
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:08,600
come from the way we normalize
the wave functions.

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,860
How does one proceed to calculate
the invariant amplitude?

59
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,560
We will outline the argument for
this simple case of scalar fields.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,767
We mentioned that to first order
one local action of the potential

61
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:29,807
V(x) will transform the initial state
Phi_a into the final state Phi_c.

62
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:35,659
The probability amplitude of this process,
ignoring the normalization factors for

63
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,880
the moment, is given by this integral.

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,665
The argument of the integral is
the probability of finding the state 

65
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:47,655
Phi_c at position x at the time t

66
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:52,558
among all states produced by the potential
V from the initial state of Phi_a.

67
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,118
The integration over space-time
reflects the fact that this local

68
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:01,120
interaction can occur wherever
the potential is present.

69
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,040
To help your intuition, imagine
that the two wave functions Phi_a and

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,940
Phi_c correspond to free particles
everywhere, except at the place and

71
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,760
time where the potential intervenes.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,660
The initial state Phi_a will
be a superposition of eigenstates

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,610
of the free Hamiltonial with
a given set of coefficients.

74
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,530
The potential will change these coefficients
to produce another superposition

75
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,770
of eigenstates with a different
set of coefficients.

76
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,241
The amplitude M is then
just the amplitude of

77
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:41,339
the final state Phi_c,
which contains the new mixture.

78
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:49,130
The invariant amplitude M contains
all the dynamics of a reaction,

79
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,830
Thus the whole physics of the type
of interaction under study.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,390
It therefore follows from
the potential operator V.

81
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,310
This is the same operator which changes
the homogenous equation of motion

82
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,890
into an inhomogenous ones.

83
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,372
For electromagnetic interactions,

84
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:08,659
the inhomogeneous equation is derived
from the Klein-Gordon equation by the so-called

85
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,760
minimal substitution. To struct this
potential will neglect terms proportional to

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
e^2 which is very
much smaller than one.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,364
The invariant amplitude is then given by
an integral over the product of the 

88
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:27,160
four-potential of the target, and

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,226
the current density j_µ of
the projectile.

90
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:38,734
The invariant amplitude of
electromagnetic scattering off a fixed

91
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:43,458
target is thus the integral over
the product between the transition current

92
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:47,760
of the projectile and the electromagnetic
potential of the target.

93
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,460
Note that this is a local interaction.

94
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,240
Current and potential are defined
at the same point in space-time.

95
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,355
But this point may be anywhere.

96
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:02,780
Thus an integral over space-time
gives us the total amplitude.

97
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,730
The electromagnetic current density
at work here looks like that for

98
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,980
a free particle,

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,780
except that the fields in the initial and

100
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,620
final states are not the same
since there was an interaction.

101
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,400
So the electromagnetic current density
interacts locally with the potential A^µ,

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,460
which we identify with the photon field.

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,150
It remains to be understood how
this potential is generated.

104
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,870
That is, how the photon is produced?

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,150
For electromagnetic interaction,
the Maxwell equations tell us how

106
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,370
the electromagnetic fields
are produced by charges and currents.

107
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,392
Let us start by writing down
the homogeneous Maxwell equations in

108
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:55,368
four-vector form, using the electromagnetic
field tensor F^munu. Translating into equations for

109
00:07:55,368 --> 00:08:01,810
the potential this gives four differential
equations for the four-potential A^nu.

110
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,820
Using the invariance of the potential under

111
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,292
the gauge transformations with
an arbitrary scalar field xi(x),

112
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:14,290
we can always rearrange things so
that a A^µ has no divergence.

113
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,950
We call this arrangement the Lorenz gauge.

114
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,864
In this gauge the homogeneous Maxwell
equations are nothing else than four

115
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:26,520
Klein-Gordon equations for
the components of the potential.

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,520
But only three components
are independent of each other because

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,530
of the gauge condition.

118
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,680
This justifies that we consider
the homogeneous Maxwell equations

119
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,140
as the equation of motion for
the photon, which is a vector boson and

120
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,980
thus has three independent components.

121
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,015
In the presence of a current,
the equations become inhomogeneous.

122
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,462
There is a source j_µ, on the right.

123
00:08:55,462 --> 00:09:00,085
We construct j_µ from the wave
function of the two other

124
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:06,070
partners in the reaction,
the target particle b and its final state d.

125
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,620
Their transition current
is the source of the field.

126
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,029
The potential A_µ that corresponds to this
situation is proportional to this current

127
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,204
density and inversely proportion to
the square of the transfered momentum q.

128
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:23,263
The invariant amplitude thus corresponds
to the interaction between two currents.

129
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:30,873
The intervening factor 1/q^2
is called the photon propagator.

130
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:35,992
It described the probability
amplitude that a photon with

131
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:41,840
four-momentum q is exchanged
between the two currents.

132
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,670
Since each current density brings in
a factor of e as a calling constant

133
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,400
the amplitude is proportional
to e^2/q^2.

134
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,660
This process can be represented by
a feynman diagram as shown in this slide.

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,640
These diagrams describe elementary
processes in a manner that is both

136
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,940
elegant and intuitive.

137
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,712
If the construction of the Feynman diagram
for a given process is still a problem for

138
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:13,806
you, please go back to
the optional video 4.1a.

139
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:17,616
At the same time Feynman
diagrams are a prescription for

140
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:20,523
the corresponding invariant amplitude.

141
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:23,936
The vertices are characterized
by coupling constant,

142
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:27,989
the electric charge in the case
of electromagnetic interactions,

143
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:32,197
and an operator which describes
the properties of the interactions.

144
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:37,058
The lines correspond to the propagators of particles,

145
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:43,499
real ones for external lines,
virtual ones for internal lines connecting two vertices.

146
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:49,184
The propagator 1/q^2 we
found for the photon is a special case for

147
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:56,428
the more general one, which is 
1/(q^2 minus the square of the mass) 

148
00:10:56,428 --> 00:11:00,350
for massive intermediate vector bosons.

149
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,990
If more than one elementary process
can cause a reaction we must

150
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,170
either add the amplitudes or
the cross-sections.

151
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,670
Because of the quantum nature of
the processes there exist two cases.

152
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,977
If initial and final states of
the processes are indistinguishable,

153
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,770
one must add the amplitudes.

154
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,840
If there is an observable,
which allows in principle to distinguish

155
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,320
different contributions, no matter if
it is actually measured or not,

156
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,780
these processes are distinguishable and
one must then sum the cross sections.

157
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,100
The first case occurs of course for
example if one considers two

158
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,700
contribution of different orders
in the coupling constant.

159
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,840
The exchange of one of two photons
can intervene between the

160
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,750
same initial final state as shown
in the picture in the left.

161
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,456
If the two amplitudes M_1, M_2 describe
the two contributions, the square of

162
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,694
the total amplitude, which leads
to the cross section,

163
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:10,815
is then |M_1|^2 + |M_2|^2 + 2M_1M_2.

164
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:16,335
is then |M_1|^2 + |M_2|^2 + 2M_1M_2.

165
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:20,155
So this last term is an
interference term

166
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,705
with appears in the probability.

167
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:28,720
This is precisely not the case if
the processes are distinguishable in principle.

168
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,180
Take the example of different
spin directions of the particles

169
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,300
that interact.

170
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,320
These are observable in principle.

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,410
As in the example shown in the right, 

172
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,475
an unpolarized initial
state corresponds to a mixture

173
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:48,955
of all possible spin orientations
in equal proportion.

174
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,045
We must therefore average
the cross-section or

175
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:56,995
the squared amplitude over the spin
direction of the initial particles to

176
00:12:56,995 --> 00:13:01,315
calculate the cross-section for
an unpolarized initial state.

177
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,290
If one does not distinguish
the polarization of particles

178
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,950
in the final state either, one must
sum the cross-section corresponding

179
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,930
to the spin direction of
the final state particles.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,290
The square of the amplitude resulting from
both operations,

181
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,920
averaging over initial spin and
summing over final spin,

182
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,870
is denoted by |M|^2-bar.

183
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,727
In the next video we'll discuss fermion
spin and its consequences in more depth.
