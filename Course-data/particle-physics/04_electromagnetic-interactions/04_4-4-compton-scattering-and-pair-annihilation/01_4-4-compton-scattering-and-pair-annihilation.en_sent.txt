[music] during this fourth module, we are going into more details about the properties of electromagnetic interactions.
in this fourth video, we describe compton scattering, which we already encountered in module 3 when we discussed the interaction of photons and matter.
after following this video, you will be able to characterize compton scattering, which is the elastic scattering between a photon and an electron.
describe how the polarization of the photon influences the process, and understand why the annihilation of electron- positron pairs into photons has similar properties.
we have not yet discussed that vector bosons, which carry forces, can also appear as real particles, and matter particles as virtual ones.
compton scattering, elastic scattering between a photon and an electron, involves a virtual intermediate electron, as shown in this feynman diagram.
the kinematics of the process is characterized by the energy omega of the incident photon and the scattering angle theta, the angle between k and k prime, which are the four-momenta of the incidence photon and the outgoing photon, respectively.
the conservation of energy-momentum reduces the energy, omega prime, of the outgoing photon compared to that of the incident one, omega, if the reaction occurs on an electron at rest.
the reduction depends on the scattering angle theta and the photon energy itself.
the figure gives an example of this relationship for a source of am-241, which emits photon with omega = 59.54 kev.
because of heisenberg's principle, we can in fact, not know whether the photon in the final state is emitted after or before the absorption of the incident photon.
so there are two configurations of the feynman diagram which are indistinguishable.
the processes can interfere with one another.
to calculate the cross section, we must then add the amplitudes and square the result, as we explained in video 4.2. for the differencial across cross-section, one finds the so-called klein-nishina formula.
two factors are of particular interest.
the first is the factor alpha squared, which determines the order of magnitude of the cross section.
it result from the fact that each vertex introduces a factor of e when constructing the invariant amplitude m. consequently, the cross-section, which is proportional to |m|^2, which is proportional to the fourth power of e, is proportional to the square of the fine structure constant alpha.
the second interesting factor involves the product of two four vector of photon polarization, epsilon and epsilon prime.
these appear as the amplitude in the wave function of the free photon, which is the solution of the homogeneous maxwell equations.
under the lorenz gauge, these equations of motion constrain epsilon such that k^2 = 0, which is the condition for a real photon.
the gauge condition, â_âµ a^âµ = 0, means that epsilon^âµ k_âµ = 0. the four-vector of polarization epsilon, indicating the electric field direction, is thus orthogonal to the four-momentum of the free photon k. in addition, this gauge condition shows that the photon will function as only three independent components, not four.
it is therefore justified to call the photon a vector particle.
when the polarization of the initial state is 0, and that of the final state is not measured, we must average the cross-section over the direction of the initial spins, and sum over those of the final state.
this must be done at the level of the cross-sections, not of the amplitudes, because the spin is an observable, making the contributions distinguishable as we discussed in video 4.2. for the factor containing the polarization this results in a distribution (1 + cos^2 theta) of the scattering angle theta between the incoming and outgoing photons.
at high photon energy omega much larger than m, the total cross-section is roughly inversely proportional to the square s of the total initial energy.
this is a property shared by all scattering processes between point-like particles.
their cross-section decreases with the square of the energy scale, which characterizes the process.
obviously, the square of the fine structure constant alpha, again determines the order of magnitude of the cross section.
compton scattering can be measured at high energies using the large electron- positron collider, lep, at cern, which operated during the 80s and 90s.
the incident photon beam is generated by the incoming electrons via the bremsstrahlung mechanism.
an accelerated charge  tends to emit photons.
here the acceleration is caused by the electromagnetic force coming from the particles in the other beam.
the electron or positron emits a photon in its original direction of motion.
the photon interacts with a positron or electron n the other beam, via compton scattering.
the outgoing electron and photon are observed in the detector.
as the initial photon connects two vertices it is a virtual photon with k^2 different from 0. our treatment of the compton effect applies to real photons with a k^2 = 0. to apply it to this case, we select events for which the mass of the initial photon is negligible compared to the characteristic energy, that is to say k^2 << s. the cross-section for compton scattering with this quasi real photons measured by the experiment  l3 at lep is shown on the right.
the dependence on the initial energy square root of s predicted by the calculation is in fact observed.
it is proportional to 1/s.
rotating the compton scattering feynman diagram by 90 degrees, one obtains another process.
the annihilation of an electron- positron pair into a pair of photons.
notice that we also convert the outgoing electron of the compton process into an incoming positron.
this remains without consequence because these two states are completely equivalent.
we will come back to that in the beginning of module 6 when we discuss antiparticles in more details.
with the appropriate changes in the kinematic variables, we can convert to the compton scattering result directly into the cross-section for pair annihilation in the center of mass frame and neglecting masses, for s much larger than the square of the electron mass.
note again the characteristic factor, alpha squared, which comes from the coupling constants, and 1/s, which characterizes the square of the energy available in the process.
we have chosen the center of mass frame where the electron and positron collide with equal and opposite momenta.
the photons are therefore also emitted with equal and opposite momenta.
the scattering angle theta is the angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing photons.
it is obvious that the angular distribution is symmetric under theta going to theta plus ï.
the factor (1 - cos^2 theta) in the denominator can come as a surprise, because it makes the cross section diverge when the scattering angle approaches 0 or 180 degrees.
such divergence is not admissible.
the cross action that represent the probability must always respect the upper limit of unitarity corresponding to a probability of 1 for the process.
already the factor 1/s looks suspicious, but the dangerous limit, s -> 0, cannot be reached because of the threshold  s > 4 m_e^2.
the angular divergence on the other hand is real.
it is finally not realized, because of higher order corrections which cancel it.
in fact, the perturbative expansion by orders of a small coupling constant, always ends up converging in a quantum field theory based on the principles of gauge invariance.
the demonstration of this fact has been rewarded by nobel prize in 1999 for tâhooft and veltman.
in fact, the cross section is always really a finite quantity.
the figure shows the results of the measurement by the l3 experiment at lep.
the cross section follows with great precision in absolute magnitude and in energy dependence, the prediction of quantum electrodynamics.
in the next video, we give an example of an  electromagnetic interaction between four fermions, e+ e- annihilation into a fermion-antifermion pair.
