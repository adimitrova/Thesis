2
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:15,258
During this fourth module,
we are going into more details

3
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:20,790
about the properties of
electromagnetic interactions.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,838
In this fourth video, we describe Compton
scattering, which we already encountered

5
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:32,050
in module 3 when we discussed
the interaction of photons and matter.

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,050
After following this video,

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,880
you will be able to characterize
Compton scattering,

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,430
which is the elastic scattering
between a photon and an electron.

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,492
Describe how the polarization of
the photon influences the process,

10
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:53,808
and understand why the
annihilation of electron-

11
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:58,505
positron pairs into photons
has similar properties.

12
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:04,750
We have not yet discussed that vector
bosons, which carry forces, can also appear

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,083
as real particles, and
matter particles as virtual ones.

14
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:13,728
Compton scattering, elastic scattering
between a photon and an electron,

15
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,520
involves a virtual intermediate electron,
as shown in this Feynman diagram.

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,150
The kinematics of the process is
characterized by the energy omega

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,450
of the incident photon and
the scattering angle theta,

18
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,810
the angle between k and k prime,
which are the four-momenta of

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,810
the incidence photon and
the outgoing photon, respectively.

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,260
The conservation of energy-momentum
reduces the energy, omega prime,

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,300
of the outgoing photon compared
to that of the incident one, omega,

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,750
if the reaction occurs
on an electron at rest.

23
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,920
The reduction depends on the scattering
angle theta and the photon energy itself.

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,596
The figure gives an example
of this relationship for

25
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:09,589
a source of Am-241,
which emits photon with

26
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:14,865
omega = 59.54 keV.

27
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,515
Because of Heisenberg's principle,
we can in fact,

28
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:24,295
not know whether the photon in
the final state is emitted after or

29
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:28,305
before the absorption
of the incident photon.

30
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:31,455
So there are two configurations
of the Feynman diagram

31
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,815
which are indistinguishable.

32
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,826
The processes can
interfere with one another.

33
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:42,698
To calculate the cross section,
we must then add the amplitudes and

34
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:46,555
square the result,
as we explained in video 4.2.

35
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:50,299
For the differencial across cross-section,

36
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,740
one finds the so-called Klein-Nishina formula.

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,900
Two factors are of particular interest.

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,507
The first is the factor alpha squared,

39
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:05,540
which determines the order of
magnitude of the cross section.

40
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,705
It result from the fact that
each vertex introduces a factor of

41
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:15,735
e when constructing
the invariant amplitude M.

42
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:20,315
Consequently, the cross-section, which is
proportional to |M|^2,

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,910
which is proportional
to the fourth power of e,

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,400
is proportional to the square of
the fine structure constant alpha.

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,670
The second interesting factor involves
the product of two four vector

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,240
of photon polarization, epsilon and
epsilon prime.

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,050
These appear as the amplitude in
the wave function of the free photon,

48
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,590
which is the solution of
the homogeneous Maxwell equations.

49
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,173
Under the Lorenz gauge,
these equations of motion constrain

50
00:03:56,173 --> 00:04:00,510
epsilon such that k^2 = 0,

51
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,150
which is the condition for a real photon.

52
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,870
The gauge condition, ∂_µ A^µ = 0,

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,932
means that epsilon^µ k_µ = 0.

54
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:15,394
The four-vector of polarization
epsilon, indicating the electric field

55
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:20,460
direction, is thus orthogonal to the
four-momentum of the free photon k.

56
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,810
In addition,
this gauge condition shows that the photon

57
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,230
will function as only three
independent components, not four.

58
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,380
It is therefore justified to call
the photon a vector particle.

59
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,972
When the polarization of
the initial state is 0, and

60
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:46,128
that of the final state is not measured,
we must average the cross-section

61
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:52,450
over the direction of the initial spins,
and sum over those of the final state.

62
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,580
This must be done at the level of
the cross-sections, not of the amplitudes,

63
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,991
because the spin is an observable,

64
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:05,521
making the contributions distinguishable
as we discussed in video 4.2.

65
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,980
For the factor containing the polarization
this results in a distribution

66
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,965
(1 + cos^2 theta) of

67
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:21,114
the scattering angle theta between
the incoming and outgoing photons.

68
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:28,145
At high photon energy omega much larger
than m, the total cross-section

69
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:34,810
is roughly inversely proportional to
the square s of the total initial energy.

70
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,420
This is a property shared by all
scattering processes between point-like

71
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,021
particles.

72
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:44,559
Their cross-section decreases
with the square of the energy scale,

73
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,290
which characterizes the process.

74
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,310
Obviously, the square of the fine
structure constant alpha,

75
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,784
again determines the order of
magnitude of the cross section.

76
00:05:55,784 --> 00:06:00,514
Compton scattering can be measured at

77
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:05,096
high energies using the Large Electron-

78
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:09,676
Positron collider, LEP, at CERN,

79
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:15,168
which operated during the 80s and 90s.

80
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:20,483
The incident photon beam is generated by the incoming
electrons via the bremsstrahlung mechanism.

81
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:24,600
An accelerated charge 
tends to emit photons.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,050
Here the acceleration is caused by
the electromagnetic force coming from

83
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,066
the particles in the other beam.

84
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:36,640
The electron or positron emits a photon
in its original direction of motion.

85
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,522
The photon interacts with a positron or
electron

86
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,844
n the other beam,
via Compton scattering.

87
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:50,124
The outgoing electron and
photon are observed in

88
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:55,805
the detector. As the initial photon
connects two vertices it

89
00:06:55,805 --> 00:07:01,610
is a virtual photon with k^2
different from 0.

90
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,929
Our treatment of the Compton
effect applies to real

91
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,947
photons with a k^2 = 0.

92
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:12,394
To apply it to this case,
we select events for

93
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:17,115
which the mass of the initial
photon is negligible compared to

94
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:23,490
the characteristic energy, that is to
say k^2 << s.

95
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,664
The cross-section for
Compton scattering with this quasi real

96
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:32,720
photons measured by the experiment 
L3 at LEP is shown on the right.

97
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,652
The dependence on the initial
energy square root of s predicted

98
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:45,422
by the calculation is in fact
observed. It is proportional to 1/s.

99
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:50,620
Rotating the Compton scattering
Feynman diagram by 90 degrees,

100
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,660
one obtains another process.

101
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,070
The annihilation of an electron-
positron pair into a pair of photons.

102
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,424
Notice that we also convert
the outgoing electron of

103
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:08,525
the Compton process into
an incoming positron.

104
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:12,645
This remains without consequence
because these two states are completely

105
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,225
equivalent.

106
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,465
We will come back to that in
the beginning of module 6

107
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,535
when we discuss antiparticles
in more details.

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,013
With the appropriate changes
in the kinematic variables,

109
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:31,846
we can convert to the Compton scattering
result directly into the cross-section for

110
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:37,120
pair annihilation in the center of
mass frame and neglecting masses,

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,808
for s much larger than
the square of the electron mass.

112
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:45,519
Note again the characteristic factor,
alpha squared,

113
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,566
which comes from the coupling constants,
and 1/s,

114
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:54,729
which characterizes the square of
the energy available in the process.

115
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,108
We have chosen the center of mass
frame where the electron and

116
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:03,746
positron collide with equal and
opposite momenta.

117
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:07,975
The photons are therefore also emitted
with equal and opposite momenta.

118
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:10,036
The scattering angle theta

119
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:15,540
is the angle between the incoming
electron and the outgoing photons.

120
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,560
It is obvious that the angular
distribution is symmetric under

121
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,255
theta going to theta plus π.

122
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:29,960
The factor (1 - cos^2 theta) in
the denominator can come as a surprise,

123
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,590
because it makes the cross section diverge
when the scattering angle approaches 0 or

124
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,340
180 degrees.
Such divergence is not admissible.

125
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,180
The cross action that represent the
probability must always respect

126
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,037
the upper limit of unitarity corresponding
to a probability of 1 for the process.

127
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:55,290
Already the factor 1/s
looks suspicious, but

128
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,940
the dangerous limit, s -> 0, cannot
be reached because of the threshold 

129
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,230
s > 4 m_e^2.

130
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,590
The angular divergence on
the other hand is real.

131
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,996
It is finally not realized, because of
higher order corrections which cancel it.

132
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:22,211
In fact, the perturbative expansion
by orders of a small coupling constant,

133
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:26,447
always ends up converging
in a quantum field theory

134
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:30,930
based on the principles
of gauge invariance.

135
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,827
The demonstration of this fact has
been rewarded by Nobel Prize in 1999 for

136
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,140
t’Hooft and Veltman.

137
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,430
In fact, the cross section
is always really a finite quantity.

138
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,020
The figure shows the results of the
measurement by the L3 experiment at LEP.

139
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,022
The cross section follows with great
precision in absolute magnitude

140
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:59,114
and in energy dependence,
the prediction of quantum electrodynamics.

141
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:03,417
In the next video,
we give an example of an 

142
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,516
electromagnetic interaction
between four fermions,

143
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:13,263
e+ e- annihilation into
a fermion-antifermion pair.
