this fourth module, 
we going details 
properties 
electromagnetic interactions 
in this fourth video, we describe compton 
scattering, we already encountered 
in module we discussed 
interaction photons matter 
following this video, 
you will able to characterize 
compton scattering, 
is elastic scattering 
between a photon an electron 
describe polarization 
photon influences process, 
understand 
annihilation electron 
positron pairs photons 
similar properties 
we yet discussed that vector 
bosons, carry forces, also appear 
real particles, 
matter particles virtual ones 
compton scattering, elastic scattering 
between a photon an electron, 
involves a virtual intermediate electron, 
shown in this feynman diagram 
kinematics process is 
characterized energy omega 
incident photon 
scattering angle theta, 
angle between k k prime, 
fourmomenta 
incidence photon 
outgoing photon, respectively 
conservation energymomentum 
reduces energy, omega prime, 
outgoing photon compared 
to that incident one, omega, 
if reaction occurs 
an electron rest 
reduction depends scattering 
angle theta photon energy 
figure gives an example 
this relationship 
a source am, 
emits photon 
omega kev 
heisenbergs principle, 
we in fact, 
know whether photon in 
final state is emitted 
absorption 
incident photon 
so there two configurations 
feynman diagram 
indistinguishable 
processes 
interfere one another 
to calculate cross section, 
we must add amplitudes 
square result, 
we explained in video 
differencial across crosssection, 
one finds socalled kleinnishina formula 
two factors particular interest 
first is factor alpha squared, 
determines order 
magnitude cross section 
result fact that 
vertex introduces a factor 
e constructing 
invariant amplitude m 
consequently, crosssection, is 
proportional to m, 
is proportional 
to fourth power e, 
is proportional to square 
fine structure constant alpha 
second interesting factor involves 
product two four vector 
photon polarization, epsilon 
epsilon prime 
appear amplitude in 
wave function free photon, 
is solution 
homogeneous maxwell equations 
lorenz gauge, 
equations motion constrain 
epsilon that k , 
is condition a real photon 
gauge condition, a , 
means that epsilon k 
fourvector polarization 
epsilon, indicating electric field 
direction, is thus orthogonal to 
fourmomentum free photon k 
in addition, 
this gauge condition shows that photon 
will function three 
independent components, four 
is therefore justified to call 
photon a vector particle 
polarization 
initial state is , 
that final state is measured, 
we must average crosssection 
direction initial spins, 
sum final state 
this must done level 
crosssections, amplitudes, 
spin is an observable, 
making contributions distinguishable 
we discussed in video 
factor containing polarization 
this results in a distribution 
cos theta 
scattering angle theta between 
incoming outgoing photons 
high photon energy omega much larger 
m, total crosssection 
is roughly inversely proportional to 
square total initial energy 
this is a property shared 
scattering processes between pointlike 
particles 
crosssection decreases 
square energy scale, 
characterizes process 
obviously, square fine 
structure constant alpha, 
determines order 
magnitude cross section 
compton scattering measured 
high energies using large electron 
positron collider, lep, cern, 
operated 
incident photon beam is generated incoming 
electrons via bremsstrahlung mechanism 
an accelerated charge 
tends to emit photons 
here acceleration is caused 
electromagnetic force coming 
particles in beam 
electron positron emits a photon 
in original direction motion 
photon interacts a positron 
electron 
n beam, 
via compton scattering 
outgoing electron 
photon observed in 
detector initial photon 
connects two vertices 
is a virtual photon k 
different 
treatment compton 
effect applies to real 
photons a k 
to apply to this case, 
we select events 
mass initial 
photon is negligible compared to 
characteristic energy, that is to 
say k 
crosssection 
compton scattering this quasi real 
photons measured experiment 
l lep is shown right 
dependence initial 
energy square root predicted 
calculation is in fact 
observed is proportional to 
rotating compton scattering 
feynman diagram degrees, 
one obtains another process 
annihilation an electron 
positron pair a pair photons 
notice that we also convert 
outgoing electron 
compton process 
an incoming positron 
this remains without consequence 
two states completely 
equivalent 
we will come back to that in 
beginning module 
we discuss antiparticles 
in details 
appropriate changes 
in kinematic variables, 
we convert to compton scattering 
result directly crosssection 
pair annihilation in center 
mass frame neglecting masses, 
much larger 
square electron mass 
note characteristic factor, 
alpha squared, 
comes coupling constants, 
s, 
characterizes square 
energy available in process 
we chosen center mass 
frame electron 
positron collide equal 
opposite momenta 
photons therefore also emitted 
equal opposite momenta 
scattering angle theta 
is angle between incoming 
electron outgoing photons 
is obvious that angular 
distribution is symmetric 
theta going to theta plus 
factor cos theta in 
denominator come a surprise, 
makes cross section diverge 
scattering angle approaches 
degrees 
divergence is admissible 
cross action that represent 
probability must always respect 
upper limit unitarity corresponding 
to a probability process 
already factor 
looks suspicious, 
dangerous limit, , cannot 
reached threshold 

angular divergence 
hand is real 
is finally realized, 
higher order corrections cancel 
in fact, perturbative expansion 
orders a small coupling constant, 
always ends converging 
in a quantum field theory 
based principles 
gauge invariance 
demonstration this fact 
rewarded nobel prize in 
thooft veltman 
in fact, cross section 
is always really a finite quantity 
figure shows results 
measurement l experiment lep 
cross section follows great 
precision in absolute magnitude 
in energy dependence, 
prediction quantum electrodynamics 
in next video, 
we give an example an
