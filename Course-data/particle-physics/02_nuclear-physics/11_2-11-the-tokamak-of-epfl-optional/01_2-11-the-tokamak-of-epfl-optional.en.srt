1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:06,250
[MUSIC] In this second module 

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,810
of our introductory course in particle physics,

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,850
we are discussing the physics of the atomic nucleus. 

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,630
And in this eleventh video, 
we are fortunate to be invited to visit

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,600
the experimental Tokamak of the Federal 
Institute of Technology in Lausanne,

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,389
or more precisely of their Swiss Plasma Center.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,440
This is a research tool for nuclear fusion, 

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,080
which is the source, I remind you,

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,610
of energy produced in the sun, and other stars.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,420
If we ever manage to use fusion energy in 
commercial power plants,

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,590
mankind will have a virtually inexhaustible 
source of energy,

12
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,450
safe and environmentally friendly. 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,510
Fusion power plants impact the environment in fact very little

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,440
and produce no greenhouse gases.

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,950
One can also exclude any serious accident 
with large release of radioactivity 

16
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,401
because the fusion process does not by itself 

17
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:34,949
produce any radioactive waste from its fuel; only

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,960
the structural components inside the 
reactor become somewhat radioactive. 

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,000
Nuclear fusion has also the major advantage of using 

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,690
fuels that are available on Earth,

21
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,690
in virtually inexhaustible quantities.

22
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:58,130
It could thus become one pillar 
of our energy supply

23
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,860
that will provide the necessary conditions 
for sustainable development.

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,200
I remind you that the fusion reaction 
between deuterium and tritium 

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,810
has already been introduced in video 2.10.

26
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,890
It produces a strongly bound helium nucleus

27
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,645
and a neutron, releasing a large amount of energy,

28
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:26,250
approximately 17.5 MeV per reaction

29
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,360
So today we will visit a medium sized reactor, 

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,870
which is behind me, called the TCV, 

31
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,059
Tokamak with Variable Configuration, 
of the Swiss Plasma Center.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,540
In such an instrument the issues 
of containment and stability 

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,430
of the plasma are studied, which are 
necessary for the realisation of a fusion reactor.

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,030
To realise an efficient fusion reaction, and to study

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,670
burning plasma which produces energy, 
will require larger machines

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,355
like ITER, which we will discuss 
at the end of this video.

37
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:09,890
[NOISE] So we are now in the lobby 
of the Swiss Plasma Center,

38
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,730
and I present to you my two 
colleagues from EPFL,

39
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,370
who will be our guides during the visit. 

40
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,770
Here on my left is Dr. Yves Martin, 
who is the Administrative Director,

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,540
and also the person responsible for 
communication of the Swiss Plasma Center; 

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,475
and on my right is Dr. Antoine Pochelon, 
who is senior lecturer, 

43
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:35,990
admittedly in retirement, but who has lost none

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,530
of his enthusiasm for plasma physics and nuclear fusion.

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,720
Our subject today is nuclear fusion, 
and how to put it to use

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,590
in the transformation of nuclear 
energy into usable energy.

47
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,970
So what does this have to do with plasmas, Yves?

48
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,270
>> In fact, the fusion reaction we seek to produce 

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,890
in a Tokamak can be obtained only at very high

50
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,418
temperatures, because one must overcome 
the Coulomb repulsion.

51
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:12,170
And to overcome this Coulomb repulsion, 
it is necessary to heat

52
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,840
to temperatures at which matter takes 
the form of a plasma.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,650
A plasma is a gas in which the atoms are ionised, 

54
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,060
in which the electrons are dissociated 

55
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,570
from the nucleus of their atom

56
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,700
And from that point onwards, 
we have a mixture of charged particles,

57
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,870
but globally neutral.

58
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,750
>> Okay.
>> And the benefit of this state 

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,460
of matter is that we can guide the 
particles using a magnetic field.

60
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,880
>> Ok.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,370
So therefore there are several steps. 

62
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,610
First one must create a plasma, 
confine it, magnetically I imagine,

63
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,350
and heat it to relatively high temperatures, 
indeed, incredible temperatures. 

64
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,400
So can you describe a bit these steps?

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,190
>> The beginning of plasma formation?

66
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,960
>> Yes.
>> Well,

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,970
it actually begins with a gas 

68
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,560
in which an electric field is applied.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,690
And this electrical field short-circuits the plasma

70
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,579
it causes in fact a discharge in a rarefied gas.

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,580
And then, the electric field draws a 
current, this current heats the plasma,

72
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,180
heats the gas which is becoming a plasma 
when it reaches a temperature,

73
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,380
typically of 10’000 degrees Kelvin,

74
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,380
corresponding to a kinetic energy of 

75
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,889
typically one eV.

76
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,620
>> That is to say, to the binding energy 
between a typical electron and a typical nucleus.

77
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,050
>> It's the order of magnitude, effectively

78
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,700
to separate the electron

79
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,570
from its nucleus. 

80
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,820
We are producing this discharge

81
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,270
in a magnetic field, which guides

82
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,730
the particles, and forms a magnetic bottle.

83
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,820
And we have behind us an example of 
such a bottle, called a Tokamak.

84
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,720
>> Yes, is it a model of one-to-one scale?

85
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,770
>> It's a 1:1 model of the machine

86
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,710
that you'll see in a moment, and

87
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,830
different colours allow us to see the 
many different elements.

88
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,940
First one starts, on the inside, 
by the vacuum chamber, 

89
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,280
wherein the plasma will be installed.

90
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,160
The main magnetic field of the magnetic 
bottle is generated by the blue coils, 

91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,510
toroidal coils, which create a field 
around the center in a toroidal sense.

92
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,780
>> A field that revolves around the machine's center.

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,939
>> That's right, here we have a 
transverse section of the machine.

94
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,740
And then, to generate the electric field, 
which we spoke about,

95
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,580
we have these coils, which form the 
primary circuit of a power transformer,

96
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,780
which induces an electric field, 
and thus the plasma current. 

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,330
In addition, it is a special feature 
of this machine,

98
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,550
that we have as many as 16 additional 
coils, in yellow here…

99
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,920
>> The yellow ones, yes.

100
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,510
>> …powered by independent generators.

101
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,890
…powered by independent generators.

102
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,520
This allows controlling the 
plasma shape and position.

103
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,440
It also helps to extend the plasma, 
since ultimately

104
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,629
currents of the same sign repel each other, 

105
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,930
opposite currents attract each other.

106
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,400
>> To simplify somewhat, the blue coils 
create a field that is confining, 

107
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,818
and then the yellow coils are used to 
manipulate the shape of the containment.

108
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:03,600
So, Yves, can explain how, then, 

109
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,040
the plasma is heated beyond the initial temperature?

110
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,170
So first of all, as in any Tokamak, 

111
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,120
ohmic heating is used; simply,

112
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,790
as Antoine has said, there is current flowing in the plasma.

113
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,515
>> Okay.

114
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,875
So it is the plasma resistance that will heat the plasma. 

115
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,925
>> Absolutely.

116
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,985
But the temperature, which can be 
achieved with this heating, is not 

117
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,015
sufficient yet.

118
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,105
So we must add other heating systems,

119
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:33,635
and what we normally use, 
notably here in our Tokamak,

120
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:38,110
is heating by microwaves or radiofrequency heating.

121
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,680
It will act on resonances to be found in the plasma.

122
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,420
>> But,

123
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,200
this will heat the electrons, right? 

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,690
And not nuclei, 

125
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,490
primarily…

126
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,370
>> Indeed, the heating system we have here 

127
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,000
primarily heats the electrons; but 
afterwards, by collision with the ions,

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,630
the electron energy is also transferred to 

129
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,580
the ions, and therefore, the temperature 
of the ions also increases.

130
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,580
>> So, to learn how one generates the radiofrequencies, 

131
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,110
which heat the plasma, we will go up, 
to see gyrotrons 

132
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,074
producing this radiofrequency.

133
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,932
[NOISE]
>> I'll go through what a gyrotron is:

134
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,990
you have one installed down there, 

135
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,980
we'll get back to that in a moment.

136
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,380
The gyrotron is essentially a vacuum tube

137
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,519
that generates 0.5 to 1 mega-watt

138
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,360
of power.

139
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,390
At the bottom of the image, you 
find the electron gun

140
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,800
producing an electron beam, which 
passes through the tube.

141
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,940
The electrons arrive in the collector, 
here, at the bottom right. 

142
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,370
Then, the electron beam passes

143
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,120
through a cavity within the magnetic 
field generated by a superconductor.

144
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,768
Then using a wave converter,

145
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:16,590
the microwave power is directed onto a 
mirror and laterally removed from the tube.

146
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,100
Here we see such a gyrotron:

147
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,370
Invisible below, the electron gun, 
in the middle the cylinder

148
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,050
housing the superconducting magnet 
with the cavity.

149
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,880
On top, under its yellow lead cover, 
you have the electron collector.

150
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,060
In front, the microwave enters the optical adapter box

151
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,470
with various mirrors that elliptically 

152
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,510
polarise the wave, in the right way

153
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,090
to heat the plasma locally in the Tokamak.

154
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,260
We use, as you see here, a whole battery of gyrotrons.

155
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,540
We have six at a frequency of 80 GHz,  
with a total power of  3 MW. 

156
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,350
And back here we have 

157
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,450
gyrotrons of 120 GHz, which are very 
long pulse gyrotrons

158
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,065
we manufactured in collaboration 
with French colleagues.

159
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:25,770
[MUSIC]
>> So here is the TCV Tokamak 

160
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,820
with first the magnetic coils 
that will create the main field, 

161
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,200
the toroidal field, and a little bit on the back

162
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,030
coils that will help shape the plasma, the eight coils.

163
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,050
So we see only the outer coils,

164
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,780
all the others are hidden inside the machine.

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,140
And right there behind, 

166
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,240
one sees the vacuum chamber into 
which we will inject our plasma. 

167
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,070
To heat the plasma, we use microwaves to take 

168
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,500
the plasma to very, very high temperatures. 

169
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,820
The temperatures required for fusion 
are of the order of 

170
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,990
100 to 150 million degrees, and in this Tokamak,

171
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,910
we obtained such temperatures.

172
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,035
Note that in the sun, temperatures are much lower,

173
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:18,945
around 1.5 keV, and at this temperature, in fact,

174
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:22,255
only the particles found in the tail 
of the Maxwell distribution will merge.

175
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:28,665
>> The inside of the TCV vacuum chamber is 
covered with carbon tiles, in fact, 

176
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,035
like a space shuttle. 

177
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,290
And the tile surface is covered with boron carbide

178
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,700
by plasma deposition, almost as hard 
as a diamond layer, which reduces 

179
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:49,050
on one hand, the plasma abrasion 
of the carbon tiles.

180
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:56,030
Moreover, as B4C is formed by elements 
with low charge Z,

181
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,080
it makes that the plasma sees only low Z.

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,160
This is very important because a source of 

183
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,360
plasma energy loss is radiation.

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,980
And this radiation increases 
sharply with the electric charge,

185
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,945
typically as Z to the 4th power.

186
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:18,220
[MUSIC] The role of the TCV 

187
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,735
we have behind us is to study 
the properties of the plasma. 

188
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,870
That is to say for example the density, 

189
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,110
temperature, or even the rotation of the plasma, 
because the plasma rotates in the vacuum chamber.

190
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,450
With that, we will be able to study the confinement, 

191
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,150
the transport of heat and the stability.

192
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,760
And this, we will study as a function of different characteristics,

193
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,750
such as density, temperature and rotation. 

194
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,000
One thing we will particularly examine 
with the TCV, this machine

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,690
where you can vary the shape of the plasma, 
is the dependence on the form. 

196
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,740
One can also create a divertor. 

197
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,920
A divertor is basically a magnetic 
structure outside the plasma 

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,900
that removes impurities, which are, 

199
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,050
in the case of fusion, helium, 
which is the product of the reaction. 

200
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,610
So we will eliminate it, and also remove 
impurities at high Z, which

201
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,529
as we have seen, make the plasma radiate. 

202
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,040
Therefore, around the machine, we have an amount of 

203
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,710
diagnostics, measurements such as this neutral injector 

204
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,940
measuring the ion temperature and plasma rotation. 

205
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,385
But we also have tools, 

206
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:59,030
i.e. actuators to vary the plasma parameters.

207
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,530
We have already spoken about the 
microwave heating 

208
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,350
which primarily heats the electrons. 

209
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,710
We are also installing now 
1 megawatt heating 

210
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,780
by neutral injection to heat directly the ions.

211
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,360
So this makes a total of 4.5 megawatts 
for gyrotrons at frequencies between 80

212
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,005
and 120 GHz, and then to begin with 
1 megawatt of neutral injection.

213
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,930
[MUSIC]
>> So all this means that the TCV 

214
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,840
is a research tool rather than a 
prototype reactor, right?

215
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,020
But I guess it is part of a more 
comprehensive program 

216
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,910
that should lead to a fusion reactor, 
a true one, right?

217
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,280
>> Absolutely, the Tokamak here is an 
experimental Tokamak, 

218
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,930
which is used in a vast fusion research program. 

219
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,980
It is clear that to meet the many 
challenges of fusion, 

220
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,930
i.e. to arrive at a commercial fusion reactor, 

221
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,960
it is necessary to coordinate our efforts 
at the European level,

222
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,370
at the international level, and 
Switzerland is part since 1978, 

223
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,420
through a bilateral agreement between 
Switzerland and Euratom, in all European programs.

224
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,160
>> What is the role of the TCV in such a program? 

225
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,009
Antoine, what are the specifics of the TCV that can 

226
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,110
contribute to this program?

227
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,800
>> The most important specificity of TCV 

228
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,060
is that it allows varying the shape of the plasma.

229
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,070
And this is a program that we are heavily exploiting. 

230
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,620
For example, most large Tokamaks today have a

231
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:47,460
D-shaped plasma, that is to say the plasma 
belly looks towards the outside.

232
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:53,110
But in TCV, one can also make plasmas 

233
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,390
in the shape of an inverted D, that is to 
say the belly looks inward.

234
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,500
And it is, in fact, 

235
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,850
the only machine in the world to make this type of plasmas.

236
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,510
>> And what is the point of having this form of plasma?

237
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,190
>> We were lucky to have as a bonus 

238
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,350
a rather surprising result, 
it was not expected of all at first, 

239
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,378
which is to have the energy confinement 

240
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:25,600
increased by a factor of two with the inverted D.

241
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,900
This is first interesting in itself.

242
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,810
Then, when you have a doubled confinement,

243
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,790
you can put half the heat into the plasma,

244
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,580
so you pay less to heat the plasma 
to the same temperature.

245
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,890
So that's a first advantage.
The second advantage is 

246
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,900
that it allows having plasmas of equivalent temperature,

247
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,140
but with completely different shapes.
And who says different confinement,

248
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,730
also says different turbulence.

249
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,970
So we can compare now with complex codes, 

250
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,820
which simulate the plasma turbulence 
and its confinement, 

251
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,380
and we can compare in this way the experiment with

252
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,380
numerical models and this is really 
what the experiment is good for.

253
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,380
>> So it is the turbulent plasma 
instabilities that limit confinement,

254
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,210
confinement time in a Tokamak?

255
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,500
>> Actually, at the plasma edge we observe instabilities 

256
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,180
that strangely resemble the solar 
prominences, solar flares.

257
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,080
We see in this video, which comes from 
Tokamak MAST in England, 

258
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
these flashes of light, which resemble solar flares. 

259
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,170
And we develop operational modes precisely to reduce

260
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,275
the impact that these solar flares 
would have on the Tokamak material.

261
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:57,410
[MUSIC] This Tokamak with its shape control system, 

262
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,535
the electron heating system, 
and soon its ion heating system,

263
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,005
as well as with its set of diagnostic tools,

264
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:09,725
measuring devices, it is an 
exceedingly productive machine. 

265
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:13,795
We obtain large quantities of absolutely 
fantastic results, which can be created 

266
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,935
with this machine that is absolutely 
unique worldwide.

267
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:20,850
Moreover, the fact that we are part of an academic environment 

268
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,250
in the context of EPFL, gives the possibility to 
educate a lot of doctoral students

269
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,105
in plasmas physics tasks.

270
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:28,940
[MUSIC]
>> So the next step 

271
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,950
towards commercial use of fusion is called ITER. 

272
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,970
A true reactor this time?

273
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,120
>> Yes, absolutely, it is the first reactor, 

274
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,530
it is likely the first time that we will 
produce much more energy 

275
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,890
than what the machine requires to function.

276
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,330
They talk about a factor of ten 
of energy amplification.

277
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,510
Here is a model, 

278
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,110
of a much smaller scale than the model we saw before.

279
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,690
So the scale here is 1:50, 

280
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,270
you see a little man here behind. 

281
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,780
Otherwise it has exactly the same 
components that we have in our Tokamak.

282
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,850
>> So it is an international program, I imagine,

283
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,500
it is not only Switzerland who builds it?

284
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,340
>> Absolutely.

285
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,835
It is a global collaboration with Japan, 
South Korea, China, 

286
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:27,065
India, Russia, the United States and 
Europe, including Switzerland.

287
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:32,985
>> So what is the role of Switzerland 
in promoting this project?

288
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:36,800
>> We contribute first of all scientific 
aspects: the operation

289
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,140
is prepared for this machine, 

290
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,350
the scientific program, 

291
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,110
to know which experiments we
will perform with it.

292
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,820
But we are also preparing physical elements,

293
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,070
notably the microwave mirror systems, which allow

294
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,160
injecting the microwave, for which 
we are experts here at the Swiss Plasma Center,

295
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,540
with all the knowledge we have accumulated over the years.

296
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,300
We also participate in magnetic measurements, and also

297
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,950
in the superconductor tests; 
all superconductors to be used 

298
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,210
for all the coils of the machine will 
pass through Switzerland,

299
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,970
through our laboratory to be tested.

300
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,570
>> So, in contrast to the TCV, 
it will not be normal magnets, 

301
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,990
but superconducting magnets that will serve here.

302
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,620
>> Absolutely.
>> So,

303
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,120
up to a large size increase, all this 
follows somewhat the same principles, 

304
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,810
that of the Tokamak, right?

305
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,990
But are that there are no other means to store a plasma 

306
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,590
that can undergo fusion?

307
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,700
>> In magnetic confinement, 

308
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,400
there are essentially two major strategies.

309
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
We talked about the Tokamak, and I will 
quickly repeat what a Tokamak is.

310
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,030
In a Tokamak, the confining field is made at same time

311
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,530
outside the plasma by the toroidal coils,

312
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,800
and within the plasma, by the field created 
by the current circulating in the plasma.

313
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,430
There is another way of making magnetic bottles, 

314
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,390
the Stellarator.

315
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,370
In that concept, the field, which confines the plasma, 

316
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:18,160
is generated completely on the outside,

317
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,140
by coils with rather complex shapes. 
That is why there are not so many

318
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,220
Stellarators worldwide right now, 
they are difficult to build.

319
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,440
The stellarator is promising also

320
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,825
because there is no disruption like in a Tokamak, 

321
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,140
that is to say brutal interruptions of the plasma current,

322
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,090
and you can get to very high densities. 

323
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,550
It is therefore extremely promising 
from the plasma point of view,

324
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,110
but it is difficult to build.

325
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,550
>> But there is a Stellarator, 
which was built in Germany.

326
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,960
>> Yes, in Greifswald on the shores 
of the Baltic sea, 

327
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,000
the Stellarator Wendelstein 7-X was built

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,160
in recent years and, right now, they are 
currently testing the shape of the magnetic field

329
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,410
produced by the very complex coils outside the machine.

330
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,850
There you have a very elegant picture, 
which shows that

331
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,150
the magnetic field, which they had wanted 
to achieve, is indeed realised.

332
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,530
>> And according to you, these two strategic 
directions will they result in a reactor

333
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,320
that works and produces energy soon?

334
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,120
>> We explore the Tokamak, 

335
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,770
which is relatively simple to build, 
and the Stellarator,

336
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,560
which is an alternative.

337
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,500
In fact, fusion is a program 
that spans many generations.

338
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,330
It's long, it's a program that 
includes both fundamental research

339
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:54,760
and also an extremely applied research: 
we must develop

340
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,720
the materials necessary for fusion, 
we need very large superconductors 

341
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,140
at high fields, then we must, 
to name just one example, 

342
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,550
regenerate tritium from lithium irradiation.

343
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,810
Thus, a vast program.

344
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,655
>> Thank you very much, Yves and Antoine, 
for this visit and for this fascinating journey 

345
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:21,950
through the world of fusion 

346
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,870
and plasma physics. 

347
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:29,250
I draw your attention to a MOOC offered by EPFL

348
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,570
in parallel to this course, 
entitled "Plasma Physics and Applications",

349
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:41,025
you will find information on the web site shown here.
