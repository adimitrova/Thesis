music in this second module 
introductory course in particle physics, 
we discussing physics atomic nucleus 
in this eleventh video, 
we fortunate to invited to visit 
experimental tokamak federal 
institute technology in lausanne, 
precisely swiss plasma center 
this is a research tool nuclear fusion, 
is source, i remind you, 
energy produced in sun, stars 
if we ever manage to use fusion energy in 
commercial power plants, 
mankind will a virtually inexhaustible 
source energy, 
safe environmentally friendly 
fusion power plants impact environment in fact little 
produce greenhouse gases 
one also exclude serious accident 
large release radioactivity 
fusion process 
produce radioactive waste fuel 
structural components inside 
reactor become somewhat radioactive 
nuclear fusion also major advantage using 
fuels that available earth, 
in virtually inexhaustible quantities 
could thus become one pillar 
energy supply 
that will provide necessary conditions 
sustainable development 
i remind you that fusion reaction 
between deuterium tritium 
already introduced in video 
produces a strongly bound helium nucleus 
a neutron, releasing a large amount energy, 
approximately mev per reaction 
so today we will visit a medium sized reactor, 
is behind me, called tcv, 
tokamak variable configuration, 
swiss plasma center 
in an instrument issues 
containment stability 
plasma studied, 
necessary realisation a fusion reactor 
to realise an efficient fusion reaction, to study 
burning plasma produces energy, 
will require larger machines 
like iter, we will discuss 
end this video 
noise so we in lobby 
swiss plasma center, 
i present to you two 
colleagues epfl, 
will guides visit 
here left is dr yves martin, 
is administrative director, 
also person responsible 
communication swiss plasma center 
right is dr antoine pochelon, 
is senior lecturer, 
admittedly in retirement, lost none 
enthusiasm plasma physics nuclear fusion 
subject today is nuclear fusion, 
to put to use 
in transformation nuclear 
energy usable energy 
so this to plasmas, yves 
in fact, fusion reaction we seek to produce 
in a tokamak obtained high 
temperatures, one must overcome 
coulomb repulsion 
to overcome this coulomb repulsion, 
is necessary to heat 
to temperatures matter takes 
form a plasma 
a plasma is a gas in atoms ionised, 
in electrons dissociated 
nucleus atom 
that point onwards, 
we a mixture charged particles, 
globally neutral 
okay 
benefit this state 
matter is that we guide 
particles using a magnetic field 
ok 
so therefore there several steps 
first one must create a plasma, 
confine it, magnetically i imagine, 
heat to relatively high temperatures, 
indeed, incredible temperatures 
so you describe a bit steps 
beginning plasma formation 
yes 
well, 
actually begins a gas 
in an electric field is applied 
this electrical field shortcircuits plasma 
causes in fact a discharge in a rarefied gas 
then, electric field draws a 
current, this current heats plasma, 
heats gas is becoming a plasma 
reaches a temperature, 
typically degrees kelvin, 
corresponding to a kinetic energy 
typically one ev 
that is to say, to binding energy 
between a typical electron a typical nucleus 
order magnitude, effectively 
to separate electron 
nucleus 
we producing this discharge 
in a magnetic field, guides 
particles, forms a magnetic bottle 
we behind us an example 
a bottle, called a tokamak 
yes, is a model onetoone scale 
a model machine 
that youll see in a moment, 
different colours allow us to see 
many different elements 
first one starts, inside, 
vacuum chamber, 
wherein plasma will installed 
main magnetic field magnetic 
bottle is generated blue coils, 
toroidal coils, create a field 
around center in a toroidal sense 
a field that revolves around machines center 
thats right, here we a 
transverse section machine 
then, to generate electric field, 
we spoke about, 
we coils, form 
primary circuit a power transformer, 
induces an electric field, 
thus plasma current 
in addition, is a special feature 
this machine, 
that we many additional 
coils, in yellow here 
yellow ones, yes 
powered independent generators 
powered independent generators 
this allows controlling 
plasma shape position 
also helps to extend plasma, 
since ultimately 
currents sign repel other, 
opposite currents attract 
to simplify somewhat, blue coils 
create a field that is confining, 
yellow coils used to 
manipulate shape containment 
so, yves, explain how, then, 
plasma is heated beyond initial temperature 
so first all, in tokamak, 
ohmic heating is used simply, 
antoine said, there is current flowing in plasma 
okay 
so is plasma resistance that will heat plasma 
absolutely 
temperature, 
achieved this heating, is 
sufficient yet 
so we must add heating systems, 
we normally use, 
notably here in tokamak, 
is heating microwaves radiofrequency heating 
will act resonances to found in plasma 
but, 
this will heat electrons, right 
nuclei, 
primarily 
indeed, heating system we here 
primarily heats electrons 
afterwards, collision ions, 
electron energy is also transferred to 
ions, therefore, temperature 
ions also increases 
so, to learn one generates radiofrequencies, 
heat plasma, we will go up, 
to see gyrotrons 
producing this radiofrequency 
noise 
ill go a gyrotron is 
you one installed there, 
well get back to that in a moment 
gyrotron is essentially a vacuum tube 
that generates to megawatt 
power 
bottom image, you 
find electron gun 
producing an electron beam, 
passes tube 
electrons arrive in collector, 
here, bottom right 
then, electron beam passes 
a cavity within magnetic 
field generated a superconductor 
using a wave converter, 
microwave power is directed onto a 
mirror laterally removed tube 
here we see a gyrotron 
invisible below, electron gun, 
in middle cylinder 
housing superconducting magnet 
cavity 
top, yellow lead cover, 
you electron collector 
in front, microwave enters optical adapter box 
various mirrors that elliptically 
polarise wave, in right way 
to heat plasma locally in tokamak 
we use, you see here, a whole battery gyrotrons 
we six a frequency ghz, 
a total power mw 
back here we 
gyrotrons ghz, 
long pulse gyrotrons 
we manufactured in collaboration 
french colleagues 
music 
so here is tcv tokamak 
first magnetic coils 
that will create main field, 
toroidal field, a little bit back 
coils that will help shape plasma, eight coils 
so we see outer coils, 
others hidden inside machine 
right there behind, 
one sees vacuum chamber 
we will inject plasma 
to heat plasma, we use microwaves to take 
plasma to very, high temperatures 
temperatures required fusion 
order 
to million degrees, in this tokamak, 
we obtained temperatures 
note that in sun, temperatures much lower, 
around kev, this temperature, in fact, 
particles found in tail 
maxwell distribution will merge 
inside tcv vacuum chamber is 
covered carbon tiles, in fact, 
like a space shuttle 
tile surface is covered boron carbide 
plasma deposition, almost hard 
a diamond layer, reduces 
one hand, plasma abrasion 
carbon tiles 
moreover, bc is formed elements 
low charge z, 
makes that plasma sees low z 
this is important a source 
plasma energy loss is radiation 
this radiation increases 
sharply electric charge, 
typically z to th power 
music role tcv 
we behind us is to study 
properties plasma 
that is to say example density, 
temperature, even rotation plasma, 
plasma rotates in vacuum chamber 
that, we will able to study confinement, 
transport heat stability 
this, we will study a function different characteristics, 
density, temperature rotation 
one thing we will particularly examine 
tcv, this machine 
you vary shape plasma, 
is dependence form 
one also create a divertor 
a divertor is basically a magnetic 
structure outside plasma 
that removes impurities, are, 
in case fusion, helium, 
is product reaction 
so we will eliminate it, also remove 
impurities high z, 
we seen, make plasma radiate 
therefore, around machine, we an amount 
diagnostics, measurements this neutral injector 
measuring ion temperature plasma rotation 
we also tools, 
ie actuators to vary plasma parameters 
we already spoken 
microwave heating 
primarily heats electrons 
we also installing 
megawatt heating 
neutral injection to heat directly ions 
so this makes a total megawatts 
gyrotrons frequencies between 
ghz, to begin 
megawatt neutral injection 
music 
so this means that tcv 
is a research tool rather a 
prototype reactor, right 
i guess is part a 
comprehensive program 
that lead to a fusion reactor, 
a true one, right 
absolutely, tokamak here is an 
experimental tokamak, 
is used in a vast fusion research program 
is clear that to meet many 
challenges fusion, 
ie to arrive a commercial fusion reactor, 
is necessary to coordinate efforts 
european level, 
international level, 
switzerland is part since , 
a bilateral agreement between 
switzerland euratom, in european programs 
is role tcv in a program 
antoine, specifics tcv that 
contribute to this program 
important specificity tcv 
is that allows varying shape plasma 
this is a program that we heavily exploiting 
example, large tokamaks today a 
dshaped plasma, that is to say plasma 
belly looks towards outside 
in tcv, one also make plasmas 
in shape an inverted d, that is to 
say belly looks inward 
is, in fact, 
machine in world to make this type plasmas 
is point this form plasma 
we lucky to a bonus 
a rather surprising result, 
expected first, 
is to energy confinement 
increased a factor two inverted d 
this is first interesting in 
then, you a doubled confinement, 
you put half heat plasma, 
so you pay less to heat plasma 
to temperature 
so thats a first advantage 
second advantage is 
that allows plasmas equivalent temperature, 
completely different shapes 
says different confinement, 
also says different turbulence 
so we compare complex codes, 
simulate plasma turbulence 
confinement, 
we compare in this way experiment 
numerical models this is really 
experiment is good 
so is turbulent plasma 
instabilities that limit confinement, 
confinement time in a tokamak 
actually, plasma edge we observe instabilities 
that strangely resemble solar 
prominences, solar flares 
we see in this video, comes 
tokamak mast in england, 
flashes light, resemble solar flares 
we develop operational modes precisely to reduce 
impact that solar flares 
would tokamak material 
music this tokamak shape control system, 
electron heating system, 
soon ion heating system, 
well set diagnostic tools, 
measuring devices, is an 
exceedingly productive machine 
we obtain large quantities absolutely 
fantastic results, created 
this machine that is absolutely 
unique worldwide 
moreover, fact that we part an academic environment 
in context epfl, gives possibility to 
educate a lot doctoral students 
in plasmas physics tasks 
music 
so next step 
towards commercial use fusion is called iter 
a true reactor this time 
yes, absolutely, is first reactor, 
is likely first time that we will 
produce much energy 
machine requires to function 
talk a factor ten 
energy amplification 
here is a model, 
a much smaller scale model we saw 
so scale here is , 
you see a little man here behind 
otherwise exactly 
components that we in tokamak 
so is an international program, i imagine, 
is switzerland builds 
absolutely 
is a global collaboration japan, 
south korea, china, 
india, russia, united states 
europe, including switzerland 
so is role switzerland 
in promoting this project 
we contribute first scientific 
aspects operation 
is prepared this machine, 
scientific program, 
to know experiments we 
will perform 
we also preparing physical elements, 
notably microwave mirror systems, allow 
injecting microwave, 
we experts here swiss plasma center, 
knowledge we accumulated years 
we also participate in magnetic measurements, also 
in superconductor tests 
superconductors to used 
coils machine will 
pass switzerland, 
laboratory to tested 
so, in contrast to tcv, 
will normal magnets, 
superconducting magnets that will serve here 
absolutely 
so, 
to a large size increase, this 
follows somewhat principles, 
that tokamak, right 
that there means to store a plasma 
that undergo fusion 
in magnetic confinement, 
there essentially two major strategies 
we talked tokamak, i will 
quickly repeat a tokamak is 
in a tokamak, confining field is made time 
outside plasma toroidal coils, 
within plasma, field created 
current circulating in plasma 
there is another way making magnetic bottles, 
stellarator 
in that concept, field, confines plasma, 
is generated completely outside, 
coils rather complex shapes 
that is there so many 
stellarators worldwide right now, 
difficult to build 
stellarator is promising also 
there is disruption like in a tokamak, 
that is to say brutal interruptions plasma current, 
you get to high densities 
is therefore extremely promising 
plasma point view, 
is difficult to build 
there is a stellarator, 
built in germany 
yes, in greifswald shores 
baltic sea, 
stellarator wendelstein x built 
in recent years and, right now, 
currently testing shape magnetic field 
produced complex coils outside machine 
there you a elegant picture, 
shows that 
magnetic field, wanted 
to achieve, is indeed realised 
according to you, two strategic 
directions will result in a reactor 
that works produces energy soon 
we explore tokamak, 
is relatively simple to build, 
stellarator, 
is an alternative 
in fact, fusion is a program 
that spans many generations 
long, a program that 
includes fundamental research 
also an extremely applied research 
we must develop 
materials necessary fusion, 
we need large superconductors 
high fields, we must, 
to name one example, 
regenerate tritium lithium irradiation 
thus, a vast program 
thank you much, yves antoine,
