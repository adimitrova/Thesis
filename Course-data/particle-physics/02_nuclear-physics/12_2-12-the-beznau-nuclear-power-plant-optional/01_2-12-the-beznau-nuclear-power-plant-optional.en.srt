00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,910
[MUSIC] >> During this second module, 

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,150
we are discussing the physics of the atomic nucleus.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,980
In video 2.8, the physical principles of nuclear fission were discussed

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,755
and in video 2.9, it was explained 

5
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:32,246
how these principles are implemented to build a nuclear reactor. 

6
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:37,325
Today, we visit the Beznau nuclear power plant, which has been 

7
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:42,334
in production since 1969, making it the oldest nuclear power plant 

8
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:47,820
that is still being commercially exploited.

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,626
The power plant welcomes us in its showroom

10
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:57,140
called the Axporama, which you see around me. 

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,590
After watching this video, you will know how to do three things.

12
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,296
The first is to describe the operation of a

13
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:10,760
pressurized water nuclear power plant such as Beznau.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,850
The second is to describe the regulation mechanisms 

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,947
of the chain reaction and the

16
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:28,370
security mechanisms that monitor the safety of this process.

17
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,521
And the third, appreciate the role of nuclear energy

18
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:40,000
in the mix of energy production in Switzerland,

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,390
in Europe and in the world.

20
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:54,090
Today we are invited to the Beznau nuclear power station, which belongs to Axpo SA.

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,870
We are in the Axporama exhibition, which is part of the plant,

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:08,770
and which informs about 15'000 visitors each year about energy in general and about nuclear energy and its production by nuclear fission in particular.

23
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:18,670
Our host today is Dr. Urs Weidmann. 

24
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,490
He is a particle physicist like me. 

25
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,310
He is a graduate of the University of Zürich with an experimental work on the violation of muon number, 

26
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:37,440
still a topical field of research, which is still pursued at the Paul Scherrer Institute not far from here.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,570
He obtained his PhD at the University of Bern, about the influence of CO2 emissions on the climate,

28
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:53,130
still a topic of high interest 30 years after his PhD. In particular, he made a model of ocean currents

29
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,490
and their influence on the adsorption of CO2 by seawater, and the delay this causes on the climate effect.

30
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:05,475
The use of nuclear power produces virtually no CO2, 

31
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:13,460
so it seems logical that after his doctorate he moved to the Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear Security ENSI.

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,630
From there he changed to NAGRA, the Swiss competence center for the storage of radioactive waste.

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,785
And after 3 years to a nuclear power producer, that is to say the Beznau nuclear power plant, first in the monitoring department, 

34
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:32,940
then in the electrotechnical department and finally for 8 years as director of the power plant.

35
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,135
Thank you very much, Dr. Weidmann, that you are available this course with your broad background of knowledge. 

36
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:45,330
Could you briefly introduce us to Axpo company?

37
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,720
>> Axpo is a Swiss power company owned by the cantons of northeastern Switzerland. 

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:02,710
The group produces, sells and distributes energy for more than 3 million people and several thousand companies in Switzerland.

39
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,395
It is the leader in the production of electricity of hydraulic and nuclear origin, as well as of renewable energy sources, in particular wind power.

40
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:17,720
Axpo is active in more than 30 countries. It employs around 4,500 people, including 4,250 in Switzerland.

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,735
>> So a major company.

42
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:31,750
Could you briefly introduce us to the Beznau nuclear power plant, the KKB, of which you are the director.

43
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,930
>> The KKB consists of two identical pressurized water reactors from Westinghouse.

44
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,780
The two blocks have a net electrical power of 365 MW each.

45
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,270
The production of these two blocks covers about 10% of the Swiss electricity consumption.

46
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:03,135
The Beznau nuclear power plant complies with the most modern safety requirements.

47
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:08,440
This high standard of security has been maintained by constant updates and renewal investments of more than 2.5 billion Swiss francs.

48
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,150
In this way it is assured that the KKB, during its operation of more than 45 years, has always fulfilled the current requirements in safety,

49
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,650
in several aspects it even surpassed them.

50
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,150
The Swiss supervisory authority, IFSN, confirmed this fact on several occasions.

51
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:31,500
Axpo plans to operate its nuclear power plants as long as they are safe and economically viable.

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:39,030
>> We are interested in this course less by the economic aspect than by the practical use of fission energy. 

53
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,630
In particular, we are interested in the control of the chain reaction 

54
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,435
that we have already presented in video 2.10.

55
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:56,240
To fission 235U, one needs slow neutrons. 

56
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,555
The chain reaction is not a self-regulating process, it is influenced by neutron flux and energy.

57
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:08,870
Could you expand on that?

58
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,480
>> To some extent the process is still self-regulating,

59
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:23,530
but let me first briefly explain what is going on inside the reactor

60
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:32,060
during its operation, of course simplifying a bit.

61
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,450
The energy, which heats the fuel rods, is produced by the fission of heavy nuclei such as 235U.

62
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:44,740
If much heat is to be produced, many nuclei must be fissioned per unit of time;

63
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,040
if less heat is required, the fission rate must be reduced. 

64
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:59,370
Fission is induced by neutrons of relatively modest kinetic energy, 

65
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,520
we call them thermal neutrons.

66
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,640
To control fission, it is simply a matter of ensuring

67
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,760
that the proper amount of thermal neutrons is available at all times to generate fissions

68
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,580
- not too much, but not too little either.

69
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,400
The control parameter is therefore the neutron flux. 

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,670
The systems for measuring this flux are placed outside the reactor pressure vessel,

71
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,630
they can measure the neutron flux

72
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,070
over a very large range of about 10 decades.

73
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,140
>> Thus the measurement of the neutron flux is carried out outside the reactor. But how is this flow controlled?

74
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,380
>> At each fission reaction two to three neutrons of high kinetic energy are released. 

75
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:08,040
They are called fast neutrons.

76
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,050
If the energy produced by the reactor is to remain stable, the fission rate must be kept constant,

77
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,060
i.e. each fission must be capable of generating a single subsequent fission.

78
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:30,500
For this purpose, it is necessary to ensure that from two to three neutrons there remains on average only one fast neutron,

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,680
the high energy of which must then be reduced to the thermal level.

80
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:45,470
In this way one has one thermal neutron to generate the next fission.

81
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:52,455
>> This thus concerns first the neutron flux. How do we reduce this flux and how do we reduce the energy of neutrons, both of which are too high?

82
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:59,580
>> The neutron flux is regulated by a more or less strong absorption, by the capture of neutrons.

83
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,890
For this purpose, control rods are used which contain a material, which has a large cross-section for the absorption of neutrons.

84
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:16,525
On the other hand, the cooling water of the fuel rods contains boron.

85
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:22,160
Boron also has a high efficiency for neutron absorption.

86
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,435
By inserting the control rods more or less deeply, and by varying the concentration of boron

87
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:34,710
in the cooling water, the flux of neutrons is influenced.

88
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,750
>> So the neutron flux is regulated to the right level. 

89
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,790
It remains to reduce their energy such that they can generate fission.

90
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:53,980
>> Fast neutrons are slowed down to thermal energy by a moderator.

91
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,730
In a pressurized water reactor, the boron in the cooling water also acts as moderator,

92
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,480
in addition to its role as a neutron absorber.

93
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,480
In this way, the remaining neutrons are thermalized.

94
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,480
>> You mentioned at the beginning the astonishing fact that the fission chain reaction has some self-regulating component.

95
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Can you go into some detail?

96
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,480
>> During the operation of the reactor two feedback effects occur. 

97
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,480
By increasing the temperature of the fuel, the relative movement of the 238U nuclei increases, which causes an increased absorption of neutrons by Doppler effect.

98
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,480
When neutron absorption increases, there are fewer that are available for the next fission.

99
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,480
At the same time, the temperature of the cooling water increases, which causes a decrease in density and a less effective moderation.

100
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,480
These two mechanisms eventually decrease the fission rate 

101
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,480
as the temperature increases, such that the temperature is reduced automatically. 

102
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,480
>> Despite this fact, a regulation of the reactor is necessary to keep under control the chain reaction, which could escape control and cause major accidents.

103
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,480
How is it ensured that the control of a nuclear reactor works?

104
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,480
>> When operating a nuclear power plant the following important safety goals must be ensured in a consistent manner:

105
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,480
1. One must be able to stop fission instantaneously, that is to say to stop the chain reaction at any time.

106
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,480
2. The reactor core, that is to say the fuel rods must be cooled at all times, including after the reactor has been switched off.

107
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,480
3. The enclosure of radioactivity must be ensured permanently.

108
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,480
4. One must avoid that radioactive material can contaminate the environment.

109
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:10,480
These principles are absolutely to be respected.

110
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
>> These are the principles. 

111
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
But how does one implement these goals, and how does one ensure that they are indeed respected?

112
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,480
>> To ensure this, the principles and rules that are defined by the national and 

113
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,480
international authorities must already be respected at the planning stage.

114
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,480
When a plant is built, compliance with the requirements

115
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,480
is monitored by the competent authorities in a consistent manner.

116
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,480
The requirements ultimately result from a consistent application

117
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,480
of the principle of "defence in depth" 

118
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,480
and the concept of multiple barriers for the isolation of radioactivity.

119
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,480
>>  "Defence in depth" has a little aftertaste of military strategy. 

120
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Could you explain that to us a bit more?

121
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,480
>> The comparison with the military significance is in fact justified. 

122
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,480
It means actually implementing a defence against accidents staggered in depth.

123
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,480
It can be characterized as a chain of tiered security measures.

124
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,480
It includes, for example, choosing a suitable reactor concept, 

125
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,480
but also redundant systems, that is to say several systems for the same purpose.

126
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:00,480
These redundant systems are chosen on purpose from different technologies, 

127
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,480
such that the same incident cannot occur twice simultaneously.

128
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,480
And in particular the training and know-how of the employees are essential

129
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,480
elements in this accident protection concept staggered in depth.

130
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,480
>> Nevertheless, accidents are known to have occurred.

131
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,480
The last serious accident was that of Fukushima.

132
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,480
And as a result of these accidents a few countries, including Switzerland and Germany, 

133
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,480
have decided to stop the use of nuclear energy in the long term,

134
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,480
and to rely on renewable energies such as wind-, water- and the solar energy.

135
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Despite this fact, Axpo continues to invest in the maintenance and operation of its oldest nuclear power plant.

136
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Can you resolve this apparent contradiction?

137
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,480
>> When we analyze the situation more thoroughly, we realize that few countries 

138
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,480
in the world have decided to reverse their nuclear policy after the Fukushima accident.

139
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Many countries have even decided to invest anew in nuclear technology to ensure their electricity supply.

140
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,480
By early 2014, 437 reactors were operating in 31 countries.

141
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,480
There are 72 new power plant projects worldwide, including 20 in China.

142
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,480
But, as I noted at the beginning, Axpo is not only a leader in the production of nuclear and hydropower,

143
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,480
but also in the exploitation of renewable energy source, especially in wind farms.

144
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,480
In line with the ideas of the Federal Council and parliaments, Axpo plans its future without the construction of new nuclear power plants.

145
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,480
But the continued operation of existing proven plants, 

146
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,480
as long as they are safe and economical, 

147
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,480
is for Axpo an important and even necessary prerequisite for a successful implementation of the Federal Council’s strategy.

148
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,480
The operation of existing nuclear power plants is also of great importance for the continuity of electricity supply in Switzerland. 

149
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,480
A dependency on foreign countries is in my opinion, and that of Axpo, neither effective nor economically desirable.

150
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,480
>> This seems comprehensible to me. Another problem amply discussed is of course the storage

151
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,480
of highly radioactive waste, also partially highly toxic, which is produced in a nuclear power plant.

152
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,480
How do you see the solution to this problem?

153
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,480
>> There's no ambiguity. Radioactive waste must be disposed of in such a way

154
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,480
that the sustainable protection of man and the environment is ensured at all times.

155
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,480
To this end, the whole chain of waste must be scrupulously rethought, from its generation in the nuclear plant, its conditioning,

156
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,480
through temporary storage until a final disposal in geological formations.

157
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Each step must be treated carefully. Ultimately, waste must be permanently isolated 

158
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,480
from the habitat so that it cannot re-enter the biosphere and the food chain.

159
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,480
>> But this must be ensured over enormous periods of some 100,000 years. 

160
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,480
This is not an easy exercise. What is your vision of final storage over such long periods?

161
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,480
For almost all countries that use nuclear energy, the chain of disposal of highly radioactive 

162
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,480
waste ends with storage in deep layers of geologically stable rock.

163
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,480
In the international circle of experts there is also a consensus that well-designed 

164
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,480
deep underground repositories ensure long-term safe isolation of radioactive substances.

165
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Thus the protection of man and the environment can be assured. 

166
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,480
In Swiss legislation, final deep underground storage is even mandatory. There are no alternatives to this.

167
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,480
>> In spite of this, there is a non-negligible resistance of the population against such storage facilities in their neighborhood.

168
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,480
How can one find a place of storage that is accepted by the public and at the same time meets the requirements of geological safety?

169
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,480
>> It is also unanimously accepted internationally that the establishment of such a deep underground repository imperatively requires a step-by-step approach.

170
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,480
The results of a preliminary phase must be taken into account in the planning and implementation of the next phase.

171
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,480
The constant development of science and technology must also be taken into account.

172
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,480
This makes the process of identifying a storage site a long one. 

173
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,480
But this ensures that one can find the optimal alternative.

174
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,480
>> At any given moment. >> Correct.

175
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,480
>> Thank you, Dr. Weidmann, for this interesting and open discussion.

176
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I would like to thank Dr. Urs Weidmann for this extremely informative and open discussion.

177
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:56,480
And I would also like to thank Mrs Christine Müller, the director of Axporama,

178
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,480
for opening the doors of this exhibition, which I highly recommend

179
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,000
for an instructive and didactic visit.
