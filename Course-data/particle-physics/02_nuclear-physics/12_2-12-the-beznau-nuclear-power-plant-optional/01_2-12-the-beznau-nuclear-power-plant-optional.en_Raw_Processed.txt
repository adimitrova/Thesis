music this second module, 
we discussing physics atomic nucleus 
in video , physical principles nuclear fission discussed 
in video , explained 
principles implemented to build a nuclear reactor 
today, we visit beznau nuclear power plant, 
in production since , making oldest nuclear power plant 
that is still commercially exploited 
power plant welcomes us in showroom 
called axporama, you see around 
watching this video, you will know to three things 
first is to describe operation a 
pressurized water nuclear power plant beznau 
second is to describe regulation mechanisms 
chain reaction 
security mechanisms that monitor safety this process 
third, appreciate role nuclear energy 
in mix energy production in switzerland, 
in europe in world 
today we invited to beznau nuclear power station, belongs to axpo sa 
we in axporama exhibition, is part plant, 
informs visitors year energy in general nuclear energy production nuclear fission in particular 
host today is dr urs weidmann 
is a particle physicist like 
is a graduate university zrich an experimental work violation muon number, 
still a topical field research, is still pursued paul scherrer institute far here 
obtained phd university bern, influence co emissions climate, 
still a topic high interest years phd in particular, made a model ocean currents 
influence adsorption co seawater, delay this causes climate effect 
use nuclear power produces virtually co, 
so seems logical that doctorate moved to federal inspectorate nuclear security ensi 
there changed to nagra, swiss competence center storage radioactive waste 
years to a nuclear power producer, that is to say beznau nuclear power plant, first in monitoring department, 
in electrotechnical department finally years director power plant 
thank you much, dr weidmann, that you available this course broad background knowledge 
could you briefly introduce us to axpo company 
axpo is a swiss power company owned cantons northeastern switzerland 
group produces, sells distributes energy million people several thousand companies in switzerland 
is leader in production electricity hydraulic nuclear origin, well renewable energy sources, in particular wind power 
axpo is active in countries employs around , people, including , in switzerland 
so a major company 
could you briefly introduce us to beznau nuclear power plant, kkb, you director 
kkb consists two identical pressurized water reactors westinghouse 
two blocks a net electrical power mw 
production two blocks covers swiss electricity consumption 
beznau nuclear power plant complies modern safety requirements 
this high standard security maintained constant updates renewal investments billion swiss francs 
in this way is assured that kkb, operation years, always fulfilled current requirements in safety, 
in several aspects even surpassed 
swiss supervisory authority, ifsn, confirmed this fact several occasions 
axpo plans to operate nuclear power plants long safe economically viable 
we interested in this course less economic aspect practical use fission energy 
in particular, we interested in control chain reaction 
that we already presented in video 
to fission u, one needs slow neutrons 
chain reaction is a selfregulating process, is influenced neutron flux energy 
could you expand that 
to extent process is still selfregulating, 
let first briefly explain is going inside reactor 
operation, course simplifying a bit 
energy, heats fuel rods, is produced fission heavy nuclei u 
if much heat is to produced, many nuclei must fissioned per unit time 
if less heat is required, fission rate must reduced 
fission is induced neutrons relatively modest kinetic energy, 
we call thermal neutrons 
to control fission, is simply a matter ensuring 
that proper amount thermal neutrons is available times to generate fissions 
much, little either 
control parameter is therefore neutron flux 
systems measuring this flux placed outside reactor pressure vessel, 
measure neutron flux 
a large range decades 
thus measurement neutron flux is carried outside reactor is this flow controlled 
fission reaction two to three neutrons high kinetic energy released 
called fast neutrons 
if energy produced reactor is to remain stable, fission rate must kept constant, 
ie fission must capable generating a single subsequent fission 
this purpose, is necessary to ensure that two to three neutrons there remains average one fast neutron, 
high energy must reduced to thermal level 
in this way one one thermal neutron to generate next fission 
this thus concerns first neutron flux we reduce this flux we reduce energy neutrons, high 
neutron flux is regulated a less strong absorption, capture neutrons 
this purpose, control rods used contain a material, a large crosssection absorption neutrons 
hand, cooling water fuel rods contains boron 
boron also a high efficiency neutron absorption 
inserting control rods less deeply, varying concentration boron 
in cooling water, flux neutrons is influenced 
so neutron flux is regulated to right level 
remains to reduce energy that generate fission 
fast neutrons slowed to thermal energy a moderator 
in a pressurized water reactor, boron in cooling water also acts moderator, 
in addition to role a neutron absorber 
in this way, remaining neutrons thermalized 
you mentioned beginning astonishing fact that fission chain reaction selfregulating component 
you go detail 
operation reactor two feedback effects occur 
increasing temperature fuel, relative movement u nuclei increases, causes an increased absorption neutrons doppler effect 
neutron absorption increases, there fewer that available next fission 
time, temperature cooling water increases, causes a decrease in density a less effective moderation 
two mechanisms eventually decrease fission rate 
temperature increases, that temperature is reduced automatically 
despite this fact, a regulation reactor is necessary to keep control chain reaction, could escape control cause major accidents 
is ensured that control a nuclear reactor works 
operating a nuclear power plant following important safety goals must ensured in a consistent manner 
one must able to stop fission instantaneously, that is to say to stop chain reaction time 
reactor core, that is to say fuel rods must cooled times, including reactor switched 
enclosure radioactivity must ensured permanently 
one must avoid that radioactive material contaminate environment 
principles absolutely to respected 
principles 
one implement goals, one ensure that indeed respected 
to ensure this, principles rules that defined national 
international authorities must already respected planning stage 
a plant is built, compliance requirements 
is monitored competent authorities in a consistent manner 
requirements ultimately result a consistent application 
principle defence in depth 
concept multiple barriers isolation radioactivity 
defence in depth a little aftertaste military strategy 
could you explain that to us a bit 
comparison military significance is in fact justified 
means actually implementing a defence accidents staggered in depth 
characterized a chain tiered security measures 
includes, example, choosing a suitable reactor concept, 
also redundant systems, that is to say several systems purpose 
redundant systems chosen purpose different technologies, 
that incident cannot occur twice simultaneously 
in particular training knowhow employees essential 
elements in this accident protection concept staggered in depth 
nevertheless, accidents known to occurred 
last serious accident that fukushima 
a result accidents a few countries, including switzerland germany, 
decided to stop use nuclear energy in long term, 
to rely renewable energies wind, water solar energy 
despite this fact, axpo continues to invest in maintenance operation oldest nuclear power plant 
you resolve this apparent contradiction 
we analyze situation thoroughly, we realize that few countries 
in world decided to reverse nuclear policy fukushima accident 
many countries even decided to invest anew in nuclear technology to ensure electricity supply 
early , reactors operating in countries 
there new power plant projects worldwide, including in china 
but, i noted beginning, axpo is a leader in production nuclear hydropower, 
also in exploitation renewable energy source, especially in wind farms 
in line ideas federal council parliaments, axpo plans future without construction new nuclear power plants 
continued operation existing proven plants, 
long safe economical, 
is axpo an important even necessary prerequisite a successful implementation federal councils strategy 
operation existing nuclear power plants is also great importance continuity electricity supply in switzerland 
a dependency foreign countries is in opinion, that axpo, neither effective economically desirable 
this seems comprehensible to another problem amply discussed is course storage 
highly radioactive waste, also partially highly toxic, is produced in a nuclear power plant 
you see solution to this problem 
theres ambiguity radioactive waste must disposed in a way 
that sustainable protection man environment is ensured times 
to this end, whole chain waste must scrupulously rethought, generation in nuclear plant, conditioning, 
temporary storage until a final disposal in geological formations 
step must treated carefully ultimately, waste must permanently isolated 
habitat so that cannot reenter biosphere food chain 
this must ensured enormous periods , years 
this is an easy exercise is vision final storage long periods 
almost countries that use nuclear energy, chain disposal highly radioactive 
waste ends storage in deep layers geologically stable rock 
in international circle experts there is also a consensus that welldesigned 
deep underground repositories ensure longterm safe isolation radioactive substances 
thus protection man environment assured 
in swiss legislation, final deep underground storage is even mandatory there alternatives to this 
in spite this, there is a nonnegligible resistance population storage facilities in neighborhood 
one find a place storage that is accepted public time meets requirements geological safety 
is also unanimously accepted internationally that establishment a deep underground repository imperatively requires a stepbystep approach 
results a preliminary phase must taken account in planning implementation next phase 
constant development science technology must also taken account 
this makes process identifying a storage site a long one 
this ensures that one find optimal alternative 
given moment correct 
thank you, dr weidmann, this interesting open discussion 
i would like to thank dr urs weidmann this extremely informative open discussion 
i would also like to thank mrs christine mller, director axporama, 
opening doors this exhibition, i highly recommend 
an instructive didactic visit
