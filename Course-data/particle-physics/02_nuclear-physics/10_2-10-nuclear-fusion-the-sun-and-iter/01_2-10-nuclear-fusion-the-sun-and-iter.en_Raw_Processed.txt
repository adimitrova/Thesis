second module, we dealing 
nuclear physics applications 
in this tenth video, 
we show a portion nuclear 
binding energy 
transformed heat fusion 
watched this video, 
you will know principle 
energy release nuclear fusion 
you will know stars 
use fusion to produce 
energy also heavy elements 
you will know application 
this principle to future power plants 
let us return to spectrum 
binding energy per nucleon 
a function mass number a 
we see that there is a maximum 
a around iron 
lighter nuclei, 
dependence binding energy 
a is much stronger heavier nuclei 
light nuclei generally 
less strongly bound except 
double magic nuclei, 
like instance he, 
binding energy 
increases faster a 
one therefore use this strong 
variation binding energy respect 
to mass number light nuclei 
a source energy fusion 
yield energy per nucleon is 
greater is obtained fission 
yield per nucleus is smaller 
lower mass number a 
in case, 
natural abundance light nuclei 
make this process interesting 
in particular, fusion light 
elements is source energy in stars 
in principle, fusion occur 
two light nuclei come 
close together enough so 
that merge 
to occur, 
to overcome coulomb barrier 
maximum potential is reached 
two nuclei touch 
a mass number eight, this 
maximum potential is order 
mev, so a kinetic energy a few 
mev overcome barrier 
one must thus heat nuclei 
high temperature, 
so that overcome 
coulomb barrier 
to estimate this temperature, 
lets say that nucleus must 
a kinetic energy mev, 
corresponds to a temperature 
billion kelvin 
typical temperatures inside sun 
stars order 
million kelvin 
tail maxwell distribution 
sun spectrum reaches far enough 
fusion to take place 
currently in heart sun, 
every second million 
tons hydrogen fuse 
produce million tons helium 
difference in mass 
million tons hydrogen is 
order mass giza 
pyramid is equivalent to luminous 
energy produced, is 
joules 
sun will still burn 
million years 
running fuel 
ideal conditions 
nuclear fusion prevail within stars 
an example is sun, 
weighs kg, 
mainly in form 
ionized hydrogen 
main source suns 
energy is hydrogen combustion, 
protonproton cycle 
shown in this schematic 
large energy release in third 
stage is due to fact that 
helium nucleus is doubly magic 
extremely tightly bound 
in total, a cycle fuses four hydrogen 
nuclei to produce two positrons, 
two neutrinos, two photons 
mev kinetic energy 
positrons annihilate 
ambient electrons so 
contribute to total energy release 
photons also interact stellar 
matter deposit energy 
neutrinos escape 
helium produced in protonproton cycle 
produce carbon 
a double fusion 
synthesis elements 
in stars, cno cycle, 
so called carbon cycle, is fundamental 
stars heavier sun this 
is even dominant energy source 
nitrogen oxygen produced in 
this cyclic exothermal reaction 
in addition positrons 
photons emitted in process 
neutrinos escape sun 
often without interacting 
elements to iron abundantly cooked inside 
stars following similar cycles 
even beyond, chain stop 
stable unstable elements 
produced favorable conditions 
one finds elements iron beyond 
in cosmic rays exploding stars in 
supernovae 
chemical composition is however 
modified interaction 
interstellar medium 
example, lithiumberylliumboron group 
is enriched spallation heavier nuclei 
in general, 
abundance odd nuclei is 
important in cosmic ray inside stars 
experiment, alpha 
magnetic spectrometer 
ams international space station 
is taking data since several years 
is measuring 
chemical composition cosmic 
rays function 
energy high precision 
this will enrich knowledge 
origin propagation cosmic rays 
there is a substantial effort 
to achieve a man made 
nuclear fusion 
controlled conditions 
various fusion processes 
between deuterium 
tritium observed 
in laboratory conditions 
important one is deuterium 
plus tritium produces 
plus a neutron plus a mev energy 
main difficulty 
a fusion reactor is to maintain fuel 
long enough a sufficiently 
high temperature, so 
that penetrate coulomb barrier 
often enough to a sustained process 
contain a plasma in two ways, 
magnetic confinement, 
plasma flows in a helical orbit, 
inertial confinement, 
electromagnetic energy via lasers 
heavy ions 
is injected a small 
area that contains fuel 
iter, is international 
thermonuclear experiment reactor, is 
largest current project aim 
demonstrating fusion energy production 
reactor is built 
in south france 
in next two videos, 
we will take you to visit
