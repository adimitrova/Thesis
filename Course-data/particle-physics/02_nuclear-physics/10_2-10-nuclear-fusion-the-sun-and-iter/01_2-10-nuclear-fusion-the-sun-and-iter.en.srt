2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,696
During the second module, we are dealing
with nuclear physics and its applications.

3
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:20,556
In this tenth video,
we show how a portion of the nuclear

4
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:25,030
binding energy can be
transformed into heat by fusion.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,840
After having watched this video,

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
you will know the principle of
energy release by nuclear fusion.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,750
You will know how the stars
use fusion to produce

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,870
their energy and also heavy elements.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,530
And you will know the application of
this principle to future power plants.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,120
Let us return to the spectrum of
the binding energy per nucleon

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,080
as a function on the mass number A.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,170
We see that there is a maximum for
A = 60 around iron.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,750
For lighter nuclei,

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,170
the dependence of the binding energy on
A is much stronger than for heavier nuclei.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,070
Light nuclei are generally
less strongly bound except for

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,860
the double magic nuclei,
like for instance He-4,

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,620
and their binding energy
increases faster with A.

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:26,200
One can therefore use this strong
variation of binding energy with respect

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,720
to the mass number of light nuclei
as a source of energy by fusion.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,920
The yield of energy per nucleon is
greater than what is obtained by fission.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,950
But the yield per nucleus is smaller
because of the lower mass number A.

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,880
In any case,

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,790
the natural abundance of light nuclei
make this process interesting.

24
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,810
In particular, the fusion of light
elements is the source of energy in stars.

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,523
In principle, fusion can occur
when two light nuclei come

26
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:07,640
close together enough so
that they can merge.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,520
But for these to occur,
they have to overcome the Coulomb barrier.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,710
The maximum potential is reached
when the two nuclei just touch.

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,110
For a mass number of about eight, this
maximum potential is of the order of

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,880
4 MeV, so a kinetic energy of a few
MeV can overcome the barrier.

31
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,560
One must thus heat nuclei
at very high temperature,

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,740
so that they can overcome
the Coulomb barrier.

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,970
To estimate this temperature,

34
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,610
let's say that each nucleus must
have a kinetic energy of 2 MeV,

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,190
which corresponds to a temperature
of 10 billion Kelvin.

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,120
Typical temperatures inside the sun and

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,480
other stars are of the order
of 15 million Kelvin.

38
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,340
But the tail of the Maxwell distribution
of the Sun spectrum reaches far enough for

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,550
fusion to take place.

40
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,957
Currently in the heart of the sun,

41
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:17,766
every second about 627 million
tons of hydrogen fuse and

42
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,311
produce about 622 million tons of helium.

43
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:27,524
The difference in mass of 4.3
million tons of hydrogen which is

44
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:33,209
of the order of the mass of the Giza
Pyramid is equivalent to the luminous

45
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,160
energy produced, which is about
4 10^26 Joules.

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,014
The Sun will still burn for

47
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:46,959
1 million years before
running out of fuel.

48
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,662
Ideal conditions for
nuclear fusion prevail within stars.

49
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:54,750
An example is the Sun,
which weighs about 10^30 kg,

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,380
mainly in the form
of ionized hydrogen.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,490
The main source of the sun's
energy is the hydrogen combustion,

52
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,300
the proton-proton cycle
shown in this schematic.

53
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,080
The large energy release in the third
stage is due to the fact that the

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,130
helium nucleus is doubly magic and
extremely tightly bound.

55
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,670
In total, a cycle fuses four hydrogen
nuclei to produce two positrons,

56
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,800
two neutrinos, two photons and
24.68 MeV of kinetic energy.

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,580
Positrons annihilate with
ambient electrons and so

58
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,870
contribute to the total energy release.

59
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,010
Photons can also interact with stellar
matter and deposit their energy.

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,300
Neutrinos escape.

61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,410
Helium produced in the proton-proton cycle

62
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,880
can then produce carbon
through a double fusion.

63
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:03,290
For the synthesis of the elements
in stars, the CNO cycle,

64
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,490
or so called carbon cycle, is fundamental.

65
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,600
For stars heavier than the Sun this
is even the dominant energy source.

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,660
Nitrogen and oxygen are produced in
this cyclic exothermal reaction.

67
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,545
In addition positrons and
photons are emitted in the process.

68
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:29,341
Neutrinos escape from the Sun
often without interacting.

69
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:40,050
Elements up to iron are abundantly cooked inside
stars following similar cycles.

70
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,500
Even beyond, the chain does not stop. 

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,850
All stable and unstable elements can be
produced under favorable conditions.

72
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,863
One finds elements up iron and beyond
in cosmic rays from exploding stars in

73
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:55,950
supernovae.

74
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,960
Their chemical composition is however
modified by interaction with

75
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,700
the interstellar medium.

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,740
For example, the lithium-beryllium-boron group 
is enriched by spallation of heavier nuclei.

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,280
In general,

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,800
the abundance of odd nuclei is more
important in cosmic ray than inside stars.

79
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,570
Our experiment, the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer

80
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,190
AMS on the International Space Station
is taking data since several years

81
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,770
and is measuring the
chemical composition of cosmic

82
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,880
rays as function of their
energy with high precision.

83
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,880
This will enrich our knowledge on
the origin and propagation of cosmic rays.

84
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,175
There is a substantial effort
to achieve a man made

85
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:51,520
nuclear fusion under
controlled conditions.

86
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,230
Various fusion processes
between deuterium and

87
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,190
tritium have been observed
in laboratory conditions.

88
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,854
The most important one is deuterium
plus tritium which produces He-4

89
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:10,745
plus a neutron plus a 17.6 MeV of energy.

90
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:16,160
The main difficulty for
a fusion reactor is to maintain the fuel

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,280
long enough at a sufficiently
high temperature, so

92
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:28,090
that it can penetrate the Coulomb barrier
often enough to have a sustained process.

93
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,290
Once can contain a plasma in two ways,
by magnetic confinement,

94
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,020
where the plasma flows in a helical orbit,
or by inertial confinement,

95
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,930
where electromagnetic energy via lasers or
heavy ions

96
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,460
is injected into a small
area that contains the fuel.

97
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,800
ITER, which is the International
Thermonuclear Experiment Reactor, is

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,880
the largest current project with the aim
of demonstrating fusion energy production.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,610
The reactor is being built
in the south of France.

100
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,950
In the next two videos,
we will take you to visit

101
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,394
the experimental Tokamak
reactor at EPFL in Lausanne and

102
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:20,052
the world's oldest working
nuclear power plants in Beznau.
