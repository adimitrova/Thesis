during
the
second
module
,
we
are
dealing
with
nuclear
physics
and
its
applications
.
in
this
tenth
video
,
we
show
how
a
portion
of
the
nuclear
binding
energy
can
be
transformed
into
heat
by
fusion
.
after
having
watched
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
principle
of
energy
release
by
nuclear
fusion
.
you
will
know
how
the
stars
use
fusion
to
produce
their
energy
and
also
heavy
elements
.
and
you
will
know
the
application
of
this
principle
to
future
power
plants
.
let
us
return
to
the
spectrum
of
the
binding
energy
per
nucleon
as
a
function
on
the
mass
number
a.
we
see
that
there
is
a
maximum
for
a
=
60
around
iron
.
for
lighter
nuclei
,
the
dependence
of
the
binding
energy
on
a
is
much
stronger
than
for
heavier
nuclei
.
light
nuclei
are
generally
less
strongly
bound
except
for
the
double
magic
nuclei
,
like
for
instance
he-4
,
and
their
binding
energy
increases
faster
with
a.
one
can
therefore
use
this
strong
variation
of
binding
energy
with
respect
to
the
mass
number
of
light
nuclei
as
a
source
of
energy
by
fusion
.
the
yield
of
energy
per
nucleon
is
greater
than
what
is
obtained
by
fission
.
but
the
yield
per
nucleus
is
smaller
because
of
the
lower
mass
number
a.
in
any
case
,
the
natural
abundance
of
light
nuclei
make
this
process
interesting
.
in
particular
,
the
fusion
of
light
elements
is
the
source
of
energy
in
stars
.
in
principle
,
fusion
can
occur
when
two
light
nuclei
come
close
together
enough
so
that
they
can
merge
.
but
for
these
to
occur
,
they
have
to
overcome
the
coulomb
barrier
.
the
maximum
potential
is
reached
when
the
two
nuclei
just
touch
.
for
a
mass
number
of
about
eight
,
this
maximum
potential
is
of
the
order
of
4
mev
,
so
a
kinetic
energy
of
a
few
mev
can
overcome
the
barrier
.
one
must
thus
heat
nuclei
at
very
high
temperature
,
so
that
they
can
overcome
the
coulomb
barrier
.
to
estimate
this
temperature
,
let
's
say
that
each
nucleus
must
have
a
kinetic
energy
of
2
mev
,
which
corresponds
to
a
temperature
of
10
billion
kelvin
.
typical
temperatures
inside
the
sun
and
other
stars
are
of
the
order
of
15
million
kelvin
.
but
the
tail
of
the
maxwell
distribution
of
the
sun
spectrum
reaches
far
enough
for
fusion
to
take
place
.
currently
in
the
heart
of
the
sun
,
every
second
about
627
million
tons
of
hydrogen
fuse
and
produce
about
622
million
tons
of
helium
.
the
difference
in
mass
of
4.3
million
tons
of
hydrogen
which
is
of
the
order
of
the
mass
of
the
giza
pyramid
is
equivalent
to
the
luminous
energy
produced
,
which
is
about
4
10^26
joules
.
the
sun
will
still
burn
for
1
million
years
before
running
out
of
fuel
.
ideal
conditions
for
nuclear
fusion
prevail
within
stars
.
an
example
is
the
sun
,
which
weighs
about
10^30
kg
,
mainly
in
the
form
of
ionized
hydrogen
.
the
main
source
of
the
sun
's
energy
is
the
hydrogen
combustion
,
the
proton-proton
cycle
shown
in
this
schematic
.
the
large
energy
release
in
the
third
stage
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
helium
nucleus
is
doubly
magic
and
extremely
tightly
bound
.
in
total
,
a
cycle
fuses
four
hydrogen
nuclei
to
produce
two
positrons
,
two
neutrinos
,
two
photons
and
24.68
mev
of
kinetic
energy
.
positrons
annihilate
with
ambient
electrons
and
so
contribute
to
the
total
energy
release
.
photons
can
also
interact
with
stellar
matter
and
deposit
their
energy
.
neutrinos
escape
.
helium
produced
in
the
proton-proton
cycle
can
then
produce
carbon
through
a
double
fusion
.
for
the
synthesis
of
the
elements
in
stars
,
the
cno
cycle
,
or
so
called
carbon
cycle
,
is
fundamental
.
for
stars
heavier
than
the
sun
this
is
even
the
dominant
energy
source
.
nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
produced
in
this
cyclic
exothermal
reaction
.
in
addition
positrons
and
photons
are
emitted
in
the
process
.
neutrinos
escape
from
the
sun
often
without
interacting
.
elements
up
to
iron
are
abundantly
cooked
inside
stars
following
similar
cycles
.
even
beyond
,
the
chain
does
not
stop
.
all
stable
and
unstable
elements
can
be
produced
under
favorable
conditions
.
one
finds
elements
up
iron
and
beyond
in
cosmic
rays
from
exploding
stars
in
supernovae
.
their
chemical
composition
is
however
modified
by
interaction
with
the
interstellar
medium
.
for
example
,
the
lithium-beryllium-boron
group
is
enriched
by
spallation
of
heavier
nuclei
.
in
general
,
the
abundance
of
odd
nuclei
is
more
important
in
cosmic
ray
than
inside
stars
.
our
experiment
,
the
alpha
magnetic
spectrometer
ams
on
the
international
space
station
is
taking
data
since
several
years
and
is
measuring
the
chemical
composition
of
cosmic
rays
as
function
of
their
energy
with
high
precision
.
this
will
enrich
our
knowledge
on
the
origin
and
propagation
of
cosmic
rays
.
there
is
a
substantial
effort
to
achieve
a
man
made
nuclear
fusion
under
controlled
conditions
.
various
fusion
processes
between
deuterium
and
tritium
have
been
observed
in
laboratory
conditions
.
the
most
important
one
is
deuterium
plus
tritium
which
produces
he-4
plus
a
neutron
plus
a
17.6
mev
of
energy
.
the
main
difficulty
for
a
fusion
reactor
is
to
maintain
the
fuel
long
enough
at
a
sufficiently
high
temperature
,
so
that
it
can
penetrate
the
coulomb
barrier
often
enough
to
have
a
sustained
process
.
once
can
contain
a
plasma
in
two
ways
,
by
magnetic
confinement
,
where
the
plasma
flows
in
a
helical
orbit
,
or
by
inertial
confinement
,
where
electromagnetic
energy
via
lasers
or
heavy
ions
is
injected
into
a
small
area
that
contains
the
fuel
.
iter
,
which
is
the
international
thermonuclear
experiment
reactor
,
is
the
largest
current
project
with
the
aim
of
demonstrating
fusion
energy
production
.
the
reactor
is
being
built
in
the
south
of
france
.
in
the
next
two
videos
,
we
will
take
you
to
visit
the
experimental
tokamak
reactor
at
epfl
in
lausanne
and
the
world
's
oldest
working
nuclear
power
plants
in
beznau
.
