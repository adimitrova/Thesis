2
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:13,960
During the second module,
we are dealing with nuclear physics.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,100
And in this eighth video, we will explain
how to transform a part of the nuclear

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,830
binding energy into heat
by nuclear fission.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,470
After viewing this video, you will
know how the nuclear fission mechanism

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,710
works and its necessary conditions.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,660
A very important application of nuclear
physics is the transformation of nuclear

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,930
binding energy into thermal and electrical
energy by the fission mechanism.

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,538
Low energy neutrons can penetrate inside the nucleus
since they're not subject to Coulomb repulsion.

10
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:55,158
This way they increase
the nuclear mass and

11
00:00:55,158 --> 00:01:00,230
the excited nucleus may break up into
two daughter nuclei of smaller mass.

12
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,090
This fragmentation of a heavy
nucleus into two medium mass

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,940
fragments plus accessory products
is called nuclear fission.

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,161
The alpha decay which we have
discussed in video 2.4 is

15
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:20,590
an extreme example of a very
asymmetric spontaneous fission.

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,496
But more important is the fission
induced by the absorption of a neutron.

17
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:31,410
Nuclear fission stay in the domain
of a heavy matter nuclei and

18
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,040
this is due to the shape of
the binding energy per nucleon as

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,349
a function of the mass number A 
which we have shown in video 2.1.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,990
Beyond the iron group, it decreases
steadily such that binding energy can be

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,300
gained by splitting a heavy nucleus into two
nuclei in a more or less symmetric way.

22
00:01:56,636 --> 00:02:01,992
Thus, a less tightly bound nucleus
can gain binding energy

23
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:07,810
by splitting it into two lighter,
more tightly bound ones.

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,884
As an example,
the binding energy per nucleon

25
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:17,309
is -7.5 MeV for U-235 and

26
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:23,181
-8.4 MeV on average for
the two daughter nuclei.

27
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:30,470
The energy released by fission is
typically 0.9 MeV per nucleon.

28
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,100
One gram of U-235 contains about
3 10^21 nuclei.

29
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,150
The complete fission of all of these
nuclei would release the impressive

30
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,060
energy of 10^11 joules,

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,740
about one megawatt a day if we
ignore all efficiencies involved.

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,130
To give you an idea for
comparison, burning one ton of

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,250
coal yields about 0.36 Megawatt-day,
if again you ignore efficiencies.

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,079
Thus one gram of U-235 contains 
as much nuclear

35
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:19,520
energy as three tons of coal
contain in chemical energy.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,170
We can understand the nuclear fission
qualitatively and quantitatively using

37
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,245
the liquid drop model of the nucleus
which we have introduced in video 2.3.

38
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,231
Let's first look at the process qualitatively.

39
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:41,440
The liquid drop model presumes
a spherical shape of the nucleus.

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,568
But for a heavy nucleus a small external perturbation
like for instance an incident neutron can

41
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:52,958
produce surface waves
leading to a change in shape.

42
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,767
The drop may thus extend into spheroïdal shape and

43
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:02,118
if this perturbation is small enough,
the nucleus will be left excited and

44
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:06,300
just return to its ground
state by emitting a photon.

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,565
This process is called
radiative neutron capture.

46
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:16,219
If on the contrary the perturbation 
is large, Coulomb repulsion

47
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:19,382
along the axis of this spheroïd can split

48
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:24,240
the drop into two droplets by
what is called induced fission.

49
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,280
Now, let us calculate under
which condition this may happen.

50
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,660
A sphere of radius R will turn into
a spheroïd of a constant volume because

51
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,465
of the incompressibility of nuclear matter.

52
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:45,950
We denote its half-axes by a and
b, which is equal to c.

53
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,040
In terms of a small deformation epsilon,

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,070
they transform into
(b - epsilon) and (a + epsilon).

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,910
For the binding energy, the volume 
term stays constant, but the surface and

56
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,600
Coulomb energy are different.

57
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,760
The deformation increases
this surface energy but

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
decreases the Coulomb term.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,980
So the gain or

60
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,930
loss in binding energy will depend on the
relative importance of these two terms.

61
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,990
If the difference is greater than 0, the
spherical nucleus is more tightly bound

62
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,600
and thus stable against
this small perturbation.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,740
If on the contrary,
∆ is less than zero,

64
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,600
the spherical nucleus is less tightly
bound and can undergo fission.

65
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,460
Putting in the typical values for
the coefficients a_2 and a_3,

66
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,160
one obtains stability if the ratio
Z^2/A is less than 47.

67
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,480
There are small quantum corrections
to this classical approach which,

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,280
however, do not change the conclusion.

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,146
We expect on the contrary, that nuclei
which set Z^2 > 47A,

70
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:06,960
are highly unstable against a small perturbation
and thus can be easily induced to fission.

71
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,164
Heavy nuclei have Z < A/2
so  the conditions

72
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:18,429
that Z^2 < 47 A is satisfied.

73
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:22,398
The spherical shape corresponds
to the maximum binding energy but

74
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:26,470
even in that case,
a fission can be energetically favorable,

75
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,590
if the sum of binding energies of the
daughter nuclei is favorable with respect

76
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,850
to the mother nucleus.

77
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,852
Let us calculate this case for a

78
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:45,660
symmetric fission assuming spherical
daughter nuclei for simplicity.

79
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,350
A and Z of the parent nucleus must thus be even.

80
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,970
We again ignore quantum
terms of the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula.

81
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,730
The energy difference is denoted by ∆.

82
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,189
With typical coefficients,
we obtain delta equal to 

83
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:10,510
0.27 A^2/3 (-16.5 + Z^2/A).

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,696
Thus for Z^2 < 16.5A

85
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:21,869
the two daughter nuclei are more tightly
bounded than the mother nucleus.

86
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,156
We thus see that for
the region Z^2 between 16.5A and

87
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:34,747
47A, the spherical shape may
be stable against fission but

88
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:39,908
it remains energetically favorable for
the parent nucleus to split into

89
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:44,990
two smaller ones,
when it is sufficiently perturbed.

90
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Beyond that zone, even a minor
perturbation by a thermal neutron, for

91
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,230
instance, will suffice to cause fission.

92
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,940
Let us consider Uranium
isotopes as an example.

93
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,180
U-238 is an even even nucleus and

94
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,890
thus more tightly bound than U-235,
which is odd even.

95
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:15,180
We thus need a smaller perturbation
to induce fission in U-235.

96
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,920
The activation energy
is about 5 MeV for

97
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,220
U-235 and 6 MeV for U-238.

98
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,780
When capturing a neutron,
U-235 becomes an even-even nucleus.

99
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,990
This transformation releases about 6.5 MeV

100
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,750
of binding energy, which is
sufficient to activate its fission.

101
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,453
For U-238,

102
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:49,420
a neutron capture changes the nucleus
to a less tightly bound odd-even one.

103
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,220
This will be a less exothermal process.

104
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,378
It releases only 4.8 MeV
out of the necessary 6 MeV.

105
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:07,320
So additional 1.2 MeV per neutron
must be provided to induce fission.

106
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,080
The fragments are often rather asymmetric.

107
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,540
One observes a grouping of the daughter
nuclei around mass number 95 and

108
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:23,420
140 as shown in this picture, for
a reason which we have not yet understood.

109
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,050
The picture here in fact shows the mass
spectrum of daughter nuclei from

110
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:36,320
the fission of U-233, U-235,
Pu-239, as well as a mixture.

111
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,800
The mass spectra are similar.

112
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,510
After the fission process the daughter
nuclei are often in a excited states.

113
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,460
And they turn into stable isotopes
by neutron emission.

114
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,173
Neutrons are thus abundant
among the fission products.

115
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:05,590
They can cause a chain reaction
of nuclear fission processes.

116
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,356
U-235 produces on average
2.5 neutrons per fission.

117
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:14,700
These neutrons can in turn induce
new fission reactions and so forth.

118
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,960
To see if a chain reaction can be
maintained, we consider the ratio

119
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,908
k of the number of neutrons
produced in step n+1

120
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:30,440
to the one produced
in step n of the chain.

121
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,770
If k is less than one,
there are not enough neutrons to sustain

122
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,010
a chain reaction, and
the process will stop by itself.

123
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,575
If k is equal to one or around one,
there are just enough neutrons

124
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:50,615
to maintain a chain reaction with a
constant number of fissions at each step.

125
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:54,085
This is the ideal situation for
nuclear fission reactor.

126
00:10:56,105 --> 00:11:02,990
If k is bigger than one, more and more
neutrons will be produced at each stage,

127
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,350
thus leading to an exponential growth
of the number of fission reaction.

128
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,020
And this is the situation which is searched
for the production of nuclear weapons.

129
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,264
In the next video,
we will talk about how to use

130
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:23,729
the fission process in
nuclear power plants.
