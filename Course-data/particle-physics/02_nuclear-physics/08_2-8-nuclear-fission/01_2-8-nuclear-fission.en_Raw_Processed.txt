second module, 
we dealing nuclear physics 
in this eighth video, we will explain 
to transform a part nuclear 
binding energy heat 
nuclear fission 
viewing this video, you will 
know nuclear fission mechanism 
works necessary conditions 
a important application nuclear 
physics is transformation nuclear 
binding energy thermal electrical 
energy fission mechanism 
low energy neutrons penetrate inside nucleus 
since theyre subject to coulomb repulsion 
this way increase 
nuclear mass 
excited nucleus may break 
two daughter nuclei smaller mass 
this fragmentation a heavy 
nucleus two medium mass 
fragments plus accessory products 
is called nuclear fission 
alpha decay we 
discussed in video is 
an extreme example a 
asymmetric spontaneous fission 
important is fission 
induced absorption a neutron 
nuclear fission stay in domain 
a heavy matter nuclei 
this is due to shape 
binding energy per nucleon 
a function mass number a 
we shown in video 
beyond iron group, decreases 
steadily that binding energy 
gained splitting a heavy nucleus two 
nuclei in a less symmetric way 
thus, a less tightly bound nucleus 
gain binding energy 
splitting two lighter, 
tightly bound ones 
an example, 
binding energy per nucleon 
is mev u 
mev average 
two daughter nuclei 
energy released fission is 
typically mev per nucleon 
one gram u contains 
nuclei 
complete fission 
nuclei would release impressive 
energy joules, 
one megawatt a day if we 
ignore efficiencies involved 
to give you an idea 
comparison, burning one ton 
coal yields megawattday, 
if you ignore efficiencies 
thus one gram u contains 
much nuclear 
energy three tons coal 
contain in chemical energy 
we understand nuclear fission 
qualitatively quantitatively using 
liquid drop model nucleus 
we introduced in video 
lets first look process qualitatively 
liquid drop model presumes 
a spherical shape nucleus 
a heavy nucleus a small external perturbation 
like instance an incident neutron 
produce surface waves 
leading to a change in shape 
drop may thus extend spherodal shape 
if this perturbation is small enough, 
nucleus will left excited 
return to ground 
state emitting a photon 
this process is called 
radiative neutron capture 
if contrary perturbation 
is large, coulomb repulsion 
along axis this spherod split 
drop two droplets 
is called induced fission 
now, let us calculate 
condition this may happen 
a sphere radius r will turn 
a spherod a constant volume 
incompressibility nuclear matter 
we denote halfaxes a 
b, is equal to c 
in terms a small deformation epsilon, 
transform 
b epsilon a epsilon 
binding energy, volume 
term stays constant, surface 
coulomb energy different 
deformation increases 
this surface energy 
decreases coulomb term 
so gain 
loss in binding energy will depend 
relative importance two terms 
if difference is greater , 
spherical nucleus is tightly bound 
thus stable 
this small perturbation 
if contrary, 
is less zero, 
spherical nucleus is less tightly 
bound undergo fission 
putting in typical values 
coefficients a a, 
one obtains stability if ratio 
za is less 
there small quantum corrections 
to this classical approach which, 
however, change conclusion 
we expect contrary, that nuclei 
set z a, 
highly unstable a small perturbation 
thus easily induced to fission 
heavy nuclei z a 
so conditions 
that z a is satisfied 
spherical shape corresponds 
to maximum binding energy 
even in that case, 
a fission energetically favorable, 
if sum binding energies 
daughter nuclei is favorable respect 
to mother nucleus 
let us calculate this case a 
symmetric fission assuming spherical 
daughter nuclei simplicity 
a z parent nucleus must thus even 
we ignore quantum 
terms betheweizscker formula 
energy difference is denoted 
typical coefficients, 
we obtain delta equal to 
a za 
thus z a 
two daughter nuclei tightly 
bounded mother nucleus 
we thus see that 
region z between a 
a, spherical shape may 
stable fission 
remains energetically favorable 
parent nucleus to split 
two smaller ones, 
is sufficiently perturbed 
beyond that zone, even a minor 
perturbation a thermal neutron, 
instance, will suffice to cause fission 
let us consider uranium 
isotopes an example 
u is an even even nucleus 
thus tightly bound u, 
is odd even 
we thus need a smaller perturbation 
to induce fission in u 
activation energy 
is mev 
u mev u 
capturing a neutron, 
u becomes an eveneven nucleus 
this transformation releases mev 
binding energy, is 
sufficient to activate fission 
u, 
a neutron capture changes nucleus 
to a less tightly bound oddeven one 
this will a less exothermal process 
releases mev 
necessary mev 
so additional mev per neutron 
must provided to induce fission 
fragments often rather asymmetric 
one observes a grouping daughter 
nuclei around mass number 
shown in this picture, 
a reason we yet understood 
picture here in fact shows mass 
spectrum daughter nuclei 
fission u, u, 
pu, well a mixture 
mass spectra similar 
fission process daughter 
nuclei often in a excited states 
turn stable isotopes 
neutron emission 
neutrons thus abundant 
among fission products 
cause a chain reaction 
nuclear fission processes 
u produces average 
neutrons per fission 
neutrons in turn induce 
new fission reactions so forth 
to see if a chain reaction 
maintained, we consider ratio 
k number neutrons 
produced in step n 
to one produced 
in step n chain 
if k is less one, 
there enough neutrons to sustain 
a chain reaction, 
process will stop 
if k is equal to one around one, 
there enough neutrons 
to maintain a chain reaction a 
constant number fissions step 
this is ideal situation 
nuclear fission reactor 
if k is bigger one, 
neutrons will produced stage, 
thus leading to an exponential growth 
number fission reaction 
this is situation is searched 
production nuclear weapons 
in next video, 
we will talk to use 
fission process in 
nuclear power plants
