in this second module, we in 
process discussing nuclear physics, 
we turn to a few examples 
applications 
in this seventh video, 
we will briefly discuss two applications, 
radiocarbon dating 
imaging nuclear magnetic resonance 
watching this video you will able 
to describe one determines age 
organic substances based 
contents c 
to describe principles imaging 
using nuclear magnetic resonance 
one important applications 
natural radioactivity is dating 
organic materials is 
called radiocarbon method 
this works to several thousand years 
relatively good accuracy 
an example is controversial 
dating turin linen, 
believe to show an imprint 
body jesus death 
is shown in this image behind 
now, let us examine this 
method dates organic materials 
atmosphere contains a lot 
stable n c, 
play an important role 
play in organic processes 
atmosphere is constantly hit cosmic 
rays high energy, consist 
mainly protons helium nuclei, 
also electrons, photons neutrons 
cosmic rays interact 
atmospheric nuclei 
slow neutrons produce, 
among many particles, 
interact n to 
produce radioactive carbon 
isotope c in 
a charge exchange reaction 
carbon is a beta emitter a 
lifetime a bit , years, 
so well suited to date materials 
that several thousand years old 
moment, atmosphere thus 
contains a majority c 
a small quantity c nuclei 
form co molecules, since 
chemical properties 
living organisms, like plants, 
consume carbon dioxide 
photosynthesis, 
will integrate carbon isotopes alike 
organism dies, 
co ingestion stops 
on, 
c component slowly decays, 
level c will stay constant 
one thus uses relative concentration 
two isotopes to estimate 
age fossils 
course, 
concentration c in 
atmosphere is necessarily constant 
depends flux 
cosmic rays a given time 
this dating method thus 
needs a calibration 
this curve shown here gives an example 
deviation linearity 
method 
let us turn to a noninvasive medical 
imaging technique that uses nuclear spin 
imaging nuclear magnetic resonance, 
nmr, is based absorption 
reemission electromagnetic radiation 
via nuclear magnetic moment 
sample is immersed in 
magnetic field b to establish 
an external quantization axis 
component nuclear 
magnetic moment along this axis 
will proportional to quantum 
number ms, is equal to plus 
minus onehalf, 
depending spin orientation 
associated energy is 
proportional to ms b 
transition energy between two 
orientations spin, parallel 
antiparallel to magnetic axis, 
is e hbar gamma b, 
proportionality 
factor gamma is equal to 
gyromagnetic constant 
times e divided m 
spin vector rotates around 
magnetic axis a larmor 
frequency nu, is equal 
to gamma b pi 
a photon thus absorbed 
nucleus if frequency corresponds 
to this resonance in range radio 
frequencies if b is a few tesla 
this resonance use to 
is called nuclear spectroscopy 
you see a nuclear spectroscopy 
apparatus in image right 
let us discuss one 
uses this to locate molecules 
nuclei inside body 
varying magnetic field 
around b gradients in 
three spatial directions, 
one correlate resonance frequency 
position 
a certain type nucleus 
intensity signal 
is proportional 
to local density element 
this is principle nuclear 
magnetic resonance imaging, nmr 
one uses resonance frequencies of, 
example, hydrogen, na, 
p to obtain an image 
internal structure body 
often, 
hydrogen is indeed used to obtain access 
to density distribution liquids 
soft tissues, difficult 
to render classical tomography 
patient is introduced 
a solenoid 
between two helmholtz coils, 
in two examples 
provide field b 
typically a few tesla 
additional coils adapted to 
body region examination 
provide magnetic field gradient 
a pulsed radio frequency 
signal is applied, 
absorption tissue is 
analyzed fourier analysis 
height fourier peak 
resonance frequency 
measures local density 
chosen nucleus 
a characteristic relaxation 
time between milliseconds 
seconds, rf signal is restored 
time delay reveal 
additional tissue properties 
one obtains an image a typical 
resolution order millimeters, 
a good contrast, you see 
in this nmr picture knee 
in addition, 
image shows also soft tissue, 
difficult to visualize 
classical xray tomography 
mechanism nuclear magnetic 
resonance even allows 
a functional imaging organs 
this is due to magnetic 
properties hemoglobin, 
transport oxygen in blood 
hemoglobin is found in 
two different forms 
red blood cells, 
oxygenized lungs, 
contain oxyhemoglobin, 
a molecule is inactive in nmr 
red blood cells, 
delivered oxygen to tissue, 
contain deoxyhemoglobin, 
is a paramagnetic molecule 
this means that influence 
external magnetic field, 
will acquire a magnetization, 
is detectable nmr 
brain activity, 
example, causes characteristic dynamics 
blood flow composition 
in active brain regions, 
neurons stimulated, one observes 
simultaneously a higher oxygen consumption 
a higher local blood flow 
in healthy tissue, 
increase in blood flow is 
important local 
consumption oxygen 
this corresponds to a relative 
decrease in deoxyhemoglobin, 
used to 
localize brain activity 
in next video, well represent 
another important application, 
physical principle energy 
release in nuclear fission, 
is currently furnishing 
global energy consumption
