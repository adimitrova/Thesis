2
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:15,589
In this second module, we are in the
process of discussing nuclear physics, and

3
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:19,620
we now turn to a few examples
of its applications.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,223
In this seventh video,
We will briefly discuss two applications,

5
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:29,360
which are radiocarbon dating and
imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,920
After watching this video you will be able
to describe how one determines the age of

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,570
organic substances based on
their contents of C-14.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,747
And to describe the principles of imaging
using nuclear magnetic resonance.

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:52,733
One of the important applications of
natural radioactivity is the dating of

10
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,390
organic materials by what is
called radiocarbon method.

11
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,170
This works up to several thousand years
and with relatively good accuracy.

12
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,860
An example is the very controversial
dating of the Turin linen,

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,970
which some believe to show an imprint
of the body of Jesus after his death and

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,040
it is shown in this image behind me.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,100
Now, let us examine how this
method dates organic materials.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,923
Our atmosphere contains a lot
stable N-14 and C-12,

17
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:28,650
which play an important role
play in organic processes.

18
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,720
The atmosphere is constantly hit by cosmic
rays and very high energy, they consist

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,240
mainly of protons and helium nuclei, but
also electrons, photons and neutrons.

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,390
Cosmic rays interact
with atmospheric nuclei.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,176
The slow neutrons they produce,
among many other particles,

22
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:48,980
can interact with N-14 to
produce the radioactive carbon

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,300
isotope C-14 in
a charge exchange reaction.

24
00:01:54,935 --> 00:02:00,590
Carbon-14 is a beta emitter with a
lifetime of a bit more than 8,000 years,

25
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,250
so well suited to date materials
that are several thousand years old.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,070
At any moment, our atmosphere thus
contains a majority of C-12 and

27
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,000
a small quantity of C-14 nuclei.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,540
Both of them can form CO2 molecules, since
their chemical properties are the same.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,850
Living organisms, like plants,
consume carbon dioxide for

30
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,970
their photosynthesis, and
will integrate both carbon isotopes alike.

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,440
When the organism dies,
the CO2 ingestion stops.

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,350
From then on,
the C-14 component slowly decays, but

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,170
the level of C-12 will stay constant.

34
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,873
One thus uses the relative concentration
of the two isotopes to estimate

35
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,194
the age of fossils.

36
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,214
But of course,

37
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:55,320
the concentration of C-14 in the
atmosphere is not necessarily constant.

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,943
It depends on the flux of
cosmic rays at a given time and

39
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:02,150
this dating method thus
needs a calibration.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,578
This curve shown here gives an example
of the deviation from linearity of

41
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:09,439
the method.

42
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:17,160
Let us now turn to a noninvasive medical
imaging technique that uses nuclear spin.

43
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,755
Imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance,
NMR, is based on the absorption and

44
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:27,270
re-emission of electromagnetic radiation
via the nuclear magnetic moment.

45
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,250
The sample is immersed in
magnetic field B_0 to establish

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,910
an external quantization axis.

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,160
The component of the nuclear
magnetic moment along this axis

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,090
will be proportional to the quantum
number m_s, which is equal to plus or

49
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,060
minus one-half,
depending on the spin orientation.

50
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,070
The associated energy is
proportional to both m_s and B_0.

51
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,189
The transition energy between the two
orientations of the spin, parallel and

52
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,985
anti-parallel to the magnetic axis,
is âˆ†E = hbar gamma B_0,

53
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:06,421
where the proportionality
factor gamma is equal to

54
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:10,760
the gyromagnetic constant
times e divided by 2M.

55
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,054
The spin vector rotates around
the magnetic axis with a Larmor

56
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:21,839
frequency nu_0, which is equal
to gamma B_0/(2 pi).

57
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,555
A photon can thus be absorbed by
the nucleus if its frequency corresponds

58
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:33,310
to this resonance in the range of radio
frequencies if B_0 is a few tesla.

59
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,070
This resonance can then be use to do
what is called nuclear spectroscopy.

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,640
And you see a nuclear spectroscopy
apparatus in the image on the right.

61
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:51,302
But let us now discuss how one
uses this to locate molecules and

62
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:54,830
nuclei inside your body.

63
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,560
By varying the magnetic field
around B_0 with gradients in all

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,940
three spatial directions,
one can correlate the resonance frequency

65
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,920
with the position of
a certain type of nucleus.

66
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,580
The intensity of the signal
is then proportional

67
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,550
to the local density of the element.

68
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,110
This is the principle of nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging, NMR.

69
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:22,363
One uses the resonance frequencies of,
for example, hydrogen, Na-23,

70
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:28,000
or P-31 to obtain an image of
the internal structure of the body.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Most often,

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,820
hydrogen is indeed used to obtain access
to the density distribution of liquids and

73
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,760
soft tissues, which are difficult
to render by classical tomography.

74
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,198
The patient is introduced
into a solenoid or

75
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:49,170
between two Helmholtz coils,
as in these two examples.

76
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,080
They provide the field B_0
of typically a few tesla.

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,490
Additional coils adapted to
the body region under examination

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,230
provide the magnetic field gradient.

79
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,480
A pulsed radio frequency
signal is then applied, and

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,990
its absorption by the tissue is
analyzed by Fourier analysis.

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,030
The height of the Fourier peak
at the resonance frequency

82
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,860
measures the local density
of the chosen nucleus.

83
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,420
After a characteristic relaxation
time between milliseconds and

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,480
seconds, the RF signal is restored.

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,700
The time delay can reveal
additional tissue properties.

86
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,880
One then obtains an image with a typical
resolution of order millimeters, and

87
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
a very good contrast, as you can see
in this NMR picture of the knee.

88
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,114
In addition,
the image shows also the soft tissue,

89
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:42,072
difficult to visualize by
classical x-ray tomography.

90
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,822
The mechanism of nuclear magnetic
resonance even allows for

91
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,730
a functional imaging of organs.

92
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,780
This is due to the magnetic
properties of hemoglobin,

93
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,530
which transport the oxygen in our blood.

94
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,910
Hemoglobin is found in
two different forms.

95
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,250
The red blood cells,
which are oxygenized by the lungs,

96
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,800
contain oxyhemoglobin,
a molecule which is inactive in NMR.

97
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,180
The red blood cells, which have
delivered the oxygen to the tissue,

98
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,620
contain deoxyhemoglobin,
which is a paramagnetic molecule.

99
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,830
This means that under the influence
of the external magnetic field,

100
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,400
it will acquire a magnetization,
which is detectable by NMR.

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,580
Brain activity, for

102
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,006
example, causes characteristic dynamics
of blood flow and composition.

103
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:39,235
In active brain regions, where
the neurons are stimulated, one observes

104
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:44,547
simultaneously a higher oxygen consumption
and a higher local blood flow.

105
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,745
In healthy tissue,
the increase in blood flow is more

106
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:53,540
important than the local
consumption of oxygen.

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,260
This corresponds to a relative
decrease in deoxyhemoglobin,

108
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,907
which can be used to
localize brain activity.

109
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,961
In the next video, we'll represent
another important application,

110
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,328
the physical principle of energy
release in nuclear fission,

111
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:13,596
which is currently furnishing about
10% of the global energy consumption.
