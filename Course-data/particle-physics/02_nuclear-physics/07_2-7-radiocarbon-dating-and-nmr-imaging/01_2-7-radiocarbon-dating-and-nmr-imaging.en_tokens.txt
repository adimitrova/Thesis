in
this
second
module
,
we
are
in
the
process
of
discussing
nuclear
physics
,
and
we
now
turn
to
a
few
examples
of
its
applications
.
in
this
seventh
video
,
we
will
briefly
discuss
two
applications
,
which
are
radiocarbon
dating
and
imaging
by
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
.
after
watching
this
video
you
will
be
able
to
describe
how
one
determines
the
age
of
organic
substances
based
on
their
contents
of
c-14
.
and
to
describe
the
principles
of
imaging
using
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
.
one
of
the
important
applications
of
natural
radioactivity
is
the
dating
of
organic
materials
by
what
is
called
radiocarbon
method
.
this
works
up
to
several
thousand
years
and
with
relatively
good
accuracy
.
an
example
is
the
very
controversial
dating
of
the
turin
linen
,
which
some
believe
to
show
an
imprint
of
the
body
of
jesus
after
his
death
and
it
is
shown
in
this
image
behind
me
.
now
,
let
us
examine
how
this
method
dates
organic
materials
.
our
atmosphere
contains
a
lot
stable
n-14
and
c-12
,
which
play
an
important
role
play
in
organic
processes
.
the
atmosphere
is
constantly
hit
by
cosmic
rays
and
very
high
energy
,
they
consist
mainly
of
protons
and
helium
nuclei
,
but
also
electrons
,
photons
and
neutrons
.
cosmic
rays
interact
with
atmospheric
nuclei
.
the
slow
neutrons
they
produce
,
among
many
other
particles
,
can
interact
with
n-14
to
produce
the
radioactive
carbon
isotope
c-14
in
a
charge
exchange
reaction
.
carbon-14
is
a
beta
emitter
with
a
lifetime
of
a
bit
more
than
8,000
years
,
so
well
suited
to
date
materials
that
are
several
thousand
years
old
.
at
any
moment
,
our
atmosphere
thus
contains
a
majority
of
c-12
and
a
small
quantity
of
c-14
nuclei
.
both
of
them
can
form
co2
molecules
,
since
their
chemical
properties
are
the
same
.
living
organisms
,
like
plants
,
consume
carbon
dioxide
for
their
photosynthesis
,
and
will
integrate
both
carbon
isotopes
alike
.
when
the
organism
dies
,
the
co2
ingestion
stops
.
from
then
on
,
the
c-14
component
slowly
decays
,
but
the
level
of
c-12
will
stay
constant
.
one
thus
uses
the
relative
concentration
of
the
two
isotopes
to
estimate
the
age
of
fossils
.
but
of
course
,
the
concentration
of
c-14
in
the
atmosphere
is
not
necessarily
constant
.
it
depends
on
the
flux
of
cosmic
rays
at
a
given
time
and
this
dating
method
thus
needs
a
calibration
.
this
curve
shown
here
gives
an
example
of
the
deviation
from
linearity
of
the
method
.
let
us
now
turn
to
a
noninvasive
medical
imaging
technique
that
uses
nuclear
spin
.
imaging
by
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
,
nmr
,
is
based
on
the
absorption
and
re-emission
of
electromagnetic
radiation
via
the
nuclear
magnetic
moment
.
the
sample
is
immersed
in
magnetic
field
b_0
to
establish
an
external
quantization
axis
.
the
component
of
the
nuclear
magnetic
moment
along
this
axis
will
be
proportional
to
the
quantum
number
m_s
,
which
is
equal
to
plus
or
minus
one-half
,
depending
on
the
spin
orientation
.
the
associated
energy
is
proportional
to
both
m_s
and
b_0
.
the
transition
energy
between
the
two
orientations
of
the
spin
,
parallel
and
anti-parallel
to
the
magnetic
axis
,
is
Ã¢ÂÂe
=
hbar
gamma
b_0
,
where
the
proportionality
factor
gamma
is
equal
to
the
gyromagnetic
constant
times
e
divided
by
2m
.
the
spin
vector
rotates
around
the
magnetic
axis
with
a
larmor
frequency
nu_0
,
which
is
equal
to
gamma
b_0/
(
2
pi
)
.
a
photon
can
thus
be
absorbed
by
the
nucleus
if
its
frequency
corresponds
to
this
resonance
in
the
range
of
radio
frequencies
if
b_0
is
a
few
tesla
.
this
resonance
can
then
be
use
to
do
what
is
called
nuclear
spectroscopy
.
and
you
see
a
nuclear
spectroscopy
apparatus
in
the
image
on
the
right
.
but
let
us
now
discuss
how
one
uses
this
to
locate
molecules
and
nuclei
inside
your
body
.
by
varying
the
magnetic
field
around
b_0
with
gradients
in
all
three
spatial
directions
,
one
can
correlate
the
resonance
frequency
with
the
position
of
a
certain
type
of
nucleus
.
the
intensity
of
the
signal
is
then
proportional
to
the
local
density
of
the
element
.
this
is
the
principle
of
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
imaging
,
nmr
.
one
uses
the
resonance
frequencies
of
,
for
example
,
hydrogen
,
na-23
,
or
p-31
to
obtain
an
image
of
the
internal
structure
of
the
body
.
most
often
,
hydrogen
is
indeed
used
to
obtain
access
to
the
density
distribution
of
liquids
and
soft
tissues
,
which
are
difficult
to
render
by
classical
tomography
.
the
patient
is
introduced
into
a
solenoid
or
between
two
helmholtz
coils
,
as
in
these
two
examples
.
they
provide
the
field
b_0
of
typically
a
few
tesla
.
additional
coils
adapted
to
the
body
region
under
examination
provide
the
magnetic
field
gradient
.
a
pulsed
radio
frequency
signal
is
then
applied
,
and
its
absorption
by
the
tissue
is
analyzed
by
fourier
analysis
.
the
height
of
the
fourier
peak
at
the
resonance
frequency
measures
the
local
density
of
the
chosen
nucleus
.
after
a
characteristic
relaxation
time
between
milliseconds
and
seconds
,
the
rf
signal
is
restored
.
the
time
delay
can
reveal
additional
tissue
properties
.
one
then
obtains
an
image
with
a
typical
resolution
of
order
millimeters
,
and
a
very
good
contrast
,
as
you
can
see
in
this
nmr
picture
of
the
knee
.
in
addition
,
the
image
shows
also
the
soft
tissue
,
difficult
to
visualize
by
classical
x-ray
tomography
.
the
mechanism
of
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
even
allows
for
a
functional
imaging
of
organs
.
this
is
due
to
the
magnetic
properties
of
hemoglobin
,
which
transport
the
oxygen
in
our
blood
.
hemoglobin
is
found
in
two
different
forms
.
the
red
blood
cells
,
which
are
oxygenized
by
the
lungs
,
contain
oxyhemoglobin
,
a
molecule
which
is
inactive
in
nmr
.
the
red
blood
cells
,
which
have
delivered
the
oxygen
to
the
tissue
,
contain
deoxyhemoglobin
,
which
is
a
paramagnetic
molecule
.
this
means
that
under
the
influence
of
the
external
magnetic
field
,
it
will
acquire
a
magnetization
,
which
is
detectable
by
nmr
.
brain
activity
,
for
example
,
causes
characteristic
dynamics
of
blood
flow
and
composition
.
in
active
brain
regions
,
where
the
neurons
are
stimulated
,
one
observes
simultaneously
a
higher
oxygen
consumption
and
a
higher
local
blood
flow
.
in
healthy
tissue
,
the
increase
in
blood
flow
is
more
important
than
the
local
consumption
of
oxygen
.
this
corresponds
to
a
relative
decrease
in
deoxyhemoglobin
,
which
can
be
used
to
localize
brain
activity
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
'll
represent
another
important
application
,
the
physical
principle
of
energy
release
in
nuclear
fission
,
which
is
currently
furnishing
about
10
%
of
the
global
energy
consumption
.
