[MUSIC].

2
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:15,099
We will quickly calculate the kinematics
for the decay of a heavy parent nucleus P,

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,974
to an alpha particle, and
a daughter nucleus D.

4
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:22,356
The conservation of energy requires that
energy gained in the form of missing mass

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,166
will be transformed into the kinetic
energy of the daughter nucleus and

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,322
the alpha particle.

7
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:31,211
The masses of the two nuclei are both
large, compared to the binding energy.

8
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:37,241
We can thus do a non-relativistic
calculation with T = 1/2 Mv^2.

9
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:42,355
For heavy nuclei, which have a much larger
mass than the alpha particle, the velocity

10
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:47,277
of the daughter nucleus will be negligible
compared to that of the alpha particle.

11
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:51,974
It is in fact reduced by

12
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:57,423
the ratio of M_alpha and M_D.

13
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:01,474
Therefore, most of the Q value is
converted into kinetic energy for

14
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:04,459
the alpha particle, and
the reaction of course,

15
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,746
only takes place when the Q
value is greater than zero.

16
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:10,718
The kinetic energy of the daughter
nucleus will be much smaller

17
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,294
than that of the alpha particle.

18
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,283
When neglecting the differences
in binding energy between nuclei,

19
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:25,564
we have an M_alpha/M_D roughly equal
to 4/(A-4).

20
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:29,457
This allows us to approximately calculate
the kinetic energy of the alpha particle

21
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,743
and the daughter nucleus.

00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:37,219
