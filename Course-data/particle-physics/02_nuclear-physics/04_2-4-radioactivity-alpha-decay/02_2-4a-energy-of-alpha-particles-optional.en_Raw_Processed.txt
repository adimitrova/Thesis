we will quickly calculate kinematics 
decay a heavy parent nucleus p,

a daughter nucleus d 
conservation energy requires that

energy daughter nucleus 
alpha particle 
masses two nuclei 
large, compared to binding energy 
we thus a nonrelativistic

heavy nuclei, a much larger

ratio malpha md 
therefore, q value is

value is greater zero 
kinetic energy daughter 
nucleus will much smaller 
that alpha particle 
neglecting differences 
in binding energy between nuclei, 
we an malphamd roughly equal
