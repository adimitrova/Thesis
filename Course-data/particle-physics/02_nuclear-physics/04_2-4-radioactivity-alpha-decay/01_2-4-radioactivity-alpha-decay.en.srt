2
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:16,160
During this second module, we deal
with nuclear physics and its application.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,670
We'll now discuss radioactivity.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,090
In this fourth video, we'll talk
about nuclear decay in general, and

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,850
the alpha decay in particular.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,644
After watching this video,

7
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:32,284
you will be able to describe the valley
of stability and its surroundings.

8
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:37,631
To know how to locate and characterize
the nuclei with respect to this valley,

9
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:41,429
and characterize alpha decays and
their properties.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,574
An unstable nucleus can transform
itself in a more stable one through

11
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,660
radioactive decay.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,778
We distinguish three types, historically
labelled as alpha, beta, and gamma decays.

13
00:00:56,778 --> 00:01:02,670
Alpha decay is the spontaneous fission of
a heavy nucleus into a less heavy one and

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,470
the nucleus of He-4,
also called alpha particle.

15
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,190
The beta decays are transformation
between a nuclear neutron into a proton,

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,414
or vice versa,
by respectively emitting an electron and

17
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:22,080
its antineutrino or
a positron and its neutrino.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,130
This way, both baryon number and
lepton number are conserved.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,850
This decay is often leave the daughter
the nucleus in an excited state,

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,810
and a gamma decays allows it to return
it to its ground state by emitting one or

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,890
more photons.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,000
Decays are a spontaneous processes.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,030
The happen if they tighten
the binding of a nucleus.

24
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,146
Thus very heavy nuclei
can reduce their mass and

25
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:56,200
increase their binding energy by emitting
a tightly-bound He-4 nucleus.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,440
Nuclei which are rich in neutrons can gain
a more symmetric state by transforming

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,370
one of them into a proton
via a ß- decay.

28
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,448
Nuclei, which are rich in protons, can
correct this asymmetry by a ß+ decay.

29
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:19,360
And excited daughter nuclei can reach
their ground state by meeting one or

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,609
more photons.

31
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:25,530
All these reactions take the nucleus
closer to the valley of stability.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,680
This table shows
the distribution of nuclei

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,398
with the stable isotopes
over the periodic system.

34
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:42,100
About 60 radioactive nuclei
are naturally present on Earth,

35
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,750
compared to about 1,000
radioactive isotopes so

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,680
far produced in the laboratory.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,350
When our planet was formed,

38
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,040
we can assume that all these nuclei
were roughly equally abundant.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,100
The absences of certain
radioactive nuclei today

40
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,280
can give us an idea of
the age of the solar system.

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,920
This estimate give us an age of
roughly 10 billion years for the Sun.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,230
All nuclei with a shorter lifetime
have completely disappeared.

43
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,330
The naturally present radioactive
nuclei have a nuclear charge, Z,

44
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,980
between 81 and 92.

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,780
They are characterized by
an excess of neutrons.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,200
Since they are heavy,
they first undergo an alpha decay,

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,000
leading to an even larger
relative excess of neutrons.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,450
This then can be fixed by
subsequent beta decay.

49
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,180
The grand daughters are often
themselves unstable and

50
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,810
undergo alpha decay and so on.

51
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,629
This results in a chain of alpha and
beta decays which will continue until

52
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,510
the valley of stability in the N-Z
plane is reached.

53
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:02,212
All of this results in four
series of alpha emitters where

54
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:07,380
the daughters progressively differ
by a multiple of four nucleons.

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,966
We have the Thorium series with
a mass number which is 4N,

56
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:18,552
the Neptunian series with mass
number A equal to 4N + 1,

57
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:22,998
the Uranium-Radium series with A equal to 4N + 2,
and

58
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:28,130
the Uranium-Actinium series
with A equal to 4N + 3.

59
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,140
One of the important applications
of radioactivity is the dating

60
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,450
of organic materials, which can
work up to several thousand years.

61
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,548
We will see this in more
detail when we speak about

62
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,779
radioisotope dating in video 2.7.

63
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:55,434
Let us now discuss the physics
of alpha decay in more detail.

64
00:04:55,434 --> 00:05:01,375
A parent nucleus, P, decays into a daughter
nucleus D via emission of a He-4 nucleus.

65
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:07,575
This corresponds to a spontaneous fission
into daughter nuclei of vary asymmetric mass,

66
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,189
since the nucleus D is much
heavier than the He-4.

67
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,794
For more details on other fission processes,
we refer you to the video 2.8.

68
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:21,750
If we consider the parent
nucleus to be at rest,

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,370
energy conservation gives us a relation
between the masses and energies.

70
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,070
Since the number of electrons
is unchanged in the reaction,

71
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,186
you can directly use atomic mass for
this calculation.

72
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:40,143
T_alpha and T_D are the kinetic
energies of the alpha particle and

73
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,809
the daughter nucleus.

74
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:47,710
The gain in binding energy that drives
the decay is called the Q value.

75
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,540
And it is converted into the kinetic
energy of the decay products.

76
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:01,100
An example of the calculation of
T_alpha and T_D is given in video 2.4a.

77
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,520
Because of the asymmetry in
the masses the alpha particle

78
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,270
takes most of the kinetic energy.

79
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,720
The spectra of alpha particles
coming from the decay

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,106
of the same isotope can reveal
intermediate metastable states.

81
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:23,426
One the observes alpha particles
with slightly different but,

82
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,881
of course, quantized energies.
One also observes gamma ray

83
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:32,780
emission which comes from the decay
cascade towards the ground state.

84
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,330
The parent nucleus can of course also
directly decay to the ground state

85
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,340
without passing by intermediate states.

86
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,145
This direct decay results in
the most energetic alpha particle.

87
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:51,247
An example is shown here for
the decay chain of Am-241,

88
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:56,000
which is a radioactive source
often used in the laboratory.

89
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,824
The kinetic energy of an alpha
particle from nuclear decay is

90
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,982
typically of the order of 5 MeV.

91
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:11,327
When such a low energy particle
approaches a heavy nucleus from outside,

92
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,530
it cannot penetrate the Coulomb barrier.

93
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:23,190
For a nucleus of mass number about 200,
it has a typical height of 20 to 25 MeV.

94
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,745
So why does the process work
in the opposite direction?

95
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:31,450
How can an alpha particle traverse
the Coulomb barrier from the inside?

96
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,660
The answer is given by
the quantum process of tunneling.

97
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,743
The probability that
an alpha particle traverses

98
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:45,708
the Coulomb barrier is of
the order of 10^-40.

99
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:50,071
But this is the probability of
traversing on a single trial.

100
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:52,800
This is why a low energy alpha particle

101
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,647
from the outside cannot
penetrate the barrier.

102
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:01,920
The velocity of an alpha particle,
bound to a nucleus with kinetic

103
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,030
energy of about 44 MeV, is not
relativistic but still impressive.

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,100
It has a velocity of about
0.15 speed of light.

105
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,490
Confined to a region with a radius of
about 10^-12 centimeters,

106
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,522
the particle bounces off the barrier
with a frequency of about

107
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:28,822
4.5 10^21 times per second.

108
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:37,240
The probability of penetration per second is thus
0.5 10^-18 per second.

109
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,577
This quantity is called
the decay constant lambda,

110
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:45,845
which is the inverse of the lifetime tau.

111
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:50,989
For a typical nucleus we find a 
lifetime of 10^10 years,

112
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,160
which is representative for
nuclei with alpha decay.

113
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,546
The number of nuclei N(t)
remaining after elapsed time t

114
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:07,580
from an initial sample of N_0 nuclei diminishes
exponentially according to the decay law.

115
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:15,920
We will give more detail on this
law in the optional video 2.5a.

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,792
In the next video, we will talk about
the other two types of radioactivity,

117
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,196
namely beta and gamma decays.
