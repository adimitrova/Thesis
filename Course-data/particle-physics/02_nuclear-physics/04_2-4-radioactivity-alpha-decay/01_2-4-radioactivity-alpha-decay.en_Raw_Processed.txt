this second module, we deal 
nuclear physics application 
well discuss radioactivity 
in this fourth video, well talk 
nuclear decay in general, 
alpha decay in particular 
watching this video, 
you will able to describe valley 
stability surroundings 
to know to locate characterize 
nuclei respect to this valley, 
characterize alpha decays 
properties 
an unstable nucleus transform 
in a stable one 
radioactive decay 
we distinguish three types, historically 
labelled alpha, beta, gamma decays 
alpha decay is spontaneous fission 
a heavy nucleus a less heavy one 
nucleus he, 
also called alpha particle 
beta decays transformation 
between a nuclear neutron a proton, 
vice versa, 
respectively emitting an electron 
antineutrino 
a positron neutrino 
this way, baryon number 
lepton number conserved 
this decay is often leave daughter 
nucleus in an excited state, 
a gamma decays allows to return 
to ground state emitting one 
photons 
decays a spontaneous processes 
happen if tighten 
binding a nucleus 
thus heavy nuclei 
reduce mass 
increase binding energy emitting 
a tightlybound nucleus 
nuclei rich in neutrons gain 
a symmetric state transforming 
one a proton 
via a decay 
nuclei, rich in protons, 
correct this asymmetry a decay 
excited daughter nuclei reach 
ground state meeting one 
photons 
reactions take nucleus 
closer to valley stability 
this table shows 
distribution nuclei 
stable isotopes 
periodic system 
radioactive nuclei 
naturally present earth, 
compared to , 
radioactive isotopes so 
far produced in laboratory 
planet formed, 
we assume that nuclei 
roughly equally abundant 
absences certain 
radioactive nuclei today 
give us an idea 
age solar system 
this estimate give us an age 
roughly billion years sun 
nuclei a shorter lifetime 
completely disappeared 
naturally present radioactive 
nuclei a nuclear charge, z, 
between 
characterized 
an excess neutrons 
since heavy, 
first undergo an alpha decay, 
leading to an even larger 
relative excess neutrons 
this fixed 
subsequent beta decay 
grand daughters often 
unstable 
undergo alpha decay so 
this results in a chain alpha 
beta decays will continue until 
valley stability in nz 
plane is reached 
this results in four 
series alpha emitters 
daughters progressively differ 
a multiple four nucleons 
we thorium series 
a mass number is n, 
neptunian series mass 
number a equal to n , 
uraniumradium series a equal to n , 

uraniumactinium series 
a equal to n 
one important applications 
radioactivity is dating 
organic materials, 
work to several thousand years 
we will see this in 
detail we speak 
radioisotope dating in video 
let us discuss physics 
alpha decay in detail 
a parent nucleus, p, decays a daughter 
nucleus d via emission a nucleus 
this corresponds to a spontaneous fission 
daughter nuclei vary asymmetric mass, 
since nucleus d is much 
heavier 
details fission processes, 
we refer you to video 
if we consider parent 
nucleus to rest, 
energy conservation gives us a relation 
between masses energies 
since number electrons 
is unchanged in reaction, 
you directly use atomic mass 
this calculation 
talpha td kinetic 
energies alpha particle 
daughter nucleus 
gain in binding energy that drives 
decay is called q value 
is converted kinetic 
energy decay products 
an example calculation 
talpha td is given in video a 
asymmetry in 
masses alpha particle 
takes kinetic energy 
spectra alpha particles 
coming decay 
isotope reveal 
intermediate metastable states 
one observes alpha particles 
slightly different but, 
course, quantized energies 
one also observes gamma ray 
emission comes decay 
cascade towards ground state 
parent nucleus course also 
directly decay to ground state 
without passing intermediate states 
this direct decay results in 
energetic alpha particle 
an example is shown here 
decay chain am, 
is a radioactive source 
often used in laboratory 
kinetic energy an alpha 
particle nuclear decay is 
typically order mev 
a low energy particle 
approaches a heavy nucleus outside, 
cannot penetrate coulomb barrier 
a nucleus mass number , 
a typical height to mev 
so process work 
in opposite direction 
an alpha particle traverse 
coulomb barrier inside 
answer is given 
quantum process tunneling 
probability that 
an alpha particle traverses 
coulomb barrier is 
order 
this is probability 
traversing a single trial 
this is a low energy alpha particle 
outside cannot 
penetrate barrier 
velocity an alpha particle, 
bound to a nucleus kinetic 
energy mev, is 
relativistic still impressive 
a velocity 
speed light 
confined to a region a radius 
centimeters, 
particle bounces barrier 
a frequency 
times per second 
probability penetration per second is thus 
per second 
this quantity is called 
decay constant lambda, 
is inverse lifetime tau 
a typical nucleus we find a 
lifetime years, 
is representative 
nuclei alpha decay 
number nuclei nt 
remaining elapsed time 
an initial sample n nuclei diminishes 
exponentially according to decay law 
we will give detail this 
law in optional video a 
in next video, we will talk 
two types radioactivity, 
namely beta gamma decays
