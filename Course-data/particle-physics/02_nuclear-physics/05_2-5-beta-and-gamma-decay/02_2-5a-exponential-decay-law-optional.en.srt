00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:14,993
In this second module, we deal with
nuclear physics and its applications and

3
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:16,888
we're discussing radioactivity.

4
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:21,086
In this video, we calculate how many
decays per second can be observed

5
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:25,731
from an initial sample of nuclei,
that is to say, we discuss the decay law.

6
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:31,310
Radioactive decay is
a statistical process.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,120
Every nucleus has the same
probability lambda

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,090
to decay in a given interval of time.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,075
This means that a constant percentage
of the nuclear existing at the time t,

10
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:46,180
N(t), will decay in
an infinitesimal elapsed time, dt.

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,280
The number of remaining nuclei then
diminishes in an exponential manner.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,160
The inverse of the decay
probability lambda

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,660
is what is called the lifetime tau = 1/lambda
of the nucleus.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,489
When one lifetime has passed, a fraction
e of the initial sample will remain.

15
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,186
One also defines the half life,T_1/2,

16
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:14,520
which is the time interval leaving
half of the initial sample.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,350
And the activity of a sample,
which is a number of decays per second.

18
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,700
It obviously depends on
the decay constant, and

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,359
the sample size which
diminishes exponentially.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,570
The natural activity of Ra-226 is

21
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,510
used as the unit of radioactivity and
it's called the Curie.

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,722
A more practical unit is the Becquerel
which corresponds to one decay per second.
