second module, we deal 
nuclear physics applications 
in this fifth video, 
we go details 
two types radioactivity, 
that is to say beta gamma decays 
goals you to able to 
characterize beta decays nuclei 
properties 
to relate properties to 
underlying weak interactions, 
to able to characterize 
gamma decays excited nuclei 
a neutronrich nucleus, ie one that 
nz larger stability 
requires transform a 
stable nucleus emitting an electron 
transforming one 
neutrons a proton 
in is called a decay 
to conserve lepton number, 
this emission must accompanied 
emission an antineutrino 
in contrary case, protonrich nuclei, 
many protons to stable, 
reach stability decay, 
accompanied neutrino emission 
since proton is 
lighter neutron, 
this latter process happen 
a bound proton q value is turned 
positive a gain in binding energy 
a nucleus a surplus 
protons also capture 
an electron internal 
kshell atomic cloud 
electrons atom will 
cascade to fill gap 
since a lepton disappears in capture 
a neutrino must emitted 
to conserve lepton number 
decays isobar, 
a 
z 
since beta decays 
three body processes, 
spectrum emitted electron 
positron is a continuous one 
shape is 
sketched in this graph 
neutrino interacts 
weakly matter 
will normally escape undetected 
this is also reason neutrino 
taken so long to discovered 
neutrinos antineutrinos fermions 
zero electric charge 
a small mass 
maximum electron energy is obtained 
neutrino is produced almost 
rest 
maximum value approaches q 
value, like would in a two body decay 
one measures this energy, 
one establish an upper limit 
neutrino mass energy conservation 
video a introduces 
exponential decay law, 
describes time evolution 
this decay processes 
quark level, beta decay proceeds 
via exchange a w boson, 
is gauge boson mediating weak 
force like is shown in this feynman graph 
large mass this 
boson is responsible 
short range weak force 
weakness low energies 
neutrinos peculiar particles 
generations mix 
mass is lightest 
among particles 
probably in order 
milli electron volt 
is even clear if neutrinos 
antineutrinos really 
different particles 
charge is same, 
magnetic dipole moment, 
contrary to neutral particles, 
like neutron example 
definitive answer will come 
experiments searching 
is called double beta decay 
deal nuclei 
two beta decays 
happen simultaneously to 
reach value stability 
if neutrino 
antineutrino really particle, 
one arrange 
lepton number one, 
that there neutrinos 
emitted in process 
if identical, 
two neutrinos must always emitted 
in process double beta decay 
recent review 
experimental situation, 
please see article rodejohann 
cited bottom this slide 
weak interactions 
two peculiarities 
first one is that lefthanded 
part quark 
lepton fields participate 
in interaction 
we mean that is that matter 
particles will spin antiparallel 
to direction motion, 
interact via weak force 
opposite is true 
matter antiparticles 
righthanded antiparticles 
spin parallel to direction 
motion interact 
neutrinos type quarks, 
that is second peculiarity, 
participate in weakened directions, 
mixtures corresponding real particles 
one denotes neutrino 
mixtures nue, nu, 
nutau according to generation 
mixtures real particles nul, 
num nuh we 
introduced in first module 
quark mixtures denoted d, 
b 
three generations, mixtures 
real particles d, s, b 
we will come back to astonishing 
properties in module 
we discuss weak interactions 
in detail 
i mean participating in weak 
interactions is that left handed 
mixtures able to emit 
absorb weak bosons 
i mean real particles quantum 
eigenstates mass operator 
states propagate 
a specific velocity 
energymomentum is known 
this is case nue 
d example 
is nul d quark 
a mass is a constant motion 
let us come to last type 
radioactivity, gamma decays 
often follow another previous 
decay leaves daughter 
nucleus in an excited state 
fall back ground 
state emitting a photon 
a quantized energy 
energy photon will 
correspond to energy difference 
between excited ground state 
study emission 
absorption nuclear gamma rays thus 
constitutes nuclear spectroscopy in 
an analogy to atomic spectroscopy 
one remarkable difference, 
one cannot neglect recoil 
daughter nucleus in gamma decays 
massive system, less 
important will recoil energy 
one freeze nucleus a 
crystal structure a much larger 
mass allows recoil to 
reduce to almost nothing 
this is called mssbauer effect, 
allows to reduce line width 
a gamma decays to order ev, 
in turn allows to measure 
relative line separation 
to an accuracy to order 

one thus study nuclear energy 
levels great precision 
this also used to measure 
composition materials 
we show here an example gamma 
spectrum natural uranium mineral 
allows to identify 
quantify presence 
radionuclides like ra, pb 
bi coming 
decay change u, 
is a gamma emitter 
in next video, we invited to 
visit laboratory nuclear 
physics course university 
geneva to see experiments radioactivity
