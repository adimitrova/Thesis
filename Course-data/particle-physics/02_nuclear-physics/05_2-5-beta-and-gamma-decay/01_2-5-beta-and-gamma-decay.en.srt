2
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:15,215
During the second module, we deal with
nuclear physics and its applications.

3
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,805
And in this fifth video,
we go into more details

4
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:24,495
on the two other types of radioactivity,
that is to say beta and gamma decays.

5
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:28,635
The goals for you are to be able to
characterize beta decays of nuclei and

6
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,795
their properties.

7
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:35,793
To relate these properties to those
of the underlying weak interactions,

8
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:40,016
and to be able to characterize
gamma decays of excited nuclei.

9
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:48,175
A neutron-rich nucleus, i.e. one that has
N/Z larger than what stability

10
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:54,830
requires can transform into a more
stable nucleus by emitting an electron

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,470
and transforming one of
its neutrons into a proton

12
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,330
in what is called a ß- decay.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,070
To conserve lepton number,

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,130
this emission must be accompanied by
the emission of an anti-neutrino.

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,760
In the contrary case, proton-rich nuclei,
which have too many protons to be stable,

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,760
can reach stability by ß+ decay,
accompanied by neutrino emission.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,220
Since the proton is
lighter than the neutron,

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,160
this latter process can only happen for

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,070
a bound proton where the Q value is turned
positive by a gain in binding energy.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,530
A nucleus with a surplus
of protons can also capture

21
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,240
an electron from the internal
K-shell of the atomic cloud.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,220
The other electrons of the atom will
then cascade down to fill the gap.

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,240
Since a lepton disappears in the capture

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
a neutrino must be emitted
to conserve lepton number.

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,030
All these decays are isobar,
they have ∆A = 0 and

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,084
∆Z = ±1.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,980
Since beta decays are
three body processes,

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,520
the spectrum of the emitted electron
or positron is a continuous one.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,610
It has the shape which is
sketched in this graph.

30
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,390
The neutrino interacts only
very weakly with matter.

31
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,600
It will normally escape undetected.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,148
This is also the reason why the neutrino
has taken so long to be discovered.

33
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:21,150
Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are fermions
with zero electric charge and

34
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,910
a very small mass.

35
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,140
The maximum electron energy is obtained
when the neutrino is produced almost

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,730
at rest.

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,710
Its maximum value then approaches the Q
value, like it would in a two body decay.

38
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,190
When one measures this energy,

39
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,448
one can establish an upper limit on
the neutrino mass by energy conservation.

40
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:47,454
The video 2.5a introduces
the exponential decay law,

41
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:52,371
which describes the time evolution
of this and other decay processes.

42
00:02:55,715 --> 00:03:02,115
At the quark level, beta decay proceeds
via the exchange of a W boson, which

43
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:08,818
is the gauge boson mediating the weak
force like it is shown in this Feynman graph.

44
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,783
The large mass of this
boson is responsible for

45
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:16,129
the short range of the weak force and
its weakness at low energies.

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,910
Neutrinos are very peculiar particles.
Their generations can mix with each other.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,950
Their mass is the lightest
among all particles and

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,210
probably in the order of
milli electron volt.

49
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,325
It is not even clear if neutrinos and

50
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,090
anti-neutrinos are really
different particles.

51
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,728
Their charge is the same, and
they have no magnetic dipole moment,

52
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,532
contrary to other neutral particles,
like the neutron for example.

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,220
The definitive answer will come
from experiments searching for

54
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,650
what is called double beta decay.

55
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,520
They deal with nuclei
where two beta decays

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,960
happen simultaneously to
reach the value of stability.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,040
If neutrino and
antineutrino are really the same particle,

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
one of them can then arrange
the lepton number of the other one,

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,120
such that there are no neutrinos
emitted in the process at all.

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,860
If they are not identical,

61
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,600
two neutrinos must always be emitted
in the process of double beta decay.

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,241
For recent review of
the experimental situation,

63
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:20,222
please see the article by Rodejohann
cited on the bottom of this slide.

64
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:26,600
Weak interactions have
two more peculiarities.

65
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,220
The first one is that only the left-handed 
part of the quark and

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,800
lepton fields participate
in the interaction.

67
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,110
What we mean by that is that only matter
particles will spin anti-parallel

68
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,070
to the direction of motion,
interact via the weak force.

69
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,476
The opposite is true for
matter anti-particles.

70
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:51,860
Only right-handed anti-particles which
have the spin parallel to the direction of

71
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,670
motion can interact.

72
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,000
Neutrinos and down type quarks, and
that is the second peculiarity,

73
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,460
which participate in weakened directions,
are mixtures of the corresponding real particles.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,850
One denotes the neutrino
mixtures of nu_e, nu_µ,

75
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,290
and nu_tau according to their generation.

76
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,930
They are mixtures of the real particles nu_L,

77
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,340
nu_M and nu_H which we have
introduced in the first module.

78
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,690
The quark mixtures are denoted by d’,
s’ and b’ for

79
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,270
the three generations, mixtures of
the real particles d, s, and b.

80
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,450
We will come back to these astonishing
properties in module 6 when

81
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,690
we discuss weak interactions
in more detail.

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,450
What I mean by participating in weak
interactions is that only the left handed

83
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,160
mixtures are able to emit or
absorb weak bosons.

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,140
What I mean by real particles are quantum
eigenstates of the mass operator.

85
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,350
These states propagate
with a specific velocity

86
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,919
when their energy-momentum is known.

87
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,685
This is not the case for nu_e or
for the d’ for example.

88
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:07,280
It is the nu_L and the d quark which have
a mass which is a constant of motion.

89
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,390
Let us now come to the last type of
radioactivity, the gamma decays.

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,130
They often follow another previous
decay which leaves the daughter

91
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,330
nucleus in an excited state.

92
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,710
It can then fall back into its ground
state by emitting a photon of

93
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,520
a quantized energy.

94
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,470
The energy of the photon will
correspond to the energy difference

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,280
between the excited and the ground state.

96
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,400
The study of emission and
absorption of nuclear gamma rays thus

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,470
constitutes nuclear spectroscopy in
an analogy to atomic spectroscopy.

98
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,790
With one remarkable difference,

99
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,240
one cannot neglect the recoil of
the daughter nucleus in gamma decays.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,070
The more massive the system, the less
important will be the recoil energy.

101
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,180
One can just freeze the nucleus into a
crystal structure which has a much larger

102
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,230
mass and allows the recoil to
be reduce to almost nothing.

103
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,640
This is called the Mössbauer effect,
it allows to reduce the line width of

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,800
a gamma decays to of the order of 10^-7 eV,

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
which in turn allows to measure
the relative line separation

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,340
to an accuracy to the order
of 10^-12.

107
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,710
One can thus study nuclear energy
levels with great precision.

108
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,430
This can also be used to measure
the composition of materials.

109
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,370
We show here an example of the gamma
spectrum of natural uranium mineral.

110
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,770
It allows to identify and
quantify the presence of

111
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,603
radionuclides like Ra-226, Pb-214.

112
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:48,536
and Bi-214 coming from
the decay change of U-238,

113
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:52,220
which itself is not a gamma emitter.

114
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,518
In the next video, we are invited to
visit the laboratory of the nuclear

115
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,186
physics course at University of
Geneva to see experiments on radioactivity.
