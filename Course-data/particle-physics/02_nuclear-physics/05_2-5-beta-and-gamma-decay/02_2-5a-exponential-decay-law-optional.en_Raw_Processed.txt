music 
in this second module, we deal 
nuclear physics applications 
discussing radioactivity 
in this video, we calculate many 
decays per second observed 
an initial sample nuclei, 
that is to say, we discuss decay law 
radioactive decay is 
a statistical process 
every nucleus 
probability lambda 
to decay in a given interval time 
this means that a constant percentage 
nuclear existing time t, 
nt, will decay in 
an infinitesimal elapsed time, dt 
number remaining nuclei 
diminishes in an exponential manner 
inverse decay 
probability lambda 
is is called lifetime tau lambda 
nucleus 
one lifetime passed, a fraction 
e initial sample will remain 
one also defines half life,t, 
is time interval leaving 
half initial sample 
activity a sample, 
is a number decays per second 
obviously depends 
decay constant, 
sample size 
diminishes exponentially 
natural activity ra is 
used unit radioactivity 
called curie 
a practical unit is becquerel 
corresponds to one decay per second
