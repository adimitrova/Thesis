hello, welcome to second module 
introductory course subatomic physics 
this module, well deal 
nuclear physics applications 
end module, 
we will visit tokamak swiss 
institute technology in lausanne 
beznau nuclear power plant 
is oldest one still in operation 
this is pretty much 
a selfcontained module, 
if main interest is nuclear physics, 
you will wellserved 
you will also notice that is 
somewhat longer modules, so 
take time to digest 
contents without pressure 
in this first video, we will review 
is known mass nuclei 
goals you following 
to know nomenclature atomic 
nuclei periodic system 
to able to qualitatively describe 
mass binding energy nuclei 
experiments rutherford type 
demonstrate existence a positively 
charged nucleus, 
is four orders magnitude 
smaller size atom 
experiments require 
to understand electromagnetic 
interactions between project 
target 
scattering experiments also yield 
information nuclear properties 
thus establish a catalog 
properties nuclear interaction 
that holds together protons 
neutrons inside nucleus 
one must confuse this nuclear force 
strong force introduced in 
first module extensively 
discussed in module number five 
strong force binds together quarks 
inside hadrons gluon exchange 
permit quarks 
to leave hadrons 
so hadrons in general 
nucleons in particular, 
carry a net color charge 
thus gluons cannot bind protons 
neutrons to form a nucleus 
nuclear force is like a long 
distance residue strong force 
in that resembles wellknown 
van der waals force, 
is a residue electromagnetic 
interaction acts between 
electrically neutral molecules 
let us compare basic properties 
atoms, electromagnetic force 
one side, to nuclei, 
nuclear force side 
electromagnetic force is 
responsible holding atoms together 
properties well known, 
classically, 
rather easy to extrapolate 
to quantum distances 
study atomic spectra indeed 
gave rise to quantum mechanics, 
qualitatively 
quantitatively explains many phenomena 
condensed matter physics 
fine structure constant, 
electromagnetic coupling 
constant, is a small number 
alpha is , makes 
perturbative calculations feasible 
nuclear force, hand, 
must much stronger, 
since wins coulomb repulsion 
between tightlypacked protons 
must short range, 
since doesnt make 
felt outside nuclear volume 
classical analog 
experimental results help 
to understand properties 
one thus uses experiments 
a guide towards empirical models 
nucleus nuclear force 
we will come back to relation between 
experiments models we go along 
let us first summarize we identify 
denote nuclei 
we denote z, nuclear charge, 
is equal to atomic 
number in periodic table 
itis given number 
protons in nucleus 
a is number nucleons, 
sum protons neutrons, 
is also called mass number 
nuclei thus completely identified 
electric charge 
number nucleons 
name we give identifies z 
usually is supplemented a 
we say carbon , 
that means a nucleus z a 
evidently, number neutrons is 
difference between mass number 
atomic number, is denoted n 
chemical properties elements 
determined electron 
cloud surrounding nucleus 
periodic table is thus 
organized according to z 
nuclei number protons, 

a different number neutrons, 
called isotopes 
similar 
chemical properties 
necessarily similar 
nuclear properties 
examples uranium 
uranium , protons, 
a different number neutrons 
thus different stability properties 
another example is hydrogen, 
deuterium, 
tritium one proton 
zero, one, two neutrons 
nuclei also 
excited to higher states, 
keeping number protons 
neutrons constant 
called resonances isomers 
nuclei 
number nucleons 
different number 
protons called isobars 
roughly nuclear mass 
examples carbon boron , 
nucleons 
naively one might assume that mass 
nuclei is simply given sum 
masses protons 
neutrons contain 
in reality, this mass is, 
course, diminished binding 
energy between nucleons 
mass deficit m 
must always negative so 
that nucleus is in a bound state 
we call binding energy 
measured 
practically nuclei 
absolute value binding energy 
is energy required to decompose 
nucleus separate nucleons 
binding energy per nucleon, 
ma, 
is energy required to separate 
average nucleon nucleus 
is much smaller 
mass a nucleon p n 
mass nucleus is thus indeed 
dominated mass constituents 
nucleons 
situation is different 
total mass quarks inside 
nucleon is around 
nucleon mass 
is binding energy 
dominates nucleon mass 
one analyzes dependance 
binding energy, m per nucleon a, 
mass number a one 
notices following 
a less 
left side this graph, 
ma oscillates 
rises rapidly increasing a 
a between , ma saturates 
a , a broad maximum 
that is, iron group formed nickel, 
iron, 
cobalt mev 
per nucleon binding energy 
a larger , binding 
energy per nucleon decreases slowly 
general mean is mev per nucleon 
kinetic energy nucleons inside 
nucleus must thus relatively small 
otherwise, would stay bound 
velocities bound nucleons 
thus nonrelativistic 
binding energy corresponds indeed to a 
wavelength nucleons inside nucleus 
this wavelength is less two fermi 
order nucleus size 
is thus plausible that nucleus 
contain nucleons maximum kinetic 
energy mev 
a maximum momentum 
if, hand, 
nucleus would contain electrons, 
would relativistic 
wavelength would 
x centimeters, 
much bigger nucleus size 
nucleus thus 
contain bound electrons 
need a much larger 
volume to contained 
this is obviously in agreement 
findings geiger marsden, 
that we discussed 
in previous module 
in next video, we will talk 
size spin nuclei
