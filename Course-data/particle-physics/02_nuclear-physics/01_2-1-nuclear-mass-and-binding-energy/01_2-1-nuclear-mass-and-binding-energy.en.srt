2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,345
Hello, welcome to the second module of our
introductory course on Subatomic Physics.

3
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:22,310
During this module, we'll deal with
nuclear physics and its applications.

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,642
At the end of the module,

5
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:27,718
we will visit the Tokamak of the Swiss
Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

6
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:34,055
And the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant which
is the oldest one still in operation.

7
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:36,543
This is pretty much
a self-contained module,

8
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:40,225
if your main interest is nuclear physics,
you will be well-served.

9
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:44,979
You will also notice that it is
somewhat longer than other modules, so

10
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,180
just take your time to digest
the contents without pressure.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,040
In this first video, we will review
what is known about the mass of nuclei.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,040
The goals for you are the following.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,345
To know the nomenclature of atomic
nuclei and their periodic system.

14
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:06,710
And to be able to qualitatively describe
the mass and binding energy of nuclei.

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,860
Experiments of the Rutherford type
demonstrate the existence of a positively

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,290
charged nucleus,

17
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,190
which is four orders of magnitude
smaller than the size of the atom.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,130
These experiments only require
to understand electromagnetic

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,440
interactions between the project and
the target.

20
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:30,650
Scattering experiments can also yield
information about nuclear properties.

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,550
And thus establish a catalog of
the properties of the nuclear interaction

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,430
that holds together protons and
neutrons inside the nucleus.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,390
One must not confuse this nuclear force
with the strong force introduced in

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,890
the first module and more extensively
discussed in module number five.

25
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,960
The strong force binds together quarks
inside hadrons by gluon exchange.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,750
It does not permit quarks
to leave the hadrons.

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,960
So hadrons in general and

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,540
nucleons in particular,
do not carry a net color charge.

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,330
Thus gluons cannot bind protons and
neutrons to form a nucleus.

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,830
The nuclear force is more like a long
distance residue of the strong force

31
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,970
in that it resembles the well-known
Van der Waals force,

32
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,050
which is a residue of the electromagnetic
interaction which acts between

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,980
electrically neutral molecules.

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,010
Let us compare some basic properties of
atoms, and the electromagnetic force on

35
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,090
one side, to nuclei, and
the nuclear force on the other side.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,750
The electromagnetic force is
responsible for holding atoms together.

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,470
Its properties are well known,
classically, and

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,120
rather easy to extrapolate
to quantum distances.

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,342
The study of atomic spectra indeed
gave rise to quantum mechanics,

40
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,723
which qualitatively and

41
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:53,740
quantitatively explains many phenomena
of condensed matter physics.

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,980
The fine structure constant,

43
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,210
the electromagnetic coupling
constant, is a small number.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,340
Alpha is about 1/137, which makes
perturbative calculations feasible.

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,190
The nuclear force, on the other hand,
must be much stronger,

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,300
since it wins over the Coulomb repulsion
between tightly-packed protons.

47
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,350
It must be of short range,

48
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,240
since it doesn't make itself
felt outside the nuclear volume.

49
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,300
It has no classical analog.

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Only experimental results can help
to understand its properties.

51
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,130
One thus uses experiments as
a guide towards empirical models

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,640
of the nucleus and of the nuclear force.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,030
We will come back to the relation between
experiments and models as we go along.

54
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:46,110
Let us first summarize how we identify and
denote nuclei.

55
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,330
We denote by Z, the nuclear charge,

56
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,340
which is equal to the atomic
number in the periodic table.

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,825
Itis given by the number
of protons in the nucleus.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,212
A is the number of nucleons,
the sum of protons and neutrons,

59
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,970
it is also called the mass number.

60
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,760
Nuclei are thus completely identified
by their electric charge and

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,860
the number of nucleons.

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,235
The name we give them identifies Z and
usually is supplemented by A.

63
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:15,107
When we say carbon 14,

64
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:19,664
that means a nucleus with Z=6 and A=14.

65
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,030
Evidently, the number of neutrons is then
the difference between the mass number and

66
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,360
the atomic number, and is denoted by N.

67
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,800
The chemical properties of the elements
are determined by the electron

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,540
cloud surrounding the nucleus.

69
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,499
The periodic table is thus
organized according to Z.

70
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,160
Nuclei with the same number of protons,
but

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,900
with a different number of neutrons,
are called isotopes.

72
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,580
They have very similar
chemical properties but

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,110
not necessarily similar
nuclear properties.

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,670
Examples are uranium 235 and
uranium 238, which have both 92 protons,

75
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,110
but a different number of neutrons and
thus different stability properties.

76
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,030
Another example is hydrogen,
deuterium, and

77
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,310
tritium which all have one proton and
zero, one, or two neutrons.

78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,080
Nuclei can also be
excited to higher states,

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,590
keeping the number of protons and
neutrons constant.

80
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,874
These are called resonances or isomers.

81
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,455
Nuclei with the same
number of nucleons but

82
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:27,607
the different number of
protons are called isobars.

83
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:31,850
They have roughly the same nuclear mass.

84
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,680
Examples are carbon 12 and boron 12,
with both have 12 nucleons.

85
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:44,610
Naively one might assume that the mass
of nuclei is simply given by the sum of

86
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,500
the masses of protons and
neutrons they contain.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,630
But in reality, this mass is,

88
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,050
of course, diminished by the binding
energy between the nucleons.

89
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,950
The mass deficit ∆M
must always be negative so

90
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,330
that the nucleus is in a bound state.

91
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,400
We call it the binding energy.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,390
It has been measured for
practically all nuclei.

93
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,610
The absolute value of the binding energy
is the energy required to decompose

94
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,130
the nucleus into separate nucleons.

95
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,730
The binding energy per nucleon,
∆M/A,

96
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,040
is the energy required to separate
the average nucleon from its nucleus.

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,832
It is much smaller than
the mass of a nucleon p and n.

98
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:29,010
The mass of the nucleus is thus indeed
dominated by the mass of its constituents.

99
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,791
For the nucleons themselves
the situation is very different.

100
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,750
The total mass of the quarks inside
the nucleon is only around 1% of

101
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,867
the nucleon mass.

102
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,910
It is their binding energy which
dominates the nucleon mass.

103
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,100
When one analyzes the dependance of
the binding energy, ∆M per nucleon A,

104
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,560
on the mass number A one
notices the following.

105
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,660
For A less than 20 on
the left side of this graph,

106
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,360
∆M/A oscillates but
rises rapidly with increasing A.

107
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,920
For A between 20 and 60, ∆M/A saturates.

108
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,820
For A about 60, it has a broad maximum.

109
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,400
That is, the iron group formed by nickel,
iron, and

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,400
cobalt with about 9 MeV
per nucleon of binding energy.

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,410
And then for A larger than 60, the binding
energy per nucleon decreases slowly.

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,830
The general mean is about 8 MeV per nucleon.

113
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,210
The kinetic energy of nucleons inside
the nucleus must thus be relatively small.

114
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,400
Otherwise, they would not stay bound.

115
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,504
The velocities of bound nucleons
are thus non-relativistic.

116
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,130
The binding energy corresponds indeed to a
wavelength of nucleons inside the nucleus.

117
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:01,298
This wavelength is less than two Fermi of
the order of the nucleus' size itself.

118
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:05,350
It is thus plausible that the nucleus can
contain nucleons with the maximum kinetic

119
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,870
energy of about 8 MeV.

120
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,290
Or a maximum momentum of about 120 Me.

121
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,000
If, on the other hand,
the nucleus would contain electrons,

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,365
they would be relativistic and
their wavelength would be

123
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:24,780
2.5 x 10^-12 centimeters,
much bigger than the nucleus size.

124
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,130
The nucleus can thus not
contain bound electrons.

125
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,310
They need a much larger
volume to be contained.

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,190
This is obviously in agreement with
the findings of Geiger and Marsden,

127
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,870
that we have discussed
in the previous module.

128
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,063
In the next video, we will talk about
the size and the spin of nuclei.

129
