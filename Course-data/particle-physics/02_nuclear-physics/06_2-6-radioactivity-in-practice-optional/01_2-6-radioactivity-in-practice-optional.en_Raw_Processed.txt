in this video, 
well introduce you to handling radioactive sources type , 
, radiation protection measures 
to protect 
people handle sources environment 
let present dr alessandro bravar, is senior lecturer 
in particle physics department, 
directs nuclear physics 
lab course students 
dr bravar is an active member neutrinos research group 
in department, prepares 
an experiment muon physics 
paul scherrer institute in villigen, near zurich 
alessandro, you explain to us 
rules game are, handling radioactive sources 
first, in this laboratory, we using several radioactive sources 
in general, stored in a safe, to block 
radiation, also to restrict 
access to sources we cannot allow anyone to use 
radioactive sources, unless adequate preparation 
so, i will take radioactive sources, 
a source, a source, we will see protected, 
stored, also we measure 
radiation coming out, shielding without shielding 
good 
so lets go 
bip bip so, first thing, i open safe 
this is a first source, a source, 
here we a source, 
ill show you an old watch, 
one used radium to make needles visible 
audio 
so, thats three sources, you see there 
source, sr, 
you see a source, cs, 
an old alarm clock that incorporates a very, weak source radium 
so, alessandro, you explain sources 
packaged like this students 
protected excessive radiation 
okay so i begin first source, 
a source, emits electrons 
so sources we use here sealed sources 
that is to say that there is a small layer protection around source to avoid 
physical contact thus contamination 
protective layer is sufficient to block 
radiations 
depending type radiation, different materials also 
materials different thickness used to block radiation 
in this case, there is a source so emits electrons 
to stop electrons, one needs cm plastic, 
therefore, source is contained in this plastic object 
here, if you look, you see silvery part, 
is radioactive part that emits electrons 
to show that source is well shielded, 
you use a geiger counter to measure radiation level 
so i turn counter, we see, 
there many counts coming source 
contrary, if i remove protection 
i said, cm plastic, placing counter source, we see 
compteur sur la source et voit que 
that count rate goes a lot, say several thousand hits per second 
so i put cap back we see that there is 
radiation source 
second source i will show you is a source, 
gammas photons a certain energy, 
rather high energy compared to visible light photons 
to protect photon sources, 
one needs a lead shielding 
to stop photons, 
takes a rather heavy material a rather high z, lead 
here is lead container, inside 
we a second lead container, source is hidden inside 
to remove source, i use a pair tweezers, 
i touch source fingersinside there is 
this little piece lead, contains source in tip 
so if i place a geiger counter in front source, 
we see that count rate is quite high 
contrary, if i put source in containers 
almost radiation comes 
so to protect a source type, one choose good material, 
also a thickness shielding according to intensity source 
source intense, lead 
i need to stop photons emerging source 
in fact, we a little calculation absorption photons 
in minimum cross section, in a previous video 
in old times, in s, 
everyone much relaxed 
respect to radioactive sources, right 
one even put objects every day use 
you explain purpose radioactive source in this clock 
this is an old alarm clock, 
to make hands visible night, 
used radium to make phosphorescent 
today, we use different materials, phosphorus, 
in past, people used radium, this is a very, dangerous substance 
reason radium 
is so dangerous is that decyas radon 
radon is a radioactive element, is a gas, 
is everywhere in nature, we breathe radon 
breathing air one also takes in a portion 
radon in lungs, radon decays emitting 
alpha particles, come in direct contact tissues 
body much damage 
in fact, radon is one concerns we around world, 
in homes, also in switzerlandthere regions in switzerland, especially alps 
jura, there rocks outgassing a lot radon, while 
in big cities, like in geneva zurich etc, there is much radon 
that is to say that one spend night in a basement in alps 
in a basement in alps 
exactly houses must properly ventilated 
and, thats we banned use radium since a long time 
to show effect, although there is a minimum amount radium, 
deposited clock, geiger counter, 
i used before, one reach a certain number counts, tells us 
that there is a lot radium decays this clock 
so a good idea to sleep a clock bedside 
thats why, we long since banned 
using radium in clocks 
thank you much
