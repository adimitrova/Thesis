00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:11,602
>> In this video, 

3
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:18,300
we'll introduce you to the handling of radioactive sources of type α,

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,100
β and γ, and radiation protection measures 

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,230
to protect both 

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,220
the people who handle sources and the environment.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,090
Let me present Dr. Alessandro Bravar, who is senior lecturer 

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,750
in our particle physics department,

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,100
and who directs the nuclear physics

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,730
lab course for our students.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Dr. Bravar is an active member of the neutrinos research group

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,170
in our department, and he prepares

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,560
an experiment on muon physics

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,768
at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, near Zurich.

15
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:14,510
Alessandro, can you explain to us 

16
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,140
what the rules of the game are, when handling radioactive sources?

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,700
>> First, in this laboratory, we are using several radioactive sources.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,060
In general, they are stored in a safe, to block

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,080
all the radiation, and also to restrict

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,030
access to the sources because we cannot allow anyone to use 

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,160
radioactive sources, unless they have had adequate preparation.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,810
So, I will take out some radioactive sources, 

23
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,700
a β source, and a γ source, and we will see how they are protected,

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,960
how they are stored, and also how we measure

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,930
the radiation coming out, with shielding and without shielding.

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,670
>> Very good.

27
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,785
So let's go!

28
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:15,690
[BIP] [BIP] So, first thing, I open the safe. 

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,168
This is a first source, a β source, 

30
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,180
here we have a γ source,

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,820
and as I'll show you an old watch,

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,625
where one used radium to make the needles visible.

33
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:42,464
[NO AUDIO]

34
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,780
>> So, that's three sources, you see there 

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,570
β- source, 90Sr, 

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,610
you see a γ source, 137Cs, and 

37
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,760
an old alarm clock that incorporates a very, very weak source of radium.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,040
>> So, Alessandro, can you explain why the sources are 

39
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,470
packaged like this and how students

40
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,210
are protected from excessive radiation? 

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,905
>> Okay. So I begin with the first source, 

42
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:24,935
it's a β- source, which emits electrons.

43
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:29,330
So all the sources we use here are sealed sources. 

44
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,655
That is to say that there is a small layer of protection around the source to avoid

45
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,655
physical contact and thus contamination.

46
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:40,145
But the protective layer is not sufficient to block

47
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,665
all radiations.

48
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:46,875
Depending on the type of radiation, different materials and also

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,725
materials of different thickness are used to block the radiation. 

50
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:55,225
In this case, there is a β- source so it emits electrons.

51
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:59,275
To stop the electrons, one needs about 2cm of plastic,

52
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:05,870
and therefore, the source is contained in this plastic object. 

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,180
Here, if you look, you can see the silvery part,

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,390
it is the radioactive part that emits electrons.

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,420
To show that the source is well shielded, 

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,330
you can use a Geiger counter to measure the radiation level.

57
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,510
So I turn on the counter, and as we see,

58
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,080
there are not many counts coming from the source.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
On the contrary, if I remove the protection

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,005
(as I said, 2cm of plastic), and placing the counter on the source, we see
compteur sur la source et on voit que on

61
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:46,795
that the count rate goes up a lot, say several thousand hits per second.

62
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:50,785
So I put the cap back on and we see that there is no more 

63
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:54,145
radiation from the source.

64
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:59,315
The second source I will show you is a γ source, 

65
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:03,600
gammas are photons of a certain energy,

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,250
rather high energy compared to visible light photons.

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,670
To protect photon sources, 

68
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,880
one needs a lead shielding.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,000
To stop the photons, 

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,700
it takes a rather heavy material with a rather high Z, such as lead.

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,940
Here is the lead container, inside

72
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,570
we have a second lead container, the source is hidden inside.

73
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,420
To remove the source, I use a pair of tweezers,

74
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,260
I do not touch the source with my fingers.Inside there is

75
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,270
this little piece of lead, which contains the source in its tip.

76
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,070
So if I place a Geiger counter just in front of the source, 

77
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,800
we see that the count rate is quite high.

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,265
On the contrary, if I put the source in its containers

79
00:05:55,265 --> 00:06:01,590
almost no radiation comes out. 

80
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,260
So to protect from a source of γ-type, one does not just choose the good material,

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,440
but also a thickness of the shielding according to the intensity of the source. 

82
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,790
The more the source intense, the more lead 

83
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,930
I need to stop all photons emerging from the source.

84
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,180
>> In fact, we did a little calculation of the absorption of photons

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,422
in the minimum of their cross section, in a previous video.

86
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:35,260
In the old times, in the 1950s,

87
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,200
everyone was much more relaxed 

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,390
with respect to radioactive sources, right?

89
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,770
One even put them into objects of every day use.

90
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,080
Can you explain what was the purpose of the radioactive source in this clock?

91
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,210
>> This is an old alarm clock, 

92
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,380
and to make the hands visible during the night,

93
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,280
they used radium to make them phosphorescent.

94
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,920
Today, we use different materials, such as phosphorus,

95
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,090
but in the past, people used radium, and this is a very, very dangerous substance.

96
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,190
The reason why the radium 

97
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,290
is so dangerous is that it decyas into radon.

98
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,160
Radon is a radioactive element, it is a gas,

99
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,390
which is everywhere in nature, and we can breathe radon.

100
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,350
Breathing air one also takes in a portion 

101
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,200
of radon in our lungs, where radon decays by emitting

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,635
alpha particles, which come in direct contact with the tissues

103
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,305
of our body and can do much damage.

104
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:48,665
In fact, radon is one of the concerns we have around the world, 

105
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:53,385
in homes, also in Switzerland.There are regions in Switzerland, especially the Alps

106
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:57,385
and the Jura, where there are rocks outgassing a lot of radon, while

107
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:01,155
in big cities, like in Geneva or Zurich etc., there is not much radon. 

108
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:05,855
>> That is to say that one should not spend the night in a basement in the Alps.

109
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,340
in a basement in the Alps.

110
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,020
>> Exactly. Houses must be properly ventilated. 

111
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,220
>> And, that's why we have banned the use of radium since a long time.

112
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,520
To show the effect, although there is a minimum amount of radium,

113
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,520
which has been deposited on the clock, with the same Geiger counter,

114
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,990
which I used before, one can reach a certain number of counts, which tells us

115
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,300
that there is a lot of radium decays from this clock

116
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,720
And so it's not a good idea to sleep with such a clock by the bedside. 

117
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,240
>> And that's why, we have long since banned

118
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
using radium in clocks. 

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,655
Thank you very much.
