in
this
video
,
we
'll
introduce
you
to
the
handling
of
radioactive
sources
of
type
Ã®Â±
,
Ã®Â³
and
Ã®Â³
,
and
radiation
protection
measures
to
protect
both
the
people
who
handle
sources
and
the
environment
.
let
me
present
dr.
alessandro
bravar
,
who
is
senior
lecturer
in
our
particle
physics
department
,
and
who
directs
the
nuclear
physics
lab
course
for
our
students
.
dr.
bravar
is
an
active
member
of
the
neutrinos
research
group
in
our
department
,
and
he
prepares
an
experiment
on
muon
physics
at
the
paul
scherrer
institute
in
villigen
,
near
zurich
.
alessandro
,
can
you
explain
to
us
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are
,
when
handling
radioactive
sources
?
>
>
first
,
in
this
laboratory
,
we
are
using
several
radioactive
sources
.
in
general
,
they
are
stored
in
a
safe
,
to
block
all
the
radiation
,
and
also
to
restrict
access
to
the
sources
because
we
can
not
allow
anyone
to
use
radioactive
sources
,
unless
they
have
had
adequate
preparation
.
so
,
i
will
take
out
some
radioactive
sources
,
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
and
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
and
we
will
see
how
they
are
protected
,
how
they
are
stored
,
and
also
how
we
measure
the
radiation
coming
out
,
with
shielding
and
without
shielding
.

very
good
.
so
let
's
go
!

[

so
,
first
thing
,
i
open
the
safe
.
this
is
a
first
source
,
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
here
we
have
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
and
as
i
'll
show
you
an
old
watch
,
where
one
used
radium
to
make
the
needles
visible
.

so
,
that
's
three
sources
,
you
see
there
Ã®Â³-
source
,
90sr
,
you
see
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
137cs
,
and
an
old
alarm
clock
that
incorporates
a
very
,
very
weak
source
of
radium
.
>
>
so
,
alessandro
,
can
you
explain
why
the
sources
are
packaged
like
this
and
how
students
are
protected
from
excessive
radiation
?
>
>
okay
.
so
i
begin
with
the
first
source
,
it
's
a
Ã®Â³-
source
,
which
emits
electrons
.
so
all
the
sources
we
use
here
are
sealed
sources
.
that
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
small
layer
of
protection
around
the
source
to
avoid
physical
contact
and
thus
contamination
.
but
the
protective
layer
is
not
sufficient
to
block
all
radiations
.
depending
on
the
type
of
radiation
,
different
materials
and
also
materials
of
different
thickness
are
used
to
block
the
radiation
.
in
this
case
,
there
is
a
Ã®Â³-
source
so
it
emits
electrons
.
to
stop
the
electrons
,
one
needs
about
2cm
of
plastic
,
and
therefore
,
the
source
is
contained
in
this
plastic
object
.
here
,
if
you
look
,
you
can
see
the
silvery
part
,
it
is
the
radioactive
part
that
emits
electrons
.
to
show
that
the
source
is
well
shielded
,
you
can
use
a
geiger
counter
to
measure
the
radiation
level
.
so
i
turn
on
the
counter
,
and
as
we
see
,
there
are
not
many
counts
coming
from
the
source
.
on
the
contrary
,
if
i
remove
the
protection
(
as
i
said
,
2cm
of
plastic
)
,
and
placing
the
counter
on
the
source
,
we
see
compteur
sur
la
source
et
on
voit
que
on
that
the
count
rate
goes
up
a
lot
,
say
several
thousand
hits
per
second
.
so
i
put
the
cap
back
on
and
we
see
that
there
is
no
more
radiation
from
the
source
.
the
second
source
i
will
show
you
is
a
Ã®Â³
source
,
gammas
are
photons
of
a
certain
energy
,
rather
high
energy
compared
to
visible
light
photons
.
to
protect
photon
sources
,
one
needs
a
lead
shielding
.
to
stop
the
photons
,
it
takes
a
rather
heavy
material
with
a
rather
high
z
,
such
as
lead
.
here
is
the
lead
container
,
inside
we
have
a
second
lead
container
,
the
source
is
hidden
inside
.
to
remove
the
source
,
i
use
a
pair
of
tweezers
,
i
do
not
touch
the
source
with
my
fingers.inside
there
is
this
little
piece
of
lead
,
which
contains
the
source
in
its
tip
.
so
if
i
place
a
geiger
counter
just
in
front
of
the
source
,
we
see
that
the
count
rate
is
quite
high
.
on
the
contrary
,
if
i
put
the
source
in
its
containers
almost
no
radiation
comes
out
.
so
to
protect
from
a
source
of
Ã®Â³-type
,
one
does
not
just
choose
the
good
material
,
but
also
a
thickness
of
the
shielding
according
to
the
intensity
of
the
source
.
the
more
the
source
intense
,
the
more
lead
i
need
to
stop
all
photons
emerging
from
the
source
.
>
>
in
fact
,
we
did
a
little
calculation
of
the
absorption
of
photons
in
the
minimum
of
their
cross
section
,
in
a
previous
video
.
in
the
old
times
,
in
the
1950s
,
everyone
was
much
more
relaxed
with
respect
to
radioactive
sources
,
right
?
one
even
put
them
into
objects
of
every
day
use
.
can
you
explain
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
radioactive
source
in
this
clock
?
>
>
this
is
an
old
alarm
clock
,
and
to
make
the
hands
visible
during
the
night
,
they
used
radium
to
make
them
phosphorescent
.
today
,
we
use
different
materials
,
such
as
phosphorus
,
but
in
the
past
,
people
used
radium
,
and
this
is
a
very
,
very
dangerous
substance
.
the
reason
why
the
radium
is
so
dangerous
is
that
it
decyas
into
radon
.
radon
is
a
radioactive
element
,
it
is
a
gas
,
which
is
everywhere
in
nature
,
and
we
can
breathe
radon
.
breathing
air
one
also
takes
in
a
portion
of
radon
in
our
lungs
,
where
radon
decays
by
emitting
alpha
particles
,
which
come
in
direct
contact
with
the
tissues
of
our
body
and
can
do
much
damage
.
in
fact
,
radon
is
one
of
the
concerns
we
have
around
the
world
,
in
homes
,
also
in
switzerland.there
are
regions
in
switzerland
,
especially
the
alps
and
the
jura
,
where
there
are
rocks
outgassing
a
lot
of
radon
,
while
in
big
cities
,
like
in
geneva
or
zurich
etc.
,
there
is
not
much
radon
.
>
>
that
is
to
say
that
one
should
not
spend
the
night
in
a
basement
in
the
alps
.
in
a
basement
in
the
alps
.
>
>
exactly
.
houses
must
be
properly
ventilated
.
>
>
and
,
that
's
why
we
have
banned
the
use
of
radium
since
a
long
time
.
to
show
the
effect
,
although
there
is
a
minimum
amount
of
radium
,
which
has
been
deposited
on
the
clock
,
with
the
same
geiger
counter
,
which
i
used
before
,
one
can
reach
a
certain
number
of
counts
,
which
tells
us
that
there
is
a
lot
of
radium
decays
from
this
clock
and
so
it
's
not
a
good
idea
to
sleep
with
such
a
clock
by
the
bedside
.
>
>
and
that
's
why
,
we
have
long
since
banned
using
radium
in
clocks
.
thank
you
very
much
.
