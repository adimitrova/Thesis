during

module

we

discussing
nuclear
physics
and
its
application

and
in
this
third
video
we
will
introduce
simple
models
which
allow
to
better
understand
the
structure
of
nuclei
and
their
properties
.
after
watching
this
video
you
should
be
able
to
describe
these
models
of
nuclear
structure
.
distinguish
which
features
each
model
describes
and
where
it
's
limits
are
and
in
particular
know
the
so-called
magic
nuclei
and
their
special
properties
.
for
reasons
discussed
in
the
previous
videos
we
know
quite
well
the
strong
force
acting
between
quarks
inside
the
protons
and
neutrons
,
thanks
to
quantum
chromodynamics
.
a
complete
theory
of
the
nuclear
force
between
these
based
on
first
principles
of
qcd
however
does
not
exist
.
since
we
do
not
know
how
to
calculate
the
properties
of
the
nuclear
force
ab
initio
it
is
difficult
to
apprehend
nuclear
structure
theoretically
.
consequently
the
models
of
nuclear
structure
are
rather
qualitative
.
most
precede
qcd
itself
,
the
models
of
nuclear
structure
are
rather
qualitative
.
however
,
one
can
of
course
base
model
building
on
experimental
facts
and
on
physical
intuition
.
each
of
these
models
presented
in
the
following
will
concentrate
on
a
particular
aspect
of
nuclear
structure
and
nuclear
properties
.
so
let
us
start
with
the
most
simple
one
which
is
called
the
liquid
drop
model
.
in
this
model
,
which
has
been
the
first
phenomenological
model
to
describe
the
binding
energy
and
size
of
nuclei
,
the
quantum
properties
of
nucleons
are
largely
ignored
or
taken
into
account
in
an
ad
hoc
way
.
the
model
describes
the
nucleus
as
a
compact
packing
of
incompressible
nucleons
.
this
gives
a
total
nuclear
volume
proportional
to
the
number
of
nuclei
,
as
we
have
observed
.
the
mass
density
of
nuclei
is
approximately
independent
of
a.
this
considerations
lead
to
imagine
the
nucleus
like
an
incompressible
drop
of
liquid
.
the
molecules
of
the
liquid
are
the
nuclei
.
the
van
der
waals
force
is
replaced
by
nuclear
force
.
the
binding
energy
Ã¢ÂÂm
or
be
on
this
slide
is
equal
to
the
mass
difference
between
the
nucleus
and
the
sum
of
it
's
nucleons
.
it
is
the
energy
won
by
the
bound
system
and
thus
negative
for
stable
nuclear
states
.
it
is
principally
proportional
to
a
,
i.e
.
to
the
number
of
nuclei
or
the
nuclear
volume
.
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
each
nucleon
mostly
interacts
with
it
's
nearest
neighbors
.
but
the
nucleons
on
the
outer
boundary
have
less
neighbors
and
are
less
tightly
bound
.
this
is
taken
into
account
by
a
term
proportional
to
the
nuclear
surface
a
to
power
two-thirds
.
it
's
always
analogous
to
the
surface
tension
of
a
liquid
drop
.
it
reduce
the
binding
energy
,
per
nucleon
,
and
it
makes
the
binding
energy
somewhat
less
negative
.
hence
it
has
a
positive
sign
.
this
surface
term
is
more
important
for
heavy
than
for
light
nuclei
,
which
explains
their
less
tight
binding
.
the
third
term
takes
into
account
the
energy
of
coulomb
repulsion
between
protons
.
this
term
also
decreases
the
absolute
value
of
the
binding
energy
and
thus
has
are
positive
side
.
up
to
now
the
considerations
are
purely
classical
but
corrections
inspired
by
quantum
effects
are
important
.
like
nuclei
with
a
equal
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
,
that
is
to
say
z=n
,
are
particularly
stable
.
they
have
a
more
negative
binding
energy
.
also
there
are
more
stable
even-even
nuclei
and
few
stable
odd-odd
nuclei
.
odd
and
even
refers
to
the
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
.
one
thus
adds
two
empirical
terms
to
obtain
what
is
called
the
bethe-weizsacker
formula
.
the
asymmetry
terms
reduces
the
binding
energy
for
n
not
equal
to
z
and
the
pairing
term
has
a
positive
sign
for
odd-odd
nuclei
which
are
less
stable
.
for
even-even
nuclei
the
sign
is
negative
and
the
nuclei
more
stable
.
for
all
other
combinations
,
i.e
.
for
odd
a
,
the
last
term
is
zero
.
once
the
coefficients
of
the
terms
a_1
through
a_4
are
adjusted
to
match
nuclear
masses
,
the
formula
describes
rather
accurately
the
binding
of
sufficiently
heavy
nuclei
.
it
is
less
accurate
for
light
nuclei
,
and
it
fails
especially
to
match
the
exceptionally
large
binding
energy
of
the
very
stable
he-4
nucleus
.
however
,
we
will
use
it
extensively
to
qualitatively
understand
the
phenomena
of
fusion
and
fission
.
an
approach
more
compatible
with
the
quantum
nature
of
subatomic
particles
is
the
fermi
gas
model
.
in
this
model
,
the
nucleus
is
described
as
a
gas
of
free
protons
and
neutrons
,
confined
to
the
nuclear
volume
by
a
potential
of
unspecified
origin
.
the
nuclei
then
occupy
quantized
energy
levels
,
the
potential
is
modelled
as
a
spherical
well
.
it
's
size
represents
the
size
of
the
nucleus
.
it
's
depth
is
adjusted
to
obtain
the
right
binding
energy
.
the
difference
between
the
ground
states
of
protons
and
neutrons
is
due
to
the
coulomb
potential
which
is
only
present
for
protons
and
decreases
the
depth
of
a
potential
well
.
since
n
and
p
are
fermions
there
can
be
only
two
per
energy
level
with
opposite
spin
.
the
last
filled
energy
level
defines
the
energy
which
refers
to
the
least
tightly
bound
nucleons
.
so
how
many
nucleons
can
we
store
in
a
given
volume
?
it
's
the
schrÃ£Â¶dinger
equation
that
gives
us
the
answer
.
we
consider
the
nucleons
to
be
confined
to
a
square
box
with
side
a.
the
solution
can
then
be
factorized
with
n_x
,
n_y
,
and
n_z
positive
integer
numbers
and
a
normalization
factor
a.
the
phase
space
is
thus
quantified
.
setting
e
equal
to
p^2/2m
one
sees
that
k_i
are
the
wave
numbers
equal
to
the
momentum
along
each
axis
in
natural
units
.
so
now
we
can
count
states
,
let
us
consider
momentum
space
.
due
to
the
boundary
conditions
,
for
each
elementary
cube
of
side
pi/a
there
is
a
single
point
which
is
compatible
with
the
schrÃ£Â¶dinger
equation
.
the
number
of
viable
solutions
with
the
wave
number
between
k
and
k
+
dk
is
thus
the
ratio
of
the
corresponding
spherical
shell
and
the
volume
element
,
(
pi/a
)
^3rd
.
the
volume
of
the
box
is
a
cube
but
we
only
consider
1/8
,
since
all
k_i
must
be
positive
.
in
the
grand
state
all
levels
up
to
the
maximum
momentum
are
filled
.
integrating
up
to
the
fermi
mo
,
entum
one
does
obtains
the
number
of
states
which
can
fill
the
volume
.
one
must
of
course
take
into
account
the
factor
of
two
for
the
two
spin
orientations
,
as
well
as
the
nuclear
volume
,
which
is
4
(
pi/3
)
r_0^3
a.
the
energy
corresponding
to
the
maximum
momentum
is
,
what
is
called
a
fermi
energy
,
e_f
.
it
is
approximately
33
mev
independent
of
a.
the
result
is
in
fact
also
independent
of
the
shape
of
the
confinement
volume
.
the
value
of
the
fermi
energy
means
that
the
nucleons
are
non
relativistic
inside
the
nucleus
but
still
move
at
a
considerable
velocity
,
Ã£Â
equal
to
roughly
0.4.
the
nucleus
is
thus
a
very
dynamic
environment
indeed
.
the
model
also
explains
in
a
rather
natural
way
the
asymmetry
term
of
the
bethe-weizsÃ£Â¤cker
equation
.
given
e_f
the
fermi
energy
and
the
binding
energy
of
the
last
nucleon
of
roughly
8
mev
we
obtain
a
potential
depth
v_0
of
about
40
mev
.
in
analogy
with
the
atomic
shell
model
,
a
shell
model
for
the
nucleus
can
be
constructed
.
the
orbital
quantum
number
n
describes
the
energy
level
of
the
nuclei
.
for
each
n
,
there
are
n
levels
of
orbital
angular
momentum
l
and
2l+1
subshells
of
the
projection
of
l
on
an
arbitrary
axis
.
these
subshells
are
degenerate
in
energy
because
of
the
rotational
symmetry
of
the
coulomb
potential
.
there
are
two
spin
states
per
subshell
with
m_s
equal
to
Ã¢Â±1/2
.
a
state
can
thus
be
described
by
four
quantum
numbers
,
n
,
l
,
m_l
,
and
m_s
.
the
nuclei
with
completely
filled
shells
are
particularly
stable
,
which
explains
the
notion
of
magic
numbers
,
which
are
z
or
n
equal
to
2
,
8
,
20
,
28
,
50
,
82
,
126
,
and
so
forth
.
isotopes
with
shells
of
both
protons
and
neutrons
completely
filled
,
i.e
.
with
z
and
n
equal
to
a
magic
number
are
even
more
stable
.
example
of
these
doubly
magic
nuclei
are
he-4
,
o-16
,
ca-40
,
ca-48
,
ni-48
,
ni-56
and
pb-208
.
one
of
the
strong
points
of
the
shell
model
is
its
prediction
of
nuclear
spins
.
according
to
the
model
p
and
n
fill
up
the
levels
independently
,
two
in
each
subshell
due
to
the
pauli
principle
.
in
this
way
,
the
last
or
valence
nucleon
,
which
does
not
have
a
pair
,
will
determine
the
nuclei
spin
.
the
immediate
consequence
is
that
even-even
nuclei
should
have
spin
0
in
agreement
with
observation
.
however
the
share
model
fails
to
predict
the
spin
of
odd-odd
nuclei
since
it
does
not
include
interactions
between
protons
and
neutrons
.
when
the
correct
spin
is
predicted
,
the
model
also
gets
the
nuclear
magnetic
moments
right
,
which
is
important
for
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
phenomena
for
example
.
we
will
talk
about
that
when
we
treat
applications
of
nuclear
physics
.
it
is
obvious
that
more
sophisticated
nuclear
models
than
those
we
have
treated
here
can
be
constructed
.
but
that
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
this
introductory
course
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
rather
go
over
the
properties
of
unstable
nuclei
and
their
radioactive
decays
.
