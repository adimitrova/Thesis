here in second module, 
in process dealing 
nuclear physics applications 
we underlined several times that 
basics nuclear force in terms 
quantum chronodynamics, 
anything clear 
purpose this optional interlude 
is to trigger a discussion 
this particular subject 
relation between nuclear force 
binds together nucleons inside 
nucleus strong force 
binds quarks to form hadrons 
is clear although 
two must obviously related 
in fact nuclear force ought 
to a long range effect qcd, 
binding nucleons via 
color neutral objects 
an interesting discussion is found in this 
article one fathers qcd, 
fred wilczek, in journal nature, 
source is quoted top slide 
an accessible summary found 
web address quoted bottom 
here is a short excerpt 
that i will read to you 
ironically, perspective 
qcd foundations nuclear physics 
appear distinctively unsound 
continues explaining 
contradiction is 
yet qcd tells us that protons neutrons 
built quarks 
gluons that move 
nearly speed light 
basic particles 
carry color charge, 
leading to additional requirement 
that confined within bags 
whose contents overall colorneutral 
asks, 
dont a separate proton 
neutron bags in a complex 
nucleus merge a common bag 
face it, one bag 
arrangement a lot going 
would allow quarks gluons free 
access to a larger volume space so 
save energy cost localizing 
quantum mechanical wave function 
in a merger, protons neutrons 
would lose individual identities, 
traditional quite successful 
model atomic nuclei would crumble 
prevents that calamity 
i invite you to think 
this question yourself, 
discuss in forum this course 
we will come back to in module five 
will deal hadrons 
strong interaction
