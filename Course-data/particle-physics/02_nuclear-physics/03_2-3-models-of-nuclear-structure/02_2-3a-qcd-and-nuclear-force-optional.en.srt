2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,290
Here in the second module,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,547
we're in the process of dealing with
nuclear physics and it's applications.

4
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:20,905
We have underlined several times that
the basics of the nuclear force in terms

5
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:24,000
of quantum chronodynamics,
are anything but clear.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,160
The purpose of this optional interlude
is to trigger a discussion

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,390
on this particular subject.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,320
The relation between the nuclear force
which binds together nucleons inside

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
the nucleus and the strong force
which binds quarks to form hadrons

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,410
is not clear at all although
the two must be obviously related.

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,525
In fact the nuclear force ought
to be a long range effect of QCD,

12
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,680
binding nucleons via
color neutral objects.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,530
An interesting discussion is found in this
article by one of the fathers of QCD,

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:07,140
Fred Wilczek, in the journal nature, the
source is quoted on the top of the slide.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,980
An accessible summary can be found on the
web at the address quoted on the bottom.

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,140
And here is a short excerpt
that I will read to you.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,420
Ironically, from the perspective of
QCD the foundations of nuclear physics

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,080
appear distinctively unsound.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,040
He continues by explaining
what the contradiction is.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,100
Yet QCD tells us that protons and neutrons
are themselves built from quarks and

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,470
gluons that move at very
nearly the speed of light.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,530
These more basic particles
carry color charge,

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,140
leading to the additional requirement
that they be confined within bags

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,490
whose contents are overall color-neutral.

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,120
And he further asks, but
why don't a separate proton and

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,280
neutron bags in a complex
nucleus merge into a common bag?

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,150
On the face of it, the one bag
arrangement has a lot going for it.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,380
It would allow quarks and gluons free
access to a larger volume of space and so

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,870
save on the energy cost of localizing
their quantum mechanical wave function.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,653
But in such a merger, protons and neutrons
would lose their individual identities,

31
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:15,720
and our traditional quite successful
model of atomic nuclei would crumble.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,130
What prevents that calamity?

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,620
I invite you to think about
this question yourself, and

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,484
discuss it in the forum of this course.

35
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:28,076
We will come back to it in module five
where which will deal with hadrons and

36
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,811
their strong interaction.
