2
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:14,667
During the second module,
we are discussing nuclear physics and

3
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:15,683
its application.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,030
And in this third video we will introduce
simple models which allow to better

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,130
understand the structure of nuclei and
their properties.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,230
After watching this video you
should be able to describe

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,230
these models of nuclear structure.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,774
Distinguish which features each model
describes and where it's limits are and

9
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:38,339
in particular know the so-called magic
nuclei and their special properties.

10
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,452
For reasons discussed in the previous
videos we know quite well

11
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:47,610
the strong force acting between quarks
inside the protons and neutrons,

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,420
thanks to quantum chromodynamics.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,020
A complete theory of the nuclear
force between these based on first

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,420
principles of QCD however does not exist.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,595
Since we do not know how to calculate
the properties of the nuclear force

16
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,890
ab initio it is difficult to apprehend
nuclear structure theoretically.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,650
Consequently the models of nuclear
structure are rather qualitative.

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,502
Most precede QCD itself,

19
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:17,344
the models of nuclear structure
are rather qualitative.

20
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:21,860
However, one can of course base model
building on experimental facts and

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,590
on physical intuition.

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,470
Each of these models presented in the
following will concentrate on a particular

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,710
aspect of nuclear structure and
nuclear properties.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,230
So let us start with the most simple one
which is called the liquid drop model.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,670
In this model, which has been the first phenomenological
model to describe the binding energy and

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,500
size of nuclei, the quantum properties
of nucleons are largely ignored or

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,480
taken into account in an ad hoc way.

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,590
The model describes the nucleus
as a compact packing of

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,920
incompressible nucleons.

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,010
This gives a total nuclear volume
proportional to the number of nuclei,

31
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,270
as we have observed.

32
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,600
The mass density of nuclei is
approximately independent of A.

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,680
This considerations lead to
imagine the nucleus like

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,730
an incompressible drop of liquid.

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,180
The molecules of
the liquid are the nuclei.

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,870
The Van der Waals force is replaced by nuclear force.

37
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,800
The binding energy ∆M or
BE on this slide is equal to

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,690
the mass difference between the nucleus
and the sum of it's nucleons.

39
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,120
It is the energy won by the bound
system and thus negative for

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,200
stable nuclear states.

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,460
It is principally proportional to A,
i.e. to the number of nuclei or

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,740
the nuclear volume.

43
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,920
This is due to the fact that each nucleon

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,480
mostly interacts with
it's nearest neighbors.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,680
But the nucleons on the outer boundary have
less neighbors and are less tightly bound.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,040
This is taken into account by a term

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,344
proportional to the nuclear
surface A to power two-thirds.

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,660
It's always analogous to the surface
tension of a liquid drop.

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,690
It reduce the binding energy, per nucleon,

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,780
and it makes the binding
energy somewhat less negative.

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,530
Hence it has a positive sign.

52
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,160
This surface term is more important for
heavy than for

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,220
light nuclei,
which explains their less tight binding.

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,010
The third term takes into account
the energy of Coulomb repulsion

55
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,290
between protons.

56
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,740
This term also decreases the absolute
value of the binding energy and

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,354
thus has are positive side.

58
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:38,793
Up to now the considerations
are purely classical but

59
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:42,850
corrections inspired by
quantum effects are important.

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,390
Like nuclei with a equal
number of protons and

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,260
neutrons, that is to say Z=N,
are particularly stable.

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,190
They have a more negative binding energy.

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:59,000
Also there are more stable even-even
nuclei and few stable odd-odd nuclei.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,807
Odd and even refers to the number
of protons and neutrons.

65
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:05,950
One thus adds two
empirical terms to obtain

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,080
what is called
the Bethe-Weizsacker formula.

67
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,630
The asymmetry terms reduces the binding
energy for N not equal to Z and

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,280
the pairing term has a positive sign for
odd-odd nuclei which are less stable.

69
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,160
For even-even nuclei the sign is negative and
the nuclei more stable.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
For all other combinations, i.e. for
odd A, the last term is zero.

71
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,710
Once the coefficients of
the terms a_1 through a_4

72
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,530
are adjusted to match nuclear masses,

73
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,340
the formula describes rather accurately the binding
of sufficiently heavy nuclei.

74
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,060
It is less accurate for light nuclei,

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,300
and it fails especially to match
the exceptionally large binding energy

76
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,410
of the very stable He-4 nucleus.

77
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,060
However, we will use it extensively
to qualitatively understand

78
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,469
the phenomena of fusion and fission.

79
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:09,125
An approach more compatible with
the quantum nature of subatomic particles

80
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,510
is the Fermi gas model.

81
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,940
In this model, the nucleus is
described as a gas of free protons and

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,440
neutrons, confined to the nuclear volume
by a potential of unspecified origin.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,780
The nuclei then occupy
quantized energy levels,

84
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,470
the potential is modelled
as a spherical well.

85
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,740
It's size represents
the size of the nucleus.

86
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,950
It's depth is adjusted to obtain
the right binding energy.

87
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,490
The difference between
the ground states of protons and

88
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,430
neutrons is due to the Coulomb potential
which is only present for protons and

89
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,455
decreases the depth of a potential well.

90
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:48,880
Since n and p are fermions there can be only two per
energy level with opposite spin.

91
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,540
The last filled energy
level defines the energy

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,000
which refers to the least
tightly bound nucleons.

93
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,900
So how many nucleons can
we store in a given volume?

94
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,120
It's the Schrödinger equation
that gives us the answer.

95
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,680
We consider the nucleons to be
confined to a square box with side a.

96
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,550
The solution can then be factorized with n_x, n_y,

97
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,990
and n_z positive integer numbers and
a normalization factor a.

98
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,930
The phase space is thus quantified.

99
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,740
Setting E equal to p^2/2m

100
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,710
one sees that k_i are the wave
numbers equal to the momentum

101
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,690
along each axis in natural units.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,740
So now we can count states,
let us consider momentum space.

103
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,470
Due to the boundary conditions, for
each elementary cube of side pi/a

104
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,420
there is a single point which is compatible
with the Schrödinger equation.

105
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,880
The number of viable solutions
with the wave number between k and

106
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,410
k + dk is thus the ratio of
the corresponding spherical shell and

107
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,020
the volume element, (pi/a)^3rd.

108
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,740
The volume of the box is a cube but

109
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,260
we only consider 1/8,
since all k_i must be positive.

110
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,430
In the grand state all levels up to
the maximum momentum are filled.

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,860
Integrating up to the Fermi mo,entum one does obtains the
number of states which can fill the volume.

112
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,740
One must of course take into
account the factor of two for

113
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,290
the two spin orientations,
as well as the nuclear volume,

114
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,950
which is 4 (pi/3) r_0^3 A.

115
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,020
The energy corresponding
to the maximum momentum is,

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,700
what is called a Fermi energy, E_F.

117
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,300
It is approximately 33 MeV independent of A.

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,870
The result is in fact also independent of
the shape of the confinement volume.

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,370
The value of the Fermi energy
means that the nucleons

120
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,410
are non relativistic
inside the nucleus but

121
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,560
still move at a considerable
velocity, ß equal to roughly 0.4.

122
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,980
The nucleus is thus a very
dynamic environment indeed.

123
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,350
The model also explains
in a rather natural way

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,980
the asymmetry term of the Bethe-Weizsäcker equation.

125
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,662
Given E_F the Fermi energy and
the binding energy of the last nucleon of

126
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:17,694
roughly 8 MeV we obtain a potential
depth V_0 of about 40 MeV.

127
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,814
In analogy with the atomic shell model,
a shell model for

128
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:26,580
the nucleus can be constructed.

129
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,230
The orbital quantum number n describes
the energy level of the nuclei.

130
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,475
For each n, there are n levels of
orbital angular momentum l and

131
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:44,400
2l+1 subshells of the projection
of l on an arbitrary axis.

132
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,040
These subshells are degenerate in energy

133
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,530
because of the rotational symmetry
of the Coulomb potential.

134
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:57,317
There are two spin states per subshell
with m_s equal to ±1/2.

135
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:06,010
A state can thus be described by four
quantum numbers, n, l, m_l, and m_s.

136
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,730
The nuclei with completely filled
shells are particularly stable,

137
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,460
which explains the notion of
magic numbers, which are Z or

138
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,459
N equal to 2, 8, 20, 28,
50, 82, 126, and so forth.

139
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,310
Isotopes with shells of both protons and
neutrons completely filled,

140
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,860
i.e. with Z and N equal to a magic
number are even more stable.

141
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,568
Example of these doubly
magic nuclei are He-4,

142
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:41,184
O-16, Ca-40, Ca-48,

143
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:45,441
Ni-48, Ni-56 and PB-208.

144
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:50,840
One of the strong points of the shell
model is its prediction of nuclear spins.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,390
According to the model p and

146
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,940
n fill up the levels independently, two in
each subshell due to the Pauli principle.

147
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,490
In this way, the last or valence nucleon,

148
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,040
which does not have a pair, will
determine the nuclei spin.

149
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,990
The immediate consequence is that
even-even nuclei should have spin 0 in

150
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,530
agreement with observation.

151
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,160
However the share model fails to
predict the spin of odd-odd nuclei

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,260
since it does not include interactions
between protons and neutrons.

153
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,830
When the correct spin is predicted,

154
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,130
the model also gets the nuclear
magnetic moments right,

155
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,200
which is important for nuclear magnetic
resonance phenomena for example.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,480
We will talk about that when we treat
applications of nuclear physics.

157
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,780
It is obvious that more sophisticated
nuclear models than those

158
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,630
we have treated here can be constructed.

159
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,060
But that goes beyond the scope
of this introductory course.

160
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,059
In the next video, we will rather go over
the properties of unstable nuclei and

161
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,520
their radioactive decays.
