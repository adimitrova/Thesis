second module, 
we discussing nuclear physics 
application 
in this third video we will introduce 
simple models allow to better 
understand structure nuclei 
properties 
watching this video you 
able to describe 
models nuclear structure 
distinguish features model 
describes limits 
in particular know socalled magic 
nuclei special properties 
reasons discussed in previous 
videos we know quite well 
strong force acting between quarks 
inside protons neutrons, 
thanks to quantum chromodynamics 
a complete theory nuclear 
force between based first 
principles qcd however exist 
since we know to calculate 
properties nuclear force 
ab initio is difficult to apprehend 
nuclear structure theoretically 
consequently models nuclear 
structure rather qualitative 
precede qcd itself, 
models nuclear structure 
rather qualitative 
however, one course base model 
building experimental facts 
physical intuition 
models presented in 
following will concentrate a particular 
aspect nuclear structure 
nuclear properties 
so let us start simple one 
is called liquid drop model 
in this model, first phenomenological 
model to describe binding energy 
size nuclei, quantum properties 
nucleons largely ignored 
taken account in an ad hoc way 
model describes nucleus 
a compact packing 
incompressible nucleons 
this gives a total nuclear volume 
proportional to number nuclei, 
we observed 
mass density nuclei is 
approximately independent a 
this considerations lead to 
imagine nucleus like 
an incompressible drop liquid 
molecules 
liquid nuclei 
van der waals force is replaced nuclear force 
binding energy m 
this slide is equal to 
mass difference between nucleus 
sum nucleons 
is energy won bound 
system thus negative 
stable nuclear states 
is principally proportional to a, 
ie to number nuclei 
nuclear volume 
this is due to fact that nucleon 
mostly interacts 
nearest neighbors 
nucleons outer boundary 
less neighbors less tightly bound 
this is taken account a term 
proportional to nuclear 
surface a to power twothirds 
always analogous to surface 
tension a liquid drop 
reduce binding energy, per nucleon, 
makes binding 
energy somewhat less negative 
hence a positive sign 
this surface term is important 
heavy 
light nuclei, 
explains less tight binding 
third term takes account 
energy coulomb repulsion 
between protons 
this term also decreases absolute 
value binding energy 
thus positive side 
to considerations 
purely classical 
corrections inspired 
quantum effects important 
like nuclei a equal 
number protons 
neutrons, that is to say zn, 
particularly stable 
a negative binding energy 
also there stable eveneven 
nuclei few stable oddodd nuclei 
odd even refers to number 
protons neutrons 
one thus adds two 
empirical terms to obtain 
is called 
betheweizsacker formula 
asymmetry terms reduces binding 
energy n equal to z 
pairing term a positive sign 
oddodd nuclei less stable 
eveneven nuclei sign is negative 
nuclei stable 
combinations, ie 
odd a, last term is zero 
coefficients 
terms a a 
adjusted to match nuclear masses, 
formula describes rather accurately binding 
sufficiently heavy nuclei 
is less accurate light nuclei, 
fails especially to match 
exceptionally large binding energy 
stable nucleus 
however, we will use extensively 
to qualitatively understand 
phenomena fusion fission 
an approach compatible 
quantum nature subatomic particles 
is fermi gas model 
in this model, nucleus is 
described a gas free protons 
neutrons, confined to nuclear volume 
a potential unspecified origin 
nuclei occupy 
quantized energy levels, 
potential is modelled 
a spherical well 
size represents 
size nucleus 
depth is adjusted to obtain 
right binding energy 
difference between 
ground states protons 
neutrons is due to coulomb potential 
is present protons 
decreases depth a potential well 
since n p fermions there two per 
energy level opposite spin 
last filled energy 
level defines energy 
refers to least 
tightly bound nucleons 
so many nucleons 
we store in a given volume 
schrdinger equation 
that gives us answer 
we consider nucleons to 
confined to a square box side a 
solution factorized nx, ny, 
nz positive integer numbers 
a normalization factor a 
phase space is thus quantified 
setting e equal to pm 
one sees that ki wave 
numbers equal to momentum 
along axis in natural units 
so we count states, 
let us consider momentum space 
due to boundary conditions, 
elementary cube side pia 
there is a single point is compatible 
schrdinger equation 
number viable solutions 
wave number between k 
k dk is thus ratio 
corresponding spherical shell 
volume element, piard 
volume box is a cube 
we consider , 
since ki must positive 
in grand state levels to 
maximum momentum filled 
integrating to fermi mo,entum one obtains 
number states fill volume 
one must course take 
account factor two 
two spin orientations, 
well nuclear volume, 
is pi r a 
energy corresponding 
to maximum momentum is, 
is called a fermi energy, ef 
is approximately mev independent a 
result is in fact also independent 
shape confinement volume 
value fermi energy 
means that nucleons 
non relativistic 
inside nucleus 
still move a considerable 
velocity, equal to roughly 
nucleus is thus a 
dynamic environment indeed 
model also explains 
in a rather natural way 
asymmetry term betheweizscker equation 
given ef fermi energy 
binding energy last nucleon 
roughly mev we obtain a potential 
depth v mev 
in analogy atomic shell model, 
a shell model 
nucleus constructed 
orbital quantum number n describes 
energy level nuclei 
n, there n levels 
orbital angular momentum l 
l subshells projection 
l an arbitrary axis 
subshells degenerate in energy 
rotational symmetry 
coulomb potential 
there two spin states per subshell 
ms equal to 
a state thus described four 
quantum numbers, n, l, ml, ms 
nuclei completely filled 
shells particularly stable, 
explains notion 
magic numbers, z 
n equal to , , , , 
, , , so forth 
isotopes shells protons 
neutrons completely filled, 
ie z n equal to a magic 
number even stable 
example doubly 
magic nuclei he, 
o, ca, ca, 
ni, ni pb 
one strong points shell 
model is prediction nuclear spins 
according to model p 
n fill levels independently, two in 
subshell due to pauli principle 
in this way, last valence nucleon, 
a pair, will 
determine nuclei spin 
immediate consequence is that 
eveneven nuclei spin in 
agreement observation 
however share model fails to 
predict spin oddodd nuclei 
since include interactions 
between protons neutrons 
correct spin is predicted, 
model also gets nuclear 
magnetic moments right, 
is important nuclear magnetic 
resonance phenomena example 
we will talk that we treat 
applications nuclear physics 
is obvious that sophisticated 
nuclear models 
we treated here constructed 
that goes beyond scope 
this introductory course 
in next video, we will rather go

radioactive decays
