in this second module, we discussing 
nuclear physics applications 
in this ninth video we will continue 
discussing transformation a portion 
nuclear binding energy 
heat fission process 
following this video, 
you will know fission is used 
controlled inside nuclear power plants 
natural uranium is a mixture 
u u 
u a five time shorter 
lifetime isotope 
natural mixture therefore 
contains a small fraction u 
enriched uranium is 
a material in u 
component increased 
isotope separation 
this separation uses small difference 
in mass between two isotopes to 
separate them, example, in a gas 
centrifuge filled uranium fluoride 
in devices rotation generates 
an enrichment light element towards 
axis, 
heavier element 
towards periphery 
devices used in parallel 
in series to obtain required 
quantities 
desired level enrichment 
enriched uranium is a critical component 
civil military applications 
a nuclear bomb usually contains 
least u 
a simple ineffective weapon 
already obtained a minimum 
international atomic energy agency, 
iaea, attempts to monitor 
control production storage 
fissile materials around world 
in controlled environment 
a nuclear reactor, chain reaction 
k roughly equal to 
used a sustained energy source 
reactor core contains fuel 
rods a fissile material, 
control rods a neutron absorber 
a moderator to reduce neutron 
kinetic energy thermalize 
thermal neutrons incident 
natural uranium radiatively 
captured u 
will thus cause fission 
thats one uses uranium 
enriched to to 
u fuel in nuclear reactors 
control rods in a reactor 
regulate neutron rate 
often made cadmium a 
high cross section neutron absorption 
inserting removing rods one 
manages flow neutrons therefore 
reaction rate to keep k close to one 
therefore a constant power source 
role moderator, 
hand, 
is to slow neutrons scattering to 
increase thir probability capture 
therefore increase fission rate 
a material small absorption 
cross section is chosen 
water, ho, is used in light water 
reactors often found in western countries 
in research reactors designed to 
produce a large flux neutrons, 
one also uses heavy water, do, 
crosssection 
neutron capture is smaller in 
deuterium is in hydrogen 
in reactors rbmk type like 
chernobyl nuclear power plant, 
graphite moderation rods 
used in addition to water 
in a nuclear power plant reactor 
core is immersed in a cooling liquid, 
actually water 
goal is to collect 
heat generated core 
a heat exchanger cooling 
water is used to produce steam 
will in turn drive 
turbines to generate electricity 
exit turbines 
steam is condensed recycled 
residual heat is often removed 
cooling towers dumped rivers 
second goal coolant is to keep 
core temperature control 
prevent a meltdown core 
whole is surrounded 
a containment building, 
small roundish building 
left this picture, 
in order to avoid contamination 
environment radiation 
beginning an exploitation cycle, 
value k is set to slightly 
one, until desired 
power level is reached 
this point, k will reduced 
to one to a stable power source 
we already calculated impressive 
maximum energy yield related to nuclear 
fission 
ignoring efficiency 
power plants losses, 
one gram uranium is equivalent to 
three tons coal in heat output 
this explains important usage this 
energy source in developed countries 
march , , 
reactors shown in this map, 
operating in countries, 
a total installed 
capacity gigawatt net 
reactors construction 
in , global 
electrical energy 
produced nuclear power 
however, nuclear reactors 
today years old 
economic crisis in 
fukushima nuclear accident 
caused a decrease in production 
nuclear electricity 
in compared to 
countries germany, belgium, 
switzerland taiwan announced 
end usage nuclear power 
countries longer engage 
in new nuclear power plants 
according to wikipedia, 
construction reactors appears 
several years late this time 
nine construction 
since years 
however, fight 
global warming 
necessary reduction fossil 
fuels may change impression that 
nuclear fission is a power 
source in decline 
in next video, we will present 
principles nuclear fusion a source 
heat see works in stars 
in future power plants
