2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,329
In this second module, we are discussing
nuclear physics and its applications.

3
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:21,823
In this ninth video we will continue
discussing the transformation of a portion

4
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:25,590
of nuclear binding energy into
heat through the fission process.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,485
After following this video,
you will know how fission is used and

6
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:33,691
controlled inside nuclear power plants.

7
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:42,137
Natural uranium is a mixture of
only 0.7% U-235 and 99.3% U-238.

8
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:48,099
U-235 has a five time shorter
lifetime than the other isotope and

9
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:54,820
the natural mixture therefore only
contains a small fraction of U-235.

10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,095
Enriched uranium is
a material in which the U-235

11
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,467
component has been increased
by isotope separation.

12
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:08,507
This separation uses the small difference
in mass between the two isotopes to

13
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:14,038
separate them, for example, in a gas
centrifuge filled with uranium fluoride.

14
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:19,021
In these devices rotation generates
an enrichment of the light element towards

15
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:19,696
the axis,

16
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:22,848
and the heavier element
towards the periphery.

17
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:27,126
The devices are used in parallel and
in series to obtain the required

18
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:30,288
quantities and
the desired level of enrichment.

19
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:36,165
Enriched uranium is a critical component
of both civil and military applications.

20
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:41,610
A nuclear bomb usually contains
at least 85% of U-235.

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,911
But a simple and ineffective weapon can
already be obtained with a minimum of 20%.

22
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,714
The International Atomic Energy Agency,
IAEA, attempts to monitor and

23
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:57,680
control the production and storage of
fissile materials around the world.

24
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:05,571
In the controlled environment of
a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction

25
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:10,163
with k roughly equal to 1 can be
used as a sustained energy source.

26
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,546
The reactor core contains fuel
rods with a fissile material,

27
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,412
control rods with a neutron absorber and

28
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:22,489
a moderator to reduce the neutron
kinetic energy and thermalize them.

29
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,572
Thermal neutrons incident on
natural uranium are radiatively

30
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:33,778
captured by U-238 and
will thus not cause fission.

31
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:38,424
That's why one uses uranium
enriched to 3% to 5% of

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,861
U-235 as fuel in nuclear reactors.

33
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,800
The control rods in a reactor
regulate the neutron rate.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,580
They are often made of cadmium which has a
high cross section for neutron absorption.

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,769
By inserting or removing the rods one
manages the flow of neutrons and therefore

36
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,888
the reaction rate to keep k close to one
and therefore a constant power source.

37
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,529
The role of the moderator,
on the other hand,

38
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:08,207
is to slow down neutrons by scattering to
increase thir probability of capture and

39
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:10,470
therefore increase the fission rate.

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,899
A material with small absorption
cross section is chosen.

41
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:21,426
Water, H_2O, is used in light water
reactors often found in western countries.

42
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:26,312
In research reactors designed to
produce a large flux of neutrons,

43
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,810
one also uses heavy water, D_2O,

44
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,047
because the cross-section for

45
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:35,529
neutron capture is smaller in
deuterium than it is in hydrogen.

46
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:42,025
In reactors of the RBMK type like
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,

47
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:47,410
graphite moderation rods
are used in addition to water.

48
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:54,324
In a nuclear power plant the reactor
core is immersed in a cooling liquid,

49
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,680
actually water.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,230
It's goal is to collect
the heat generated by the core.

51
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,300
Through a heat exchanger the cooling
water is used to produce steam

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,170
which will in turn drive
turbines to generate electricity.

53
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,060
At the exit of the turbines
the steam is condensed and recycled.

54
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,350
The residual heat is often removed through
cooling towers or dumped into rivers.

55
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,880
The second goal of the coolant is to keep
the core temperature under control and

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,350
prevent a meltdown of the core.

57
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,610
The whole is surrounded by
a containment building,

58
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,690
the small roundish building
on the left of this picture,

59
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,360
in order to avoid contamination
of the environment by radiation.

60
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,100
At the beginning of an exploitation cycle,
the value of k is set to slightly above

61
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,920
one, until the desired
power level is reached.

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,978
And at this point, k will be reduced
to one to have a stable power source.

63
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,394
We already calculated the impressive
maximum energy yield related to nuclear

64
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,077
fission.

65
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:01,129
Ignoring the efficiency of
power plants and other losses,

66
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,921
one gram of uranium is equivalent to
three tons of coal in heat output.

67
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:10,657
This explains the important usage of this
energy source in developed countries.

68
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:16,704
On March 31, 2014,
435 reactors shown in this map,

69
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:20,136
were operating in 31 countries,

70
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:25,070
with a total installed
capacity of 372 gigawatt net.

71
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,683
72 reactors were under construction.

72
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:32,678
In 2012, about 10% of the global

73
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:37,739
electrical energy was
produced by nuclear power.

74
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:42,866
However, most nuclear reactors
today are over 20 years old.

75
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,446
The economic crisis in 2008 and

76
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:50,262
the Fukushima nuclear accident
caused a decrease in production of

77
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:55,347
nuclear electricity by about
4% in 2011 compared to 2010.

78
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,502
Countries such as Germany, Belgium,

79
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:02,470
Switzerland and Taiwan have announced
the end of their usage of nuclear power.

80
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,562
Other countries no longer engage
in new nuclear power plants.

81
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,230
According to Wikipedia,

82
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,090
the construction of 18 reactors appears
several years late at this time.

83
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,669
Nine are under construction
since more than 20 years.

84
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,936
However, the fight against
global warming and

85
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:25,835
the necessary reduction of fossil
fuels may change the impression that

86
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:29,029
nuclear fission is a power
source in decline.

87
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,875
In the next video, we will present the
principles of nuclear fusion as a source

88
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,499
of heat and see how it works in stars and
in future power plants.
