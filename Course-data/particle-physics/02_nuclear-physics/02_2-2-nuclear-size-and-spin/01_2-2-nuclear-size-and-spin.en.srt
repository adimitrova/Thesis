2
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:16,000
During this second module, we deal with
nuclear physics and its applications.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
In this second video,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,080
we will summarize what is known about
the size and the spin of nuclei.

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,350
The goals for you are to know how nuclear
size is measured and what the results are.

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,738
To know general facts
about the spin of nuclei.

7
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,434
And to be able to describe the valley
of stability of nuclei

8
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:42,880
as a function of the number of protons and
neutrons.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,786
The size of a subatomic object
must be carefully defined.

10
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:53,835
In a quantum system, it is given by
the root mean square of the eigenvalue of

11
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:56,362
the coordinate operator
in its ground state.

12
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:01,290
For an atom, this is the root mean square
of the radial position of the electron,

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,390
which is farthest away from the nucleus.

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,815
This distance can be calculated
because we know perfectly the binding

15
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:10,471
electromagnetic force

16
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,703
and because it is defined with
respect to a static reference point,

17
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,570
the position of the nucleus.

18
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,540
For the nucleus, we do not have
a simple description of these actions.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,900
So we must interpret
the results of experiments,

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,859
which probe the distribution of
nucleons inside the nucleus.

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,979
It will be unwise to use
hadronic probes to do so

22
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,047
because they are sensitive
to the nuclear force.

23
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,263
High energy electrons, on the contrary,
can penetrate inside the nucleus

24
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:48,860
and their scattering maps out the charge
distribution of the target.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,040
The cross section for

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,288
a point-like target without spin is given
by the Mott formula displayed here.

27
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:59,780
If the charge instead is
distributed according to a volume

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,330
density rho(x),
leaving the total charge intact,

29
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,550
the cross section will be
reduced by form factor F(q),

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,000
which is a function of
the momentum transfer q.

31
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,411
For a static target,

32
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,910
F(q) is the Fourier transform of
the spatial charge distribution.

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,372
For small momentum transfers,

34
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:29,207
we can develop the form
factor in a Taylor series.

35
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,842
If the distribution is
spherically symmetric,

36
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:33,840
the terms with an odd power drop out.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,434
And the dominant second term is
proportional to the mean square radius,

38
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:40,930
<r^2> of the charge distribution.

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,042
And this can serve as a size estimator for
the nucleus.

40
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:48,104
For an exponential charge distribution,

41
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:51,852
the form factor takes what
is called a dipolar form.

42
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:57,587
The dependence of the electron nucleus
cross section on the momentum transfer for

43
00:02:57,587 --> 00:03:01,770
small angle scattering
at high electron energies

44
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,459
is thus used to measure
the size of the nucleus.

45
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:12,086
Scattering experiments establish
a simple relation between

46
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:16,690
the radius of a nucleus R and
the number of nucleons A.

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,140
The radius is proportional to the cube
root of the number of nucleons,

48
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,550
with a universal proportionality
constant of 1.2 femtometers.

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,457
Nuclei are thus indeed small
compared to the atomic size.

50
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:34,840
The nuclear volume is proportional to A.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,902
This corresponds to densely packed and
incompressible nucleons,

52
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,740
which do not fuse.

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,681
The mass density of nuclear matter is
of the order of 10^14 grams

54
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,309
per cm^3.

55
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:56,669
Nuclear spin is the sum of the spin
S of all individual nucleons and

56
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,865
the relative angular momentum, L.

57
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,915
Protons and
neutrons are fermions with spin one-half.

58
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:04,885
Like in atoms,

59
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:10,285
the nuclear angular momentum L
follows an integer quantum number.

60
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:15,065
The total should therefore be a
half integer number if A is odd,

61
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:17,720
an integer if A is even.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,910
Indeed, all nuclei with both N and
Z even have nuclear spin 0.

63
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,390
Heavy nuclei have rather small
nuclear spin in their ground state.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,523
We conclude that neutrons and

65
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:34,781
protons tend to arrange in pairs
of opposite spin direction.

66
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,137
Every charged particle has a magnetic
dipole moment associated with its spin,

67
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,847
including the nuclei.

68
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:50,200
The order of magnitude for an electron
is given by the Bohr magneton, Âµ_B.

69
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,757
The nuclear magneton is three orders
of magnitude smaller due to the larger

70
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,120
proton mass.

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,980
The gyromagnetic factor g measures
the ratio between the angular momentum and

72
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,468
the magnetic moment.

73
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:11,045
For a point charge,
g is about 2 with small deviation of order

74
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:17,110
10^-3 for electrons and
muons as we will see in module 4.

75
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,124
The magnetic moments of proton and
neutron are considerably different,

76
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:29,789
+2.79 and -1.91 nuclear magnetons, respectively.

77
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,340
This is the first indication of
a charged substructure of the nucleons.

78
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,820
In fact, since the neutron has zero net
charge, it must contain charged particles.

79
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,433
All nuclei have measured magnetic
moments between minus three and

80
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,400
ten nuclear magnetons, thus,
relatively small ones.

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,113
This is a consequence of
the spin pairings of nucleons,

82
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:57,747
leading to a limited total
nuclear angular momentum.

83
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:04,950
Most nuclei and
their isotopes are unstable.

84
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,730
Stable nuclei are found in a narrow band,

85
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,440
in the N-Z diagram which is
called the valley of stability.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,402
The valley has the following shape.

87
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:17,680
For lighter nuclei with
atomic mass less than 40,

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,276
the number of neutrons equals
the number of protons.

89
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:25,350
For heavy nuclei with
atomic mass bigger than 40,

90
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,000
the number of neutrons is about
1.7 times the number of protons.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,740
This indicates that for
heavy nuclei, the charge density,

92
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,231
and thus the Coulomb repulsion must
be diluted by additional neutrons.

93
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:45,150
The decay of unstable nuclei is
the source of nuclear radioactivity.

94
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,424
Alpha radioactivity is
the emission of He-4 nuclei or

95
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:53,020
so-called alpha particles.

96
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,805
Beta radioactivity is
the emission of electrons or

97
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,970
positrons together with neutrinos.

98
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,360
And gamma radioactivity is
the emission of photons.

99
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,830
Nuclei with a surplus of
neutrons can be stabilized

100
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,220
by converting a neutron into a proton.

101
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,510
And those with the surplus of protons
can convert a proton into a neutron.

102
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,988
These are isobar decays of
type beta plus or minus.

103
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:23,766
Heavy nuclei often decay into
a pair of lighter nuclei.

104
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:31,030
This corresponds to spontaneous fission,
often by emitting a He-4 nucleus.

105
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,827
This is the alpha decay.

106
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:37,786
This decay is normally related to
an excited state of the daughter nucleus.

107
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:42,162
And they're often followed by a gamma
decay towards the ground states.

108
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:46,489
We will enter into more detail on
these processes in the fourth and

109
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,386
fifth video of this module.

110
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:55,820
So let us summarize what we have
learned about the nuclear force.

111
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,860
It has a very short range
limited to the nuclear size.

112
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,160
The binding energy per nucleon it leads to
is independent of the size of the nucleus.

113
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,790
The nucleon thus interacts only
with its nearest neighbors.

114
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,950
The nuclear force is attractive and

115
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,250
much stronger than the Coulomb
repulsion between protons.

116
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,970
But it must also have a repulsive
component at distances

117
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,320
compatible to the size of the nucleon,
which is about 1 femtometer.

118
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,610
This is due to the existence of
quarks inside the nucleon.

119
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,535
The repulsive component is necessary
to prevent the fusion among nucleons.

120
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:38,226
QCD is a quantum field
theory which describes

121
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,825
the interaction among colored particles,

122
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,853
so quarks inside hadrons,

123
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:47,725
via the exchange of
equally colored gluons.

124
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:54,935
But the strong force acts only inside
hadrons, which thus have a zero net color.

125
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,320
Nucleons cannot exchange gluons.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,470
It is by the exchange of colorless objects
like mesons that they bind together.

127
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,154
This makes the nucleus a complex multibody
object, which is difficult to understand.

128
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:15,399
The appropriate theoretical methods
are effective field theories

129
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,810
like Chiral Perturbation Theory or
a numerical calculation like Lattice QCD.

130
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,890
All of this goes beyond
the scope of this course.

131
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,763
In the next video, we will rather
concentrate on much simpler models,

132
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:33,993
which describe the gross
features of nuclei.

133
