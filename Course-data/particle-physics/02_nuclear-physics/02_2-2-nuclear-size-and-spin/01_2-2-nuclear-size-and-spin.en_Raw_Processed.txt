this second module, we deal 
nuclear physics applications 
in this second video, 
we will summarize is known 
size spin nuclei 
goals you to know nuclear 
size is measured results 
to know general facts 
spin nuclei 
to able to describe valley 
stability nuclei 
a function number protons 
neutrons 
size a subatomic object 
must carefully defined 
in a quantum system, is given 
root mean square eigenvalue 
coordinate operator 
in ground state 
an atom, this is root mean square 
radial position electron, 
is farthest away nucleus 
this distance calculated 
we know perfectly binding 
electromagnetic force 
is defined 
respect to a static reference point, 
position nucleus 
nucleus, we 
a simple description actions 
so we must interpret 
results experiments, 
probe distribution 
nucleons inside nucleus 
will unwise to use 
hadronic probes to so 
sensitive 
to nuclear force 
high energy electrons, contrary, 
penetrate inside nucleus 
scattering maps charge 
distribution target 
cross section 
a pointlike target without spin is given 
mott formula displayed here 
if charge instead is 
distributed according to a volume 
density rhox, 
leaving total charge intact, 
cross section will 
reduced form factor fq, 
is a function 
momentum transfer q 
a static target, 
fq is fourier transform 
spatial charge distribution 
small momentum transfers, 
we develop form 
factor in a taylor series 
if distribution is 
spherically symmetric, 
terms an odd power drop 
dominant second term is 
proportional to mean square radius, 
r charge distribution 
this serve a size estimator 
nucleus 
an exponential charge distribution, 
form factor takes 
is called a dipolar form 
dependence electron nucleus 
cross section momentum transfer 
small angle scattering 
high electron energies 
is thus used to measure 
size nucleus 
scattering experiments establish 
a simple relation between 
radius a nucleus r 
number nucleons a 
radius is proportional to cube 
root number nucleons, 
a universal proportionality 
constant femtometers 
nuclei thus indeed small 
compared to atomic size 
nuclear volume is proportional to a 
this corresponds to densely packed 
incompressible nucleons, 
fuse 
mass density nuclear matter is 
order grams 
per cm 
nuclear spin is sum spin 
individual nucleons 
relative angular momentum, l 
protons 
neutrons fermions spin onehalf 
like in atoms, 
nuclear angular momentum l 
follows an integer quantum number 
total therefore a 
half integer number if a is odd, 
an integer if a is even 
indeed, nuclei n 
z even nuclear spin 
heavy nuclei rather small 
nuclear spin in ground state 
we conclude that neutrons 
protons tend to arrange in pairs 
opposite spin direction 
every charged particle a magnetic 
dipole moment associated spin, 
including nuclei 
order magnitude an electron 
is given bohr magneton, b 
nuclear magneton is three orders 
magnitude smaller due to larger 
proton mass 
gyromagnetic factor g measures 
ratio between angular momentum 
magnetic moment 
a point charge, 
g is small deviation order 
electrons 
muons we will see in module 
magnetic moments proton 
neutron considerably different, 
nuclear magnetons, respectively 
this is first indication 
a charged substructure nucleons 
in fact, since neutron zero net 
charge, must contain charged particles 
nuclei measured magnetic 
moments between minus three 
ten nuclear magnetons, thus, 
relatively small ones 
this is a consequence 
spin pairings nucleons, 
leading to a limited total 
nuclear angular momentum 
nuclei 
isotopes unstable 
stable nuclei found in a narrow band, 
in nz diagram is 
called valley stability 
valley following shape 
lighter nuclei 
atomic mass less , 
number neutrons equals 
number protons 
heavy nuclei 
atomic mass bigger , 
number neutrons is 
times number protons 
this indicates that 
heavy nuclei, charge density, 
thus coulomb repulsion must 
diluted additional neutrons 
decay unstable nuclei is 
source nuclear radioactivity 
alpha radioactivity is 
emission nuclei 
socalled alpha particles 
beta radioactivity is 
emission electrons 
positrons together neutrinos 
gamma radioactivity is 
emission photons 
nuclei a surplus 
neutrons stabilized 
converting a neutron a proton 
surplus protons 
convert a proton a neutron 
isobar decays 
type beta plus minus 
heavy nuclei often decay 
a pair lighter nuclei 
this corresponds to spontaneous fission, 
often emitting a nucleus 
this is alpha decay 
this decay is normally related to 
an excited state daughter nucleus 
theyre often followed a gamma 
decay towards ground states 
we will enter detail 
processes in fourth 
fifth video this module 
so let us summarize we 
learned nuclear force 
a short range 
limited to nuclear size 
binding energy per nucleon leads to 
is independent size nucleus 
nucleon thus interacts 
nearest neighbors 
nuclear force is attractive 
much stronger coulomb 
repulsion between protons 
must also a repulsive 
component distances 
compatible to size nucleon, 
is femtometer 
this is due to existence 
quarks inside nucleon 
repulsive component is necessary 
to prevent fusion among nucleons 
qcd is a quantum field 
theory describes 
interaction among colored particles, 
so quarks inside hadrons, 
via exchange 
equally colored gluons 
strong force acts inside 
hadrons, thus a zero net color 
nucleons cannot exchange gluons 
is exchange colorless objects 
like mesons that bind together 
this makes nucleus a complex multibody 
object, is difficult to understand 
appropriate theoretical methods 
effective field theories 
like chiral perturbation theory 
a numerical calculation like lattice qcd 
this goes beyond 
scope this course 
in next video, we will rather 
concentrate much simpler models, 
describe gross 
features nuclei
