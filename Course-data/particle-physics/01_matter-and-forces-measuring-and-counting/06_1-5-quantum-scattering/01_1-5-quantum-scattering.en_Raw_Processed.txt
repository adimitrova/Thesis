in this first module, in process 
introducing objects studied 
particle physics, namely matter, 
forces spacetime 
in this context we must obviously 
discuss scattering processes 
in this fifth video, we will show to 
approach scattering processes between 
particles in a quantum way 
goals you to identify 
conceptual differences 
between classical approach 
that weve used to now, 
quantum evolution a system 
to know to draw 
a feynman diagram 
simple scattering processes 
explain ingredients 
in video mercedes calculated 
differential cross section 
coulomb scattering a static target, 
is reproduced here 
lucky coincidence, 
classical result is still valid 
in a relativistic quantum context 
reasons following 
result quantum theory 
contains factor hbar 
this means that artificial limit hbar 
going to zero normally takes us back 
to classical result will 
change answer that we obtained 
classical result is also valid 
in relativistic regime already 
this fact is surprising, 
maxwells equations valid 
relativistic velocities 
all, 
also include motion photons 
we also need to take account 
nuclear interactions between projectile 
target, since alpha particle will 
never penetrate target nucleus, 
even a headon collision 
electromagnetic force 
acts outside nuclear volume 
until now, we discussed 
scattering process in a language 
adapted to classical physics 
now, we will change toolkit to 
discuss quantum approach 
so while classical results 
stays valid in quantum regime, 
interpretation is totally different 
particles may well pointlike 
move like a probability wave 
also, heisenbergs principle, 
impact perimeter b 
role in consideration 
we must use a scenario la huygen to 
understand scattering works 
this means that target particle will 
origin a new scattered wave, 
will add to incoming 
wave projectile 
classical trajectory is replaced 
wave function psix, 
weve mentioned earlier 
contains particle aspect, energy 
momentum, 
wave expect, frequency wave number, 
kinematics time 
scattering, projectile 
is described a plane wave 
in x direction in little example 
here we also normalized 
amplitude to one simplicity 
huygens principle says 
that a small fraction f 
incident amplitude will 
spherically reemitted target 
factor r in 
scattered amplitude is necessary 
ensures that number scattered 
particles, psi psi, remains 
independent distance 
remaining amplitude f 
continues an unperturbed plane wave 
a consequence wave approach we 
must also reinterpret cross section 
in terms intensities incoming 
scattered wave 
this means that we look 
a relation between cross section 
scattered amplitude ftheta,phi 
square second term is 
proportional to number particles 
scattered a volume 
subtended a solid 
angle domega, radial thickness dr 
represents scattered flux 
a normalized incident wave 
particle density is rho 
thus incident flux is simply rho times 
velocity, velocity 
ratio between scattered 
incoming flux is precisely 
cross section 
we find a simple result, 
f is probability amplitude 
scattering process 
sigma f 
is scattering probability 
amplitude f is calculable if we know 
potential generated target, 
like in classical sense 
to visualize reactions between particles 
calculate probability, 
we use a very, useful tool 
is called feynman diagrams 
represent lines propagation 
particles in coordinates e p 
in spacetime in momentum space 
also represent vertices 
an interaction, that is points 
a force particle is emitted 
absorbed to transmit energy momentum 
finally represent virtual 
particles living between two vertices 
properties 
real counter part, 
mass a free particle 
feynman diagrams a useful 
visualization a reaction 
also a prescription 
calculating probability amplitude 
one that applying 
is called feynman rules 
vertex energy, momentum, 
quantum numbers rigorously conserved 
virtual particle transfers 
energy momentum one 
particles to one, thus a force 
act between projectile target 
details to construct a feynman 
diagram will discussed in module 
we talk electromagnetic 
interactions in a quantum way 
type elementary 
interaction there is a spin one boson 
transmitting force 
we explained 
collectively called gauge bosons 
photon transmits electromagnetic 
interactions, w 
z bosons transmit two 
forms weak interactions 
eight different 
gluons responsible 
transmitting strong interactions 
to absorb 
emit one bosons a particle 
must carry required type charge 
in jargon we say boson 
couples to a given charge 
charge is thus a coupling constant 
needs electrical charge 
q to couple to photon 
q one component 
needs weak isospin 
to couple to w z 
this charge two components 
needs color charge r, 
g b to couple to gluons 
this charge three components 
probability amplitude to emit 
absorb a gauge boson is proportional 
to charge particle 
probability is thus proportional to 
square charge we found 
rutherford scattering already 
in feynman diagram vertex 
energy momentum conserved 
forget that virtual 
particles relate two vertices 
necessarily mass 
real counterpart 
even a real number mass 
vertex charges 
well baryon lepton number conserved 
flavor is conserved electromagnetic 
strong interactions we stated 
weak one 
charge weak interactions transmitted a 
w boson in fact change a particle flavor 
here a few examples allowed 
forbidden vertices 
lets start in top row left 
in this top left diagram, neither 
photon 
z boson 
change flavor lepton 
electron must thus stay an electron 
in second top diagram left, 
conservation charge requires that 
emitted w boson a negative charge 
we emit a negative boson 
righthand diagram, we show 
a diagram that simply exist 
since electron carry color 
charge, cannot emit absorb a gluon 
so this diagram is simply nonexistant 
lets go bottom 
row diagrams 
left you find a u quark 
that emits a photon a z 
neither two particles 
change flavor 
quark that must stay a u 
quark cannot become quark 
in middle diagram, flavor changes 
u quark becomes a d 
quark emitting a w 
if you make balance 
charges you start 
a plus twothird charge you come 
a minus onethird charge quark 
so you must emit a w 
to conserve charge 
rightmost diagram is 
a diagram strong interactions 
incoming red d quark emits a gluon 
becomes a green d quark 
in order to conserve color quantum 
numbers carried gluon must red, 
antigreen 
hand, gluon is 
able to change flavor 
particles that d 
quark must indeed stay d quark 
in next video we will visit 
laboratory nuclear 
physics course university geneva to 
see students go to measure 
rutherford crosssection
