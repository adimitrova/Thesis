2
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:15,926
In this first module, we're in the process
of introducing objects studied by

3
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:19,412
particle physics, namely matter,
forces and space-time.

4
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:23,610
And in this context we must obviously
discuss scattering processes.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,170
In this fifth video, we will show how to
approach the scattering processes between

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,740
particles in a quantum way.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,060
The goals for you are to identify
the conceptual differences

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,050
between the classical approach
that we've used up to now, and

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,670
the quantum evolution of a system.

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,108
And to know how to draw
a Feynman diagram for

11
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:46,583
simple scattering processes and
explain its ingredients.

12
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:53,654
In video 1.4 Mercedes has calculated
the differential cross section for

13
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:59,060
Coulomb scattering off a static target,
which is reproduced here.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,330
By lucky coincidence,

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,490
the classical result is still valid
in a relativistic quantum context.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,690
The reasons are the following.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,190
The result of quantum theory
contains no factor of hbar.

18
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,110
This means that the artificial limit hbar
going to zero which normally takes us back

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,630
to the classical result will not
change the answer that we obtained.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,530
The classical result is also valid
in the relativistic regime already.

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,790
This fact is not surprising,

22
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,590
Maxwell's equations are valid for
relativistic velocities.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,810
After all,
they also include the motion of photons.

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,700
We also do not need to take into account
nuclear interactions between projectile

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,950
and target, since the alpha particle will
never penetrate into the target nucleus,

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,370
even for a head-on collision.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,310
Only the electromagnetic force
acts outside the nuclear volume.

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,670
But until now, we have discussed
the scattering process in a language

29
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,690
adapted to classical physics.

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,930
Now, we will change toolkit to
discuss the quantum approach.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,510
So while the classical results
stays valid in the quantum regime,

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,220
the interpretation is totally different.

33
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,710
Particles may well be point-like but
they move like a probability wave.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,650
Also, because of Heisenberg's principle,
the impact perimeter b

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,380
has no more role in our consideration.

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,470
We must use a scenario Ã  la Huygen to
understand how scattering works.

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,880
This means that the target particle will
be the origin of a new scattered wave,

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,870
which will add to the incoming
wave of the projectile.

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,760
The classical trajectory is replaced
by the wave function psi(x),

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,420
as we've mentioned earlier.

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,940
It contains the particle aspect, energy and
momentum, and

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,840
the wave expect, frequency and wave number,
of the kinematics at the same time.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,190
Before the scattering, the projectile
is described by a plane wave

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,150
in the x direction in our little example.

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,164
Here we have also normalized
the amplitude to one for simplicity.

46
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:11,740
Huygens' principle says
that a small fraction f

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,980
of the incident amplitude will be
spherically re-emitted by the target.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,040
The factor 1/r in
the scattered amplitude is necessary.

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,120
It ensures that the number of scattered
particles, psi* psi, remains

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,540
independent of distance.

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,240
The remaining amplitude (1-f)
continues as an unperturbed plane wave.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,310
As a consequence of the wave approach we
must also reinterpret the cross section

53
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,350
in terms of intensities of incoming and
scattered wave.

54
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,800
This means that we now look for
a relation between the cross section and

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,435
the scattered amplitude f(theta,phi).

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,100
The square of the second term is
proportional to the number of particles

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
scattered into a volume
subtended by a solid

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,400
angle dOmega, and the radial thickness dr.

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,483
It represents the scattered flux.

60
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:08,999
For a normalized incident wave
the particle density is rho=1.

61
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:16,840
Thus the incident flux is simply rho times
the velocity, or the velocity itself.

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,800
The ratio between the scattered and

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,509
the incoming flux is precisely
the cross section.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,890
We find a simple result,
f is the probability amplitude for

65
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,430
our scattering process.

66
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,560
And sigma = f^2
is the scattering probability itself.

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,104
The amplitude f is calculable if we know
the potential generated by the target,

68
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,041
just like in the classical sense.

69
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:49,262
To visualize reactions between particles
and calculate their probability,

70
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:53,470
we use a very, very useful tool
which is called Feynman diagrams.

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,420
They represent lines of propagation
of particles in coordinates E and p.

72
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,050
Not in space-time but in momentum space.

73
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,990
They also represent the vertices of
an interaction, that is the points where

74
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,370
a force particle is emitted or
absorbed to transmit energy and momentum.

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,150
Finally they represent the virtual
particles living between two vertices.

76
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,820
Those have the properties of
their real counter part, but

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,280
not the mass of a free particle.

78
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,530
Feynman diagrams are a useful
visualization of a reaction but

79
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,380
also a prescription for
calculating their probability amplitude.

80
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,150
One does that by applying
what is called Feynman rules.

81
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,410
At each vertex energy, momentum, and
quantum numbers are rigorously conserved.

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,020
The virtual particle transfers
energy momentum from one of these

83
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,030
particles to the other one, thus a force
act between the projectile and the target.

84
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,320
Details on how to construct a Feynman
diagram will be discussed in module 4

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,470
when we talk about electromagnetic
interactions in a quantum way.

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,616
For each type of elementary
interaction there is a spin one boson

87
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:14,660
transmitting the force as
we have explained before.

88
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,650
They are collectively called gauge bosons.

89
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,200
The photon transmits electromagnetic
interactions, the W and

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,580
Z bosons transmit the two
forms of weak interactions.

91
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,400
And the eight different
gluons are responsible for

92
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,770
transmitting strong interactions.

93
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,860
To absorb or

94
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,030
emit one of these bosons a particle
must carry the required type of charge.

95
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,520
In our jargon we say the boson
couples to a given charge.

96
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,680
The charge is thus a coupling constant.

97
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,030
It needs electrical charge
Q to couple to the photon.

98
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,340
Q has one component.

99
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,040
It needs weak isospin T and
T_3 to couple to W and Z.

100
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,360
This charge has two components.

101
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,830
It needs color charge R,
G or B to couple to gluons.

102
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,090
This charge has three components.

103
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,830
The probability amplitude to emit or

104
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,770
absorb a gauge boson is proportional
to the charge of the particle.

105
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,430
The probability is thus proportional to
the square of the charge as we found for

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,776
Rutherford scattering already.

107
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:23,170
In the Feynman diagram at each vertex
energy and momentum are conserved.

108
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,020
But do not forget that virtual
particles which relate two vertices

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,000
do not necessarily have the mass
of their real counterpart nor

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,160
even a real number as their mass.

111
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,020
At each vertex charges as
well as baryon and lepton number are conserved.

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,210
Flavor is conserved by electromagnetic and

113
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,630
strong interactions as we stated
before but not by the weak one.

114
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,610
Charge weak interactions transmitted by a
W boson in fact change a particle flavor.

115
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,390
Here are a few examples of allowed and
forbidden vertices.

116
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,410
Let's start in the top row on the left.

117
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,080
In this top left diagram, neither
the photon nor 

118
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,340
the Z boson
can change the flavor of the lepton.

119
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,400
The electron must thus stay an electron.

120
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,270
In the second top diagram from the left,

121
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,810
conservation of charge requires that
the emitted W boson has a negative charge.

122
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,600
We can only emit a negative boson.

123
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,860
On the right-hand diagram, we show
a diagram that does simply not exist.

124
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,920
Since the electron does not carry color
charge, it cannot emit or absorb a gluon

125
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,170
so this diagram is simply non-existant.

126
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,270
Now let's go through the bottom
row of these diagrams.

127
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,118
On the left you find a u quark
that emits a photon or a Z.

128
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,030
Neither of these two particles
can change the flavor

129
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,160
of the quark such that it must stay a u
quark and cannot become any other quark.

130
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,330
In the middle diagram, the flavor changes.

131
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,880
The u quark becomes a d
quark by emitting a W.

132
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,660
And if you make the balance of
the charges you start out with

133
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,180
a plus two-third charge and you come out
with a minus one-third charge quark.

134
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,548
So you must emit a W^+
to conserve charge.

135
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:25,860
The right-most diagram is
a diagram of strong interactions.

136
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:33,260
The incoming red d quark emits a gluon and
becomes a green d quark.

137
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,036
And in order to conserve color the quantum
numbers carried by the gluon must be red,

138
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:38,935
anti-green.

139
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:48,071
On the other hand, the gluon is
not able to change the flavor of

140
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:52,635
the particles such that the d
quark must indeed stay at d quark.

141
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,251
In the next video we will visit
the laboratory of the nuclear

142
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:01,169
physics course at University of Geneva to
see how our students go about to measure

143
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,284
the Rutherford cross-section.
