00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:06,190
[MUSIC] >> To conclude 

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,290
the first module of this course,

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,590
we visit the lab course on nuclear physics

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,340
at University of Geneva,

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,630
to see how one does an experiment à la Rutherford.

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,870
I present Dr. Alessandro Bravar, a senior lecturer 

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,710
in our department, who is responsible for this lab course.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,655
He is also an active researcher, like all our collaborators, who is part of 

9
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:50,545
our neutrino physics group and also has his own experiment, which he prepares

10
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:55,605
to measure the detailed properties of muons. It will take place

11
00:00:55,605 --> 00:01:01,155
in a few years at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, near Zurich. 

12
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,690
So in front of us we have a typical set-up for a Rutherford experiment. 

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,570
Alessandro, can you please explain 

14
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,290
the ingredients of this set-up and the way it works?

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,820
>> Okay. 

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,050
Here, we try to repeat the Rutherford measurements, 

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,540
but with modern equipment and a technique 

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,030
that looks a bit like the experiments that we make today to study, 

19
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,240
for example, the electron structure.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,850
So we have, in our case,

21
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,780
 an alpha emitter, which emits alpha particles sent to a target,

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,040
and we are detecting alpha particles scattered by the target.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,260
>> Indeed, it was not Rutherford, who did it first, 

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,420
it was Geiger and Marsden who have implemented his idea.

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,769
>> But it was Rutherford who interpreted the observations of Geiger and Marsden.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,300
So to make this experiment, we have to work in a vacuum. 

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,750
This will require to open this box in a moment, to show all the ingredients.

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,640
The reason that one works in vacuum, is that we use alpha particles

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,740
and alpha particles are already stopped 

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,800
by an air layer of about ten centimeters.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,610
So that the alpha particles can propagate from the source to the target

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,760
and our detector,

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,950
we need to remove all the air that otherwise would stop the particles.

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,590
We have therefore put in in this box with a pump

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,050
that pumps the air; it makes the noise you hear now.

36
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,790
What we will do now is to stop the pump and

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,017
open the cover to see all the ingredients of the experiment.

38
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:52,176
>> Let's go.

39
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:58,355
You open the valve?

40
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:03,325
>> Yes, first thing, open the valve and let the air in, 

41
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,655
otherwise we cannot lift the cover.

42
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,755
>> We hear the faint sound of air entering the vacuum chamber.

43
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:22,500
I think 

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,140
this is it.

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,850
>> Not yet. We have to wait a while. 

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,660
Here we go.

47
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,100
So we open the vacuum chamber and

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
the three main components of the experiment can be seen.

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,560
Here we have a source of americium that emits alpha particles.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,930
Alpha particles travel to a target, here

51
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,900
we use a gold foil with a thickness of 1 micron.

52
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,830
Alpha particles interact with the gold nuclei

53
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,310
and are scattered by the gold nuclei in different directions.

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,970
To detect these alpha particles, we use a silicon detector,

55
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,390
a diode placed in the tube here.

56
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,803
We will see the silicon detector in a little more detail.

57
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,960
Thank you Martin.

58
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,310
That's our silicon detector.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,300
The central part we see here is the active part of the detector,

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,160
while the rest serves to define the acceptance of the detector.

61
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,390
Behind it there is a small connector to measure the electrical signal

62
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,890
generated by alpha particles, which are completely absorbed in this detector.

63
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,930
>> The signal is then propagated.

64
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,460
>> Yes, it goes through this cable and an amplifier we have here, 

65
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,780
because the charge left by an alpha particle in the silicon detector 

66
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,790
is only about a few femtocoulombs and we need to amplify

67
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,510
this signal for detection.

68
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,450
>> Then the experiment is to measure the count rate, the rate

69
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,820
of alpha particles, which have been deflected, depending on the angle 

70
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,100
that the detector made with incident alpha beam.

71
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,930
The target may be varied, it may be gold of different thicknesses, 

72
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,570
and can also be made of other metals, such as iron here, 3 microns

73
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,520
of iron, nickel, a thin foil 3 microns thick, 

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,758
or different thicknesses of gold, as here,

75
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:56,950
a gold foil of half a micron. 

76
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,380
One varies two things: the target, that is to say the Z and the thickness Δx 

77
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,810
of the target in the direction of the beam, and one varies the angle.

78
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,650
How many different angles does one typically measure in an experiment?

79
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,610
>> About a dozen different angles

80
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,180
One puts the detector on both sides of the alpha beam to ensure, 

81
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,620
that we make a symmetric measurement relative to the direction of incident alpha beam.

82
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,920
>> Obviously, the count rate varies very quickly with the angle. 

83
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,860
This is the famous 1/sin^4(θ/2) at work. 

84
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,930
Then, the count rate varies between what and what, roughly?

85
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,920
>> If you make the measurement in the direction of the incident beam, you measure,

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,320
in principle, all the alpha particles from the source,

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,710
those that were scattered to very small angle,

88
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,510
but also those, which have not interacted in target. 

89
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,590
And thus the count rate, in this case, is roughly a few kilohertz. 

90
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,070
So we can measure very quickly and acquire enough events 

91
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,005
in a very short period.

92
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,885
>> This also gives us the intensity of the incident beam.

93
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,585
>> Exactly.

94
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:21,665
Then, to measure the count rate at different scattering angles,

95
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:27,985
we move the silicon detector up to about 30 degrees,
on déplace le détecteur à silicium

96
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:33,820
sometimes 45 degrees, relative to the axis of alpha particles.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,360
It is clear that the count rate drops dramatically

98
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,080
as we vary the angle.

99
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,940
>> What is the 45 degree count rate, roughly?

100
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,970
>> It's very small, one event per minute

101
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,240
so we need to measure over several days to accumulate sufficient statistics.

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
>> On the contrary, at low angles, it is a lot higher, right?

103
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,910
>> A lot higher.

104
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,400
As I said earlier, this is about a few kilohertz at zero angle, 

105
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,640
and at small angles the counting rate is still high.

106
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,780
>> Okay. Then, students spend about 

107
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,730
a day to do this experiment, or a day and a night perhaps?

108
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,390
>> Well, if we measure angles in the direction of the particle, 

109
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,930
the measurement can be done in a few hours.

110
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,290
While when we measure at fairly large angles, 

111
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,160
we leave the experiment running a whole week.

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,130
Students spend the day to start the experiment,

113
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,020
check that all the ingredients are working properly,

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,640
and afterwards the measurement can be taken, as I said, in a week.

115
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,110
So, I put the sensor at zero angle 

116
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,200
to have a significant count rate and see things in real time.

117
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,490
To run the experiment, you need to put all back into vacuum.

118
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:19,090
So we will close the vacuum chamber and switch on the pump again.

119
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,880
>> So, once the chamber is closed, 

120
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,750
the internal pressure drops relatively quickly, and

121
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,935
it is also possible to apply the bias voltage to the silicon diode

122
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:37,035
that is used for counting the passage of particles. 

123
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,945
Here, you use which bias voltage?

124
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:49,800
>> Here we work with 24V, this is due to the thickness. 

125
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,550
Also, one does not need

126
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,750
to deplete the detector completely,

127
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,610
as alpha particles stop within the first few microns of detector thickness.

128
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,100
>> If the first microns are depleted, 

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,140
this is perfectly adequate for accumulating the signal.

130
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,530
So here, we see the signal of alpha particles passing, 

131
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,030
the typical signal curve shown by a silicon detector; 

132
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,659
this is the voltage as a function of time.

133
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,900
>> As I said before, we have a very, very low signal,

134
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,300
a very, very low charge, some femtocoulombs.

135
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,000
So we need a first amplifier

136
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,280
to amplify the signal about 10’000 times,

137
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,410
the signal seen here, so this is a charge amplifier.

138
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,440
That is why we see a signal that rises very quickly, 

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,930
with a much longer decay time.

140
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,860
>> So the method of measurement would trigger a counter once

141
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,840
the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, 

142
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,410
and count the rate of these events 

143
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,750
to measure the interaction rate.

144
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,910
>> Here, actually, we do something a little more sophisticated. 

145
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,250
Instead of only measuring the count rate, we measure the charge

146
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,740
deposited by the alpha particle in the detector, to be sure

147
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,200
that the detected pulse is generated by an alpha particle.

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,480
To do this, we need to go through a second amplifier that will

149
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,480
shape the signal as seen here.

150
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,870
In principle, it converts the signal to almost Gaussian shape,

151
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,440
so it has a slower rise, and afterwards

152
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,120
we use a charge-to-digital converter.

153
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,010
This transforms the signal into something that can be used

154
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,715
with a computer.

155
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:05,350
>> That is to say that we measure the dE/dx of the particles, 

156
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,330
which they leave in the thickness of the detector.

157
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,540
>> Once we have converted the charge to a binary number,

158
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,780
a computer is used to store the data,

159
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,430
i.e. the charge deposited by alpha particles,

160
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,070
and we obtain an energy spectrum of the alpha particles. 

161
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,385
>> Okay.

162
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,245
Because they are completely absorbed, 

163
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,565
it is a kind of miniature calorimeter.

164
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:40,985
But at the same time, one obviously saves

165
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:45,855
the count rate that will give us the Rutherford cross section.

166
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:46,495
>> Exactly.

167
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:50,845
So we must also record the time we used

168
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:56,260
to measure, because it gives us the count rate.

169
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,745
We record a number of pulses and divide by the measurement time.

170
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,574
