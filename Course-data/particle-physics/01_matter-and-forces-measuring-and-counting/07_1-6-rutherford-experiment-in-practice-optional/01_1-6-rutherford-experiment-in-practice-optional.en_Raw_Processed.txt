music to conclude 
first module this course, 
we visit lab course nuclear physics 
university geneva, 
to see one an experiment la rutherford 
i present dr alessandro bravar, a senior lecturer 
in department, is responsible this lab course 
is also an active researcher, like collaborators, is part 
neutrino physics group also experiment, prepares 
to measure detailed properties muons will take place 
in a few years paul scherrer institute in villigen, near zurich 
so in front us we a typical setup a rutherford experiment 
alessandro, you please explain 
ingredients this setup way works 
okay 
here, we try to repeat rutherford measurements, 
modern equipment a technique 
that looks a bit like experiments that we make today to study, 
example, electron structure 
so we have, in case, 
an alpha emitter, emits alpha particles sent to a target, 
we detecting alpha particles scattered target 
indeed, rutherford, first, 
geiger marsden implemented idea 
rutherford interpreted observations geiger marsden 
so to make this experiment, we to work in a vacuum 
this will require to open this box in a moment, to show ingredients 
reason that one works in vacuum, is that we use alpha particles 
alpha particles already stopped 
an air layer ten centimeters 
so that alpha particles propagate source to target 
detector, 
we need to remove air that otherwise would stop particles 
we therefore put in in this box a pump 
that pumps air makes noise you hear 
we will is to stop pump 
open cover to see ingredients experiment 
lets go 
you open valve 
yes, first thing, open valve let air in, 
otherwise we cannot lift cover 
we hear faint sound air entering vacuum chamber 
i think 
this is 
yet we to wait a while 
here we go 
so we open vacuum chamber 
three main components experiment seen 
here we a source americium that emits alpha particles 
alpha particles travel to a target, here 
we use a gold foil a thickness micron 
alpha particles interact gold nuclei 
scattered gold nuclei in different directions 
to detect alpha particles, we use a silicon detector, 
a diode placed in tube here 
we will see silicon detector in a little detail 
thank you martin 
thats silicon detector 
central part we see here is active part detector, 
while rest serves to define acceptance detector 
behind there is a small connector to measure electrical signal 
generated alpha particles, completely absorbed in this detector 
signal is propagated 
yes, goes this cable an amplifier we here, 
charge left an alpha particle in silicon detector 
is a few femtocoulombs we need to amplify 
this signal detection 
experiment is to measure count rate, rate 
alpha particles, deflected, depending angle 
that detector made incident alpha beam 
target may varied, may gold different thicknesses, 
also made metals, iron here, microns 
iron, nickel, a thin foil microns thick, 
different thicknesses gold, here, 
a gold foil half a micron 
one varies two things target, that is to say z thickness x 
target in direction beam, one varies angle 
many different angles one typically measure in an experiment 
a dozen different angles 
one puts detector sides alpha beam to ensure, 
that we make a symmetric measurement relative to direction incident alpha beam 
obviously, count rate varies quickly angle 
this is famous sin work 
then, count rate varies between what, roughly 
if you make measurement in direction incident beam, you measure, 
in principle, alpha particles source, 
that scattered to small angle, 
also those, interacted in target 
thus count rate, in this case, is roughly a few kilohertz 
so we measure quickly acquire enough events 
in a short period 
this also gives us intensity incident beam 
exactly 
then, to measure count rate different scattering angles, 
we move silicon detector to degrees, 
dplace le dtecteur silicium 
sometimes degrees, relative to axis alpha particles 
is clear that count rate drops dramatically 
we vary angle 
is degree count rate, roughly 
small, one event per minute 
so we need to measure several days to accumulate sufficient statistics 
contrary, low angles, is a lot higher, right 
a lot higher 
i said earlier, this is a few kilohertz zero angle, 
small angles counting rate is still high 
okay then, students spend 
a day to this experiment, a day a night perhaps 
well, if we measure angles in direction particle, 
measurement done in a few hours 
while we measure fairly large angles, 
we leave experiment running a whole week 
students spend day to start experiment, 
check that ingredients working properly, 
afterwards measurement taken, i said, in a week 
so, i put sensor zero angle 
to a significant count rate see things in real time 
to run experiment, you need to put back vacuum 
so we will close vacuum chamber switch pump 
so, chamber is closed, 
internal pressure drops relatively quickly, 
is also possible to apply bias voltage to silicon diode 
that is used counting passage particles 
here, you use bias voltage 
here we work v, this is due to thickness 
also, one need 
to deplete detector completely, 
alpha particles stop within first few microns detector thickness 
if first microns depleted, 
this is perfectly adequate accumulating signal 
so here, we see signal alpha particles passing, 
typical signal curve shown a silicon detector 
this is voltage a function time 
i said before, we a very, low signal, 
a very, low charge, femtocoulombs 
so we need a first amplifier 
to amplify signal times, 
signal seen here, so this is a charge amplifier 
that is we see a signal that rises quickly, 
a much longer decay time 
so method measurement would trigger a counter 
voltage exceeds a certain threshold, 
count rate events 
to measure interaction rate 
here, actually, we something a little sophisticated 
instead measuring count rate, we measure charge 
deposited alpha particle in detector, to sure 
that detected pulse is generated an alpha particle 
to this, we need to go a second amplifier that will 
shape signal seen here 
in principle, converts signal to almost gaussian shape, 
so a slower rise, afterwards 
we use a chargetodigital converter 
this transforms signal something that used 
a computer 
that is to say that we measure dedx particles, 
leave in thickness detector 
we converted charge to a binary number, 
a computer is used to store data, 
ie charge deposited alpha particles, 
we obtain an energy spectrum alpha particles 
okay 
completely absorbed, 
is a kind miniature calorimeter 
time, one obviously saves 
count rate that will give us rutherford cross section 
exactly 
so we must also record time we used 
to measure, gives us count rate 
we record a number pulses divide measurement time
