to
conclude
the
first
module
of
this
course
,
we
visit
the
lab
course
on
nuclear
physics
at
university
of
geneva
,
to
see
how
one
does
an
experiment
Ã£Â
la
rutherford
.
i
present
dr.
alessandro
bravar
,
a
senior
lecturer
in
our
department
,
who
is
responsible
for
this
lab
course
.
he
is
also
an
active
researcher
,
like
all
our
collaborators
,
who
is
part
of
our
neutrino
physics
group
and
also
has
his
own
experiment
,
which
he
prepares
to
measure
the
detailed
properties
of
muons
.
it
will
take
place
in
a
few
years
at
the
paul
scherrer
institute
in
villigen
,
near
zurich
.
so
in
front
of
us
we
have
a
typical
set-up
for
a
rutherford
experiment
.
alessandro
,
can
you
please
explain
the
ingredients
of
this
set-up
and
the
way
it
works
?
>
>
okay
.
here
,
we
try
to
repeat
the
rutherford
measurements
,
but
with
modern
equipment
and
a
technique
that
looks
a
bit
like
the
experiments
that
we
make
today
to
study
,
for
example
,
the
electron
structure
.
so
we
have
,
in
our
case
,
an
alpha
emitter
,
which
emits
alpha
particles
sent
to
a
target
,
and
we
are
detecting
alpha
particles
scattered
by
the
target
.
>
>
indeed
,
it
was
not
rutherford
,
who
did
it
first
,
it
was
geiger
and
marsden
who
have
implemented
his
idea
.
>
>
but
it
was
rutherford
who
interpreted
the
observations
of
geiger
and
marsden
.
so
to
make
this
experiment
,
we
have
to
work
in
a
vacuum
.
this
will
require
to
open
this
box
in
a
moment
,
to
show
all
the
ingredients
.
the
reason
that
one
works
in
vacuum
,
is
that
we
use
alpha
particles
and
alpha
particles
are
already
stopped
by
an
air
layer
of
about
ten
centimeters
.
so
that
the
alpha
particles
can
propagate
from
the
source
to
the
target
and
our
detector
,
we
need
to
remove
all
the
air
that
otherwise
would
stop
the
particles
.
we
have
therefore
put
in
in
this
box
with
a
pump
that
pumps
the
air
;
it
makes
the
noise
you
hear
now
.
what
we
will
do
now
is
to
stop
the
pump
and
open
the
cover
to
see
all
the
ingredients
of
the
experiment
.
>
>
let
's
go
.
you
open
the
valve
?
>
>
yes
,
first
thing
,
open
the
valve
and
let
the
air
in
,
otherwise
we
can
not
lift
the
cover
.
>
>
we
hear
the
faint
sound
of
air
entering
the
vacuum
chamber
.
i
think
this
is
it
.
>
>
not
yet
.
we
have
to
wait
a
while
.
here
we
go
.
so
we
open
the
vacuum
chamber
and
the
three
main
components
of
the
experiment
can
be
seen
.
here
we
have
a
source
of
americium
that
emits
alpha
particles
.
alpha
particles
travel
to
a
target
,
here
we
use
a
gold
foil
with
a
thickness
of
1
micron
.
alpha
particles
interact
with
the
gold
nuclei
and
are
scattered
by
the
gold
nuclei
in
different
directions
.
to
detect
these
alpha
particles
,
we
use
a
silicon
detector
,
a
diode
placed
in
the
tube
here
.
we
will
see
the
silicon
detector
in
a
little
more
detail
.
thank
you
martin
.
that
's
our
silicon
detector
.
the
central
part
we
see
here
is
the
active
part
of
the
detector
,
while
the
rest
serves
to
define
the
acceptance
of
the
detector
.
behind
it
there
is
a
small
connector
to
measure
the
electrical
signal
generated
by
alpha
particles
,
which
are
completely
absorbed
in
this
detector
.
>
>
the
signal
is
then
propagated
.
>
>
yes
,
it
goes
through
this
cable
and
an
amplifier
we
have
here
,
because
the
charge
left
by
an
alpha
particle
in
the
silicon
detector
is
only
about
a
few
femtocoulombs
and
we
need
to
amplify
this
signal
for
detection
.
>
>
then
the
experiment
is
to
measure
the
count
rate
,
the
rate
of
alpha
particles
,
which
have
been
deflected
,
depending
on
the
angle
that
the
detector
made
with
incident
alpha
beam
.
the
target
may
be
varied
,
it
may
be
gold
of
different
thicknesses
,
and
can
also
be
made
of
other
metals
,
such
as
iron
here
,
3
microns
of
iron
,
nickel
,
a
thin
foil
3
microns
thick
,
or
different
thicknesses
of
gold
,
as
here
,
a
gold
foil
of
half
a
micron
.
one
varies
two
things
:
the
target
,
that
is
to
say
the
z
and
the
thickness
Ã®Âx
of
the
target
in
the
direction
of
the
beam
,
and
one
varies
the
angle
.
how
many
different
angles
does
one
typically
measure
in
an
experiment
?
>
>
about
a
dozen
different
angles
one
puts
the
detector
on
both
sides
of
the
alpha
beam
to
ensure
,
that
we
make
a
symmetric
measurement
relative
to
the
direction
of
incident
alpha
beam
.
>
>
obviously
,
the
count
rate
varies
very
quickly
with
the
angle
.
this
is
the
famous
1/sin^4
(
Ã®Â¸/2
)
at
work
.
then
,
the
count
rate
varies
between
what
and
what
,
roughly
?
>
>
if
you
make
the
measurement
in
the
direction
of
the
incident
beam
,
you
measure
,
in
principle
,
all
the
alpha
particles
from
the
source
,
those
that
were
scattered
to
very
small
angle
,
but
also
those
,
which
have
not
interacted
in
target
.
and
thus
the
count
rate
,
in
this
case
,
is
roughly
a
few
kilohertz
.
so
we
can
measure
very
quickly
and
acquire
enough
events
in
a
very
short
period
.
>
>
this
also
gives
us
the
intensity
of
the
incident
beam
.
>
>
exactly
.
then
,
to
measure
the
count
rate
at
different
scattering
angles
,
we
move
the
silicon
detector
up
to
about
30
degrees
,
on
dÃ£Â©place
le
dÃ£Â©tecteur
Ã£Â
silicium
sometimes
45
degrees
,
relative
to
the
axis
of
alpha
particles
.
it
is
clear
that
the
count
rate
drops
dramatically
as
we
vary
the
angle
.
>
>
what
is
the
45
degree
count
rate
,
roughly
?
>
>
it
's
very
small
,
one
event
per
minute
so
we
need
to
measure
over
several
days
to
accumulate
sufficient
statistics
.
>
>
on
the
contrary
,
at
low
angles
,
it
is
a
lot
higher
,
right
?
>
>
a
lot
higher
.
as
i
said
earlier
,
this
is
about
a
few
kilohertz
at
zero
angle
,
and
at
small
angles
the
counting
rate
is
still
high
.
>
>
okay
.
then
,
students
spend
about
a
day
to
do
this
experiment
,
or
a
day
and
a
night
perhaps
?
>
>
well
,
if
we
measure
angles
in
the
direction
of
the
particle
,
the
measurement
can
be
done
in
a
few
hours
.
while
when
we
measure
at
fairly
large
angles
,
we
leave
the
experiment
running
a
whole
week
.
students
spend
the
day
to
start
the
experiment
,
check
that
all
the
ingredients
are
working
properly
,
and
afterwards
the
measurement
can
be
taken
,
as
i
said
,
in
a
week
.
so
,
i
put
the
sensor
at
zero
angle
to
have
a
significant
count
rate
and
see
things
in
real
time
.
to
run
the
experiment
,
you
need
to
put
all
back
into
vacuum
.
so
we
will
close
the
vacuum
chamber
and
switch
on
the
pump
again
.
>
>
so
,
once
the
chamber
is
closed
,
the
internal
pressure
drops
relatively
quickly
,
and
it
is
also
possible
to
apply
the
bias
voltage
to
the
silicon
diode
that
is
used
for
counting
the
passage
of
particles
.
here
,
you
use
which
bias
voltage
?
>
>
here
we
work
with
24v
,
this
is
due
to
the
thickness
.
also
,
one
does
not
need
to
deplete
the
detector
completely
,
as
alpha
particles
stop
within
the
first
few
microns
of
detector
thickness
.
>
>
if
the
first
microns
are
depleted
,
this
is
perfectly
adequate
for
accumulating
the
signal
.
so
here
,
we
see
the
signal
of
alpha
particles
passing
,
the
typical
signal
curve
shown
by
a
silicon
detector
;
this
is
the
voltage
as
a
function
of
time
.
>
>
as
i
said
before
,
we
have
a
very
,
very
low
signal
,
a
very
,
very
low
charge
,
some
femtocoulombs
.
so
we
need
a
first
amplifier
to
amplify
the
signal
about
10Ã¢ÂÂ000
times
,
the
signal
seen
here
,
so
this
is
a
charge
amplifier
.
that
is
why
we
see
a
signal
that
rises
very
quickly
,
with
a
much
longer
decay
time
.
>
>
so
the
method
of
measurement
would
trigger
a
counter
once
the
voltage
exceeds
a
certain
threshold
,
and
count
the
rate
of
these
events
to
measure
the
interaction
rate
.
>
>
here
,
actually
,
we
do
something
a
little
more
sophisticated
.
instead
of
only
measuring
the
count
rate
,
we
measure
the
charge
deposited
by
the
alpha
particle
in
the
detector
,
to
be
sure
that
the
detected
pulse
is
generated
by
an
alpha
particle
.
to
do
this
,
we
need
to
go
through
a
second
amplifier
that
will
shape
the
signal
as
seen
here
.
in
principle
,
it
converts
the
signal
to
almost
gaussian
shape
,
so
it
has
a
slower
rise
,
and
afterwards
we
use
a
charge-to-digital
converter
.
this
transforms
the
signal
into
something
that
can
be
used
with
a
computer
.
>
>
that
is
to
say
that
we
measure
the
de/dx
of
the
particles
,
which
they
leave
in
the
thickness
of
the
detector
.
>
>
once
we
have
converted
the
charge
to
a
binary
number
,
a
computer
is
used
to
store
the
data
,
i.e
.
the
charge
deposited
by
alpha
particles
,
and
we
obtain
an
energy
spectrum
of
the
alpha
particles
.
>
>
okay
.
because
they
are
completely
absorbed
,
it
is
a
kind
of
miniature
calorimeter
.
but
at
the
same
time
,
one
obviously
saves
the
count
rate
that
will
give
us
the
rutherford
cross
section
.
>
>
exactly
.
so
we
must
also
record
the
time
we
used
to
measure
,
because
it
gives
us
the
count
rate
.
we
record
a
number
of
pulses
and
divide
by
the
measurement
time
.
