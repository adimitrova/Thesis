this first module, 
we introducing objects studied 
particle physics namely matter, forces 
spacetime also, course, 
reactions between particles 
in this third video, 
we present concept probability, 
to characterize strength 
fundamental forces 
well also define one 
important quantities in 
particle physics, is 
called cross section 
this quantity allows to calculate 
to measure strength 
subatomic reactions 
watching this video, you will 
able to define cross section in terms 
incident flux 
number target particles 
you will also able to relate cross 
section to probability, 
rate a particle reaction 
in quantum physics motion 
fields way interacting 
is described probability 
amplitudes probabilities 
defined in a frequentist 
way multiple measurements 
movement a particular wave 
function psi, describes probability 
amplitude a function spacetime, 
fourmomentum particle, 
namely a function x 
energy e momentum p 
probability density to find 
particle time 
location x, is given square 
wave function psi psi 
integrating this density 
a finite volume 
gives us probability that 
particle is in this volume 
probability amplitude m 
a reaction is joint 
probability amplitude that two 
current densities j 
j meet exchange a virtual photon 
fourmomentum q 
probability reaction is 
given cross section sigma, 
is proportional to square 
amplitude m 
physics particle motion 
particle reactions is thus expressed 
via statistical probabilities 
mathematically speaking, a probability 
is a real number between 
in a frequentist approach, probability 
is defined ratio between number 
desired outcomes an experiment, 
we might call successes, 
number trials 
took to obtain 
in terms physics, this is 
ratio between number times 
an event happens, number 
times could happened 
an event 
example localization 
a particle inside a given volume 
ratio also number 
times a reaction takes place, 
divided number times 
could taken place 
this means in particular that 
reactions always happen 
in fact, we will find that 
happen rather rarely 
probabilities follow 
relatively simple algebra 
purposes suffices to 
know two simple rules 
joint probability 
two independent events 
to happen is product 
individual probabilities 
probability that least one 
two incompatible events happen, 
is sum two properties 
two probabilities, sorry 
incompatible means that two events 
cannot realized time 
rules applied to 
probability amplitudes that we 
introduces earlier 
two limiting cases 
a probability p 
impossible events 
p certain events 
in general, 
we will find that probabilities 
particle reactions 
rather small numbers 
processes follow probabilistic 
laws certain individually, 
still predicted collectively 
this little simulation shows is 
called a galton board an example 
small balls introduced in 
middle top board 
obstacles scatter either left 
right probability 
multiple scatters 
independent other, 
result 
depend a previous one 
bottom board, 
balls show, 
you see, a gaussian distribution 
around middle position 
you know a little 
statistics, this is an example 
chains multiple events 
an arbitrary individual distribution 
boolean in this case 
necessarily boolean 
asymptotically produce 
a gaussian distribution, 
famous bellshaped distribution, 
is perfectly calculable 
characterized two parameters, 
mean width distribution 
let us come back to particle reaction 
particle physics explores matter 
means scattering experiments 
this purpose a beam particles 
is directed towards a target 
one counts number 
scatters take place, 
measures scattered 
particle direction energy 
this sketch shows 
a fictitious situation 
target particle is represented 
a small gray surface 
let us consider a simple model 
a reaction takes place if 
if, a particle hits a gray surface 
let us make assumption that 
distance between target particles 
is large compared to size 
that gray surfaces overlap 
interaction thus stays rare 
in real life this corresponds to 
a target is made a thin foil 
a rarified gas 
number possible 
scatters is evidently 
proportional to flux incoming 
particles, incoming projectiles 
that is to say, 
number per unit time pass 
a perpendicular surface 
number actual scatters is 
proportional to number target 
particles per square meter 
that is to say, 
surface density n 
individual surface sigma 
if fact, probability to 
interact is simply product 
surface density 
surface size sigma 
a small part di initial 
flux i will thus scattered 
rest flux is transmitted 
small fraction scattered 
flux dii is 
thus equal to interaction 
probably n times sigma 
density targets also 
expressed volume density rho, 
if one multiplies infinitesimal 
target thickness, dx 
integrating thickness to 
x, one obtains an exponential law 
attenuation incident flux 
we call sigma cross section 
reaction 
dimension a surface 
nothing to geometrical 
size target particle, rather 
represents probability interaction 
between an individual projectile 
an individual target particle 
crosssection is often measured 
in enormous units one barn 
ten to minus square meters, 
is a large one 
crosssection is, 
thus, a sort probability expressed 
strange units, one must admit 
rules 
probability calculation apply 
if two processes 
independent other, 
probabilities simply add 
one distinguishes, example, 
processes elastic scattering, 
kinetic energy 
projectile change, 
direction changes, 
inelastic scattering, 
projector looses energy 
target particle recoils andor 
changes mass, 
absorption projectile 
simply disappears inside target 
mutually exclusive processes, 
crosssections added to 
form is called a total cross section, 
like in bottom equation this slide 
crosssection must obviously 
a positive real number 
a maximum, 
corresponds to a reaction 
always takes place 
that is called unitarity limit 
an application example is 
calculated in video a, 
deals attenuation 
photons a sheet lead 
result will probably surprise you, 
encourage you hopefully, to 
careful next time you expose 
to a beam energetic photons 
is clear that properties 
outgoing particles also important to 
understand reaction 
example, angle 
projectile is scattered gives useful 
information structure 
target, properties 
interaction well see many 
examples in course lectures 
keeping in mind that crosssection 
nothing to physical size 
target, 
let us continue to imagine 
crosssection an effective area 
interaction 
if projectile hits 
a reaction takes place, 
otherwise projectile 
passes without perturbation 
scattering an infinitesimal 
element domega solid angle, 
centered polar angle theta 
azimuth angle phi, 
comes an element dsigma 
that surface in geometrical model 
fraction incoming beams 
scattered solid element 
is proportional to differential 
cross section, dsigma domega 
probability that a projectile 
is scattered a solid 
angle element is normally uniform 
depends angles theta phi, 
scattering azimuth angle, 
allows one to look 
target in a literal sense 
total cross section is obtained 
integrating differential 
cross section dsigma domega 
solid angle domega 
let us consider a system 
cylindrical symmetry 
scattering probability is independent 
azimuthal angle phi 
depends 
scattering angle theta 
an example classical physics is 
scattering a central force 
shows a fixed relation between 
impact parameter b 
polar scattering angle theta 
projectiles an impact 
parameter between b 
b plus db an initial azimuthal 
angle between phi phi plus dphi, 
scattered an element domega 
around direction theta,phi 
fraction incoming beam 
falls a region is dii 
equal rho times x times b db dphi 
integrating azimuthal 
angle force depend 
we will obtain a factor , 
results defines crosssection 
in terms impact parameter, 
scheduling angle 
taking absolute value 
guarantees that cross section, 
is always a positive definite real number 
scattering angle theta depends 
impact parameter b, in a specific manner, 
is determined, in fact, 
distance law central 
force equivalent potential 
let us take a really trivial example 
classical shock 
between two rigid bodies 
geometry laws elastic 
reflection relate b to thetha, 
in simple geometrical way 
sketched in this little drawing 
differential crosssection 
is constant, 
depend 
scattering angle 
angular distribution 
scattered particles is isotropic 
total cross section is found 
to sigma times r, 
equal to geometrical 
surface target 
surprised to find this result 
we expected in first place 
in next video, mercedes will give 
you a much interesting example 
a realistic 
electromagnetic interaction 
in this case, 
interaction a 
nucleus also known an alpha particle 
a heavy nucleus like gold 
this process is called rutherford scattering,
