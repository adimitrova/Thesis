2
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:13,525
We calculate the attenuation
of a photon beam

3
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:17,130
of energy 1 MeV by a one
centimeter thick lead plate.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,281
The attenuation of the beam intensity I

5
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,450
is exponential with three
factors in the exponent:

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,490
the cross section sigma
between photons and lead nuclei,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,292
the density rho of target nuclei and
the thickness âˆ†x of the target.

8
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:36,545
Let us first consider lead properties.

9
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,525
It's mass density is about 10,000
kilograms per cubic meter.

10
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:43,503
The molecular weight is
0.20 kilogram per mole and

11
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:46,879
the number of nuclei per mole
is given by Avogadro's number.

12
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:54,686
The second major ingredient is the cross section
between 1 MeV photons and lead nuclei.

13
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,570
We get it from the data collected
by the Particle Data Group.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,412
And 1 MeV we find a huge cross
section of about 10 barns.

15
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:08,700
With this we can calculate
the attenuation of the beam.

16
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:16,862
First, the number density of lead nuclei
is approximately 3 times 10^28

17
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:18,330
per cubic meter.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,667
The exponent of the attenuation
law is thus of the order of 0.33.

19
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:27,444
That is to say that the beam is
attenuated by only about 28%.

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,440
There is no less than 72% of the beam

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,100
which passes this one
centimeter thick lead plate,

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,648
despite the enormous cross section.

00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:41,839
