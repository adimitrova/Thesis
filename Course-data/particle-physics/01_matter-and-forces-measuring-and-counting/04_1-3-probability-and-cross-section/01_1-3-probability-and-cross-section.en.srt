2
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:12,879
During this first module,

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,780
we are introducing the objects studied by
particle physics namely matter, forces and

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,280
space-time but also, of course,
reactions between particles.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,010
In this third video,
we present the concept of probability,

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,140
to characterize the strength
of fundamental forces.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,990
We'll also define one of
the most important quantities in

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,680
particle physics, which is
called the cross section.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,740
This quantity allows to calculate and

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,880
to measure the strength
of subatomic reactions.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,800
After watching this video, you will be
able to define the cross section in terms

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,830
of incident flux and
number of target particles.

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,990
You will also be able to relate the cross
section to the probability, and

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,840
the rate of a particle reaction.

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,890
In quantum physics the motion of
fields and their way of interacting

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,150
is described by probability
amplitudes and probabilities themselves.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,320
They are defined in a frequentist
way by multiple measurements.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,330
For the movement of a particular the wave
function psi, describes the probability

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,230
amplitude as a function of space-time,
and the four-momentum of the particle,

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,790
namely as a function of t and x and
of energy E and momentum p.

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,590
The probability density to find
the particle at time t and

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,290
at location x, is given by the square
of the wave function psi* psi.

23
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,240
Integrating this density
over a finite volume

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
gives us the probability that
the particle is in this volume.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,652
The probability amplitude M for
a reaction is the joint

26
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:02,500
probability amplitude that two
current densities j_1 and

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,786
j_2 meet and exchange a virtual photon of
four-momentum q.

28
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:12,394
The probability for the reaction is
then given by the cross section sigma,

29
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:17,748
which is proportional to the square
of the amplitude |M|^2.

30
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:19,836
The physics of particle motion and

31
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:24,230
particle reactions is thus expressed
via statistical probabilities.

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,620
Mathematically speaking, a probability
is a real number between 0 and 1.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,600
In a frequentist approach, the probability
is defined as the ratio between the number

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,150
of desired outcomes of an experiment,
we might call successes, and

35
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,410
the number of trials it
took to obtain them.

36
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,500
In terms of physics, this is
the ratio between the number of times

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,260
an event happens, and the number
of times it could have happened.

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,860
An event can for

39
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,480
example be the localization of
a particle inside a given volume.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
The ratio can also be the number
of times a reaction takes place,

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,050
divided by the number of times
it could have taken place.

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,150
This means in particular that
reactions do not always happen.

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,440
In fact, we will find that
they happen rather rarely.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,220
Probabilities follow their own
relatively simple algebra.

45
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,050
For our purposes it suffices to
know our two simple rules.

46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,250
The joint probability of
two independent events

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,650
to happen is the product of
their individual probabilities.

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,790
The probability that at least one
of two incompatible events happen,

49
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,580
is the sum of the two properties.

50
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,730
The two probabilities, sorry.

51
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,328
Incompatible means that the two events
cannot be realized at the same time.

52
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,509
And all of these rules applied to
the probability amplitudes that we have

53
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,820
introduces earlier.

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,371
The two limiting cases for
a probability are p=0 for

55
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:03,048
impossible events and
p=1 for certain events.

56
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,426
In general,
we will find that probabilities for

57
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:07,750
particle reactions
are rather small numbers.

58
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:19,820
Processes which follow probabilistic
laws are not certain individually,

59
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,930
but can still be predicted collectively.

60
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,360
This little simulation shows what is
called a Galton board as an example.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,250
The small balls are introduced in
the middle at the top of the board.

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,360
The obstacles scatter them either left or
right with 50% probability.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
The multiple scatters
are independent of each other,

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,850
the result does not
depend on a previous one.

65
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,790
At the bottom of the board,
the balls show,

66
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,900
as you can see, a Gaussian distribution
around the middle position.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,093
For those of you who know a little
statistics, this is an example of how

68
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:02,103
chains of multiple events with
an arbitrary individual distribution

69
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:05,649
– Boolean in this case but
not necessarily Boolean –

70
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,320
asymptotically produce
a Gaussian distribution,

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,490
the famous bell-shaped distribution,
which is perfectly calculable and

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,130
characterized by just two parameters, the
mean and the width of the distribution.

73
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,920
But let us come back to particle reaction.

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,760
Particle physics explores matter by
means of scattering experiments.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,890
For this purpose a beam of particles
is directed towards a target.

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,770
One counts the number of
scatters which take place, and

77
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,409
measures the scattered
particle direction and energy.

78
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,540
This sketch shows
a fictitious situation where each

79
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,050
target particle is represented
by a small gray surface.

80
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,330
Let us consider a simple model
where a reaction takes place if and

81
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,830
only if, a particle hits a gray surface.

82
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,570
Let us make the assumption that
the distance between target particles

83
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,770
is large compared to their size such
that the gray surfaces do not overlap.

84
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,140
The interaction thus stays rare.

85
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,770
In real life this corresponds to
a target which is made by a thin foil or

86
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,879
a rarified gas.

87
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,890
The number of possible
scatters is evidently

88
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,270
proportional to the flux of incoming
particles, of incoming projectiles.

89
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,970
That is to say,

90
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,470
their number per unit time which pass
through a perpendicular surface.

91
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,480
The number of actual scatters is
proportional to the number of target

92
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,470
particles per square meter.

93
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,090
That is to say,
the surface density n

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,880
and the individual surface sigma.

95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,180
If fact, the probability to
interact is simply the product

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,045
of the surface density and
the surface size sigma.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,020
A small part dI of the initial
flux I will thus be scattered.

98
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,770
The rest of the flux is just transmitted.

99
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,943
The small fraction of the scattered
flux -dI/I is

100
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:08,030
thus equal to the interaction
probably n times sigma.

101
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,750
The density of targets can also be
expressed as the volume density rho,

102
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,729
if one multiplies by the infinitesimal
target thickness, dx.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,850
Integrating over the thickness up to
∆x, one obtains an exponential law for

104
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,780
the attenuation of the incident flux.

105
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,360
We call sigma the cross section for

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,559
the reaction because it has
the dimension of a surface.

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,400
It has nothing to with the geometrical
size of the target particle, it rather

108
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,180
represents the probability of interaction
between an individual projectile and

109
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,700
an individual target particle.

110
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,370
The cross-section is often measured
in enormous units which are one « barn » 

111
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,250
ten to the minus 28 square meters,
which is a very large one.

112
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,760
The cross-section is,

113
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,990
thus, a sort of probability expressed
by strange units, one must admit.

114
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,880
But the rules for
probability calculation apply.

115
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,190
If two processes
are independent of each other,

116
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,500
the probabilities just simply add up.

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,300
One distinguishes, for example,
processes of elastic scattering,

118
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,420
where the kinetic energy of
the projectile does not change,

119
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,410
just its direction changes,

120
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,950
inelastic scattering,
where the projector looses energy and

121
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,715
the target particle recoils and/or
changes mass, and

122
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:35,560
absorption where the projectile
simply disappears inside the target.

123
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,556
For these mutually exclusive processes,

124
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:44,060
the cross-sections can just be added to
form what is called a total cross section,

125
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,180
like in the bottom equation on this slide.

126
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:54,510
The cross-section must obviously
be a positive real number.

127
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,810
It has a maximum,

128
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,890
which corresponds to a reaction
which always takes place.

129
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,730
That is called the unitarity limit.

130
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,930
An application example is
calculated in video 1.3a,

131
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,630
it deals with the attenuation
of photons by a sheet of lead.

132
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,520
The result will probably surprise you,
and encourage you hopefully, to be very

133
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,907
careful the next time you expose
yourself to a beam of energetic photons.

134
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:25,755
It is clear that the properties of the
outgoing particles are also important to

135
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,450
understand the reaction.

136
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,024
For example, the angle by which
the projectile is scattered gives useful

137
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:36,376
information about the structure of
the target, and the properties of

138
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:41,490
the interaction as we'll see with many
examples in the course of these lectures.

139
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,920
Keeping in mind that the cross-section has
nothing to do with the physical size of

140
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
the target,

141
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,990
let us continue to imagine
the cross-section as an effective area for

142
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,560
the interaction.

143
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,190
If the projectile hits it
a reaction takes place,

144
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,440
otherwise the projectile
passes without perturbation.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,710
The scattering into an infinitesimal
element dOmega of solid angle,

146
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,240
centered on the polar angle theta and
the azimuth angle phi,

147
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,830
then comes from an element dsigma of
that surface in our geometrical model.

148
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,490
The fraction of the incoming beams
scattered into the solid element

149
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,140
is proportional to the differential
cross section, dsigma dOmega.

150
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,530
The probability that a projectile
is scattered into a solid

151
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,050
angle element is not normally uniform.

152
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,720
It depends on the angles theta and phi,
the scattering and the azimuth angle,

153
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,389
and allows one to look into
the target in a literal sense.

154
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,710
The total cross section is obtained
integrating the differential

155
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,120
cross section dsigma dOmega
over the solid angle dOmega.

156
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,310
Let us consider a system
with cylindrical symmetry.

157
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,930
The scattering probability is then independent
of the azimuthal angle phi and

158
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,980
only depends on
the scattering angle theta.

159
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,930
An example from classical physics is
the scattering by a central force.

160
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,800
It shows a fixed relation between
the impact parameter b and

161
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,440
the polar scattering angle theta.

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,690
All projectiles with an impact
parameter between b and

163
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,110
b plus db and an initial azimuthal
angle between phi and phi plus dphi,

164
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,495
are scattered into an element dOmega
around the direction (theta,phi).

165
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,810
The fraction of the incoming beam which
falls into such a region is dI/I

166
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,465
equal rho times ∆x times b db dphi.

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,410
Integrating over the azimuthal
angle on which the force does not depend

168
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,640
we will just obtain a factor of 2π,
and the results defines the cross-section

169
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,280
in terms of impact parameter,
and the scheduling angle.

170
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,270
Taking the absolute value
guarantees that the cross section,

171
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,850
is always a positive definite real number.

172
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,660
The scattering angle theta depends on the
impact parameter b, in a specific manner,

173
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,860
which is determined, in fact,

174
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,140
by the distance law of the central
force or its equivalent potential.

175
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,950
Let us take a really trivial example:

176
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,110
the classical shock
between two rigid bodies.

177
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,940
The geometry and the laws of elastic
reflection relate b to thetha,

178
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,250
in the simple geometrical way
sketched in this little drawing.

179
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,270
The differential cross-section
is just constant,

180
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,260
it does not depend on
the scattering angle.

181
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,610
The angular distribution of
the scattered particles is isotropic.

182
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,520
The total cross section is found
to be sigma times πR^2,

183
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,900
equal to the geometrical
surface of the target and

184
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,420
we're not surprised to find this result
which we expected in the first place.

185
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,090
In the next video, Mercedes will give
you a much more interesting example

186
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,750
of a realistic
electromagnetic interaction.

187
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,220
In this case,
the interaction of a He-4

188
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,460
nucleus also known as an alpha particle
with a heavy nucleus like gold.

189
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,243
This process is called Rutherford scattering,
its experimental observation has

190
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,984
revealed the existence
of the atomic nucleus.

191
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:17,739
