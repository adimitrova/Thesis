we calculate attenuation 
a photon beam 
energy mev a one 
centimeter thick lead plate 
attenuation beam intensity i 
is exponential three 
factors in exponent 
cross section sigma 
between photons lead nuclei, 
density rho target nuclei 
thickness x target 
let us first consider lead properties 
mass density is , 
kilograms per cubic meter 
molecular weight is 
kilogram per mole 
number nuclei per mole 
is given avogadros number 
second major ingredient is cross section 
between mev photons lead nuclei 
we get data collected 
particle data group 
mev we find a huge cross 
section barns 
this we calculate 
attenuation beam 
first, number density lead nuclei 
is approximately times 
per cubic meter 
exponent attenuation 
law is thus order 
that is to say that beam is 
attenuated 
there is less beam 
passes this one 
centimeter thick lead plate, 
despite enormous cross section
