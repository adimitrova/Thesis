00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,987
In the beginning of last century,
Geiger and

3
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:15,202
Marsden have measured
the Rutherford reaction.

4
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:18,375
They have counted scatters by eye.

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,454
In this little video we will convince
ourselves that this is indeed possible.

6
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:26,955
Geiger and Marsden took a source
of polonium 210, an alpha emitter

7
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:31,534
collimated to an intensity of
about 1,000 particles per second,

8
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:35,750
which scattered off a gold foil
of 100 nanometers thickness.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,280
And they counted the number of scatters
per second by eye at angle of ten degrees at

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,560
a distance of ten centimeters and over
an area of about one square centimeter.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,518
Let us first compute
the properties of gold.

12
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:54,807
It has a density of about 2 times 10^4
kilogram per cubic meter.

13
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:59,829
Its charge is 79 and
its mass is 197 atomic units which gives

14
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,797
us a number density of about 0.6 times 10^29 
nuclei per cubic meter.

15
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:14,378
Alpha particles are He-4 nuclei
with charge 2 to 4 mass units and

16
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:20,050
an initial intensity of 10^3 per
second comes out of the collimator.

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,577
The cross section for Rutherford
scattering is proportional to the product of the two

18
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:29,481
charges squared inversely proportional
to the incident energy squared and

19
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:32,586
the sin^4 of half
the scattering angle.

20
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,867
Using the correct conversion factors,

21
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:38,957
we thus obtain a differential cross
section at an angle of 10 degrees of

22
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:42,456
2 times 10^-24 square meters steradian.

23
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:47,443
This corresponds to a fraction of the
initial intensity of about 1.3 per mil,

24
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:50,466
which is scattered into
the observed solid angle.

25
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:56,245
That is to say the count rate is about 1.3 Hz,
easily observable by the naked eye.

26
00:01:56,245 --> 00:02:02,534
