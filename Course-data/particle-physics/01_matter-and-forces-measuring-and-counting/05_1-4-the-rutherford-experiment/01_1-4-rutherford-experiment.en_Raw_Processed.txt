this first model we introducing 
objects studies in particle physics, so 
matter, forces spacetime 
in this forth video we give an example 
calculating 
measuring a crosssection 
rutherford experiment 
this is scattering process 
demonstrated existence 
atomic nucleus we know today 
goals to apply 
concept crosssection, 
in a process that treated 
in a semiclassical manner 
to compute an interaction rate 
characteristics an experiment 
we will use a seminal 
experiment to demonstrate, 
crosssection 
serves to understand

discovered electron in 
this model described 
atom a homogeneous positive 
substance in electrons embedded 
thus a modest charge density 
in this case, alpha particles, 
much smaller atoms, 
able to penetrate foil 
minor perturbation 
if hand, atom consists 
a tiny, dense, positively charged 
nucleus surrounded electrons to 
fill atomic volume, proposed 
rutherford, larger scattering 
angles would possible 
we seen in previous video, 
classical calculation a cross 
section requires to find relation 
between impact parameter b 
scattering angle theta 
we will calculate relation 
non relativistic velocities 
incident alpha particle 
we base this calculation three laws 
first one is newtons law 
relates rate momentum 
changes to coulomb force between 
projectile target nucleus 
is quoted here using variables 
indicated in sketch right 
second law is conservation 
kinetic energy, 
characteristic elastic scattering 
a heavy target, 
recoil hit projectile 
third one is conservation 
angular momentum introduces 
angular velocity dgammadt 
combining three equations we 
obtain relation between impact 
parameter b scattering angle theta, 
we looking 
if you interested in 
details calculation, 
we refer you to video a 
inserting result general 
relation classical crosssection, 
we obtained differential crosssection 
coulomb interaction 
a point like heavy target 
cross section is proportional to 
square products two charges 
z z 
this factor determines order 
magnitude cross section 
cross section is strongly peaked in 
forward direction according to 
sintheta to fourth power, 
inversely proportional to square 
kinetic energy projectile 
factors due to propagator 
photon exchanged between two 
reaction partners 
basic properties indeed 
experimentally established geiger marsden 
counting impact 
scattered alpha particles 
a screen covered 
zink sulfate 
this molecule emits a small flash 
light hit a charged particle 
experimenters counted flashes 
watching screen a microscope 
is realistic to count 
scatters eye in a setup 
small video b will convince 
you actually calculating rate 
so procedure to measure a 
cross section is thus clear 
one must count rate 
interactions per second 
that we need a detector 
a distance r 
covering a surface 
r domega 
one must normalize counting 
rate maximum possible 
interaction rate to obtain a probability 
maximum rate is obtained every 
projectile interacts target 
is thus product 
incident rate 
surface density 
target particles 
also expressed 
flux projectiles 
multiplied number target 
particles covered incident beam 
proportionality factor 
between counted rated 
maximum counted rate 
is cross section 
proportionality factor 
between counting rate 
cross section is called luminosity 
in laboratory frame 
target is rest is given 
rate incoming beam times 
surface density target particles 
if you want to use volume density 
target you multiply target 
thickness 
in center mass frame, two 
beams collide headon like in a collider, 
luminosity is proportional to 
population two beams, 
na nb, to 
frequency f cross 
is inversely proportional 
to common surface two beams 
counting rate 
luminosity thus depend details 
experiment that we conducting 
ratio, cross section, 
characterizes physical 
process independent details 
until we considered 
processes using tool 
kit classical physics 
we already know that 
this is sufficient 
in next video we will show quantum 
physics approaches scattering processes 
we will introduce 
an indispensable tool kit particle
