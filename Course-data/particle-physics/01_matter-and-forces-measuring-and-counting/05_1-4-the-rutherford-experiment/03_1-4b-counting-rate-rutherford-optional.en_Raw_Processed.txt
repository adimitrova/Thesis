in beginning last century, 
geiger 
marsden measured 
rutherford reaction 
counted scatters eye 
in this little video we will convince 
that this is indeed possible 
geiger marsden took a source 
polonium , an alpha emitter 
collimated to an intensity 
, particles per second, 
scattered a gold foil 
nanometers thickness 
counted number scatters 
per second eye angle ten degrees 
a distance ten centimeters 
an area one square centimeter 
let us first compute 
properties gold 
a density times 
kilogram per cubic meter 
charge is 
mass is atomic units gives 
us a number density times 
nuclei per cubic meter 
alpha particles nuclei 
charge to mass units 
an initial intensity per 
second comes collimator 
cross section rutherford 
scattering is proportional to product two 
charges squared inversely proportional 
to incident energy squared 
sin half 
scattering angle 
using correct conversion factors, 
we thus obtain a differential cross 
section an angle degrees 
times square meters steradian 
this corresponds to a fraction 
initial intensity per mil, 
is scattered 
observed solid angle 
that is to say count rate is hz, 
easily observable naked eye
