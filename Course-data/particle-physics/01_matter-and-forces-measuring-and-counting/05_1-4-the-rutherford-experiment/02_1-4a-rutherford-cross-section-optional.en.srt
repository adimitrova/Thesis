2
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:16,252
We will calculate with classical arguments 
à la Rutherford the cross section of a small

3
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:21,044
nucleus of charge z scattering
of a heavy nucleus of charge Z.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,865
The basis of this calculation, is
the relationship between the differential

5
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:35,170
cross-section and the dependence of the
impact parameter b on the scattering angle theta.

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,619
First we use the fact that
the kinetic energy is conserved, and

7
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,678
that, as there is no recoil of the target,
the initial and

8
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,298
the final projectile
velocities are the same.

9
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:51,536
In the same way,
the angular momentum will be conserved,

10
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:54,580
which tells us that mvb is a constant.

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,874
This means that dgamma/dt can be
expressed in terms of the initial

12
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,741
velocity of the projecile,
the impact parameter and

13
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,611
the distance squared between
projectile and target.

14
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,203
This serves to express the Coulomb force,

15
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:11,486
which is just the product of the two
charges divided by 4 pi r^2,

16
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:15,260
times the unit vector which connects
the projectile and the target,

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,535
in terms of what we know that is to say,
the projectile velocity and

18
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:19,323
the impact parameter.

19
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:31,749
When we integrate this relationship
between gamma = 0 and gamma = pi-theta,

20
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:36,457
one side is the vector difference between
the final and initial velocities.

21
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:40,731
The other side is the integral over
the relationship we just obtained.

22
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:50,345
With a little trigonometry, we get – rather
painfully – the value of this integral.

23
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:06,473
In particular, we obtain that the integral
of the unit vector between the initial and

24
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,332
final states, is = 2 cos(theta/2).

25
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,684
On the other hand,
simple trigonometry gives us

26
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:27,966
a relationship between the length
of the vector difference

27
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,639
between final and initial velocity and

28
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,861
the scattering angle,
which turns out to be 2 v sin/theta/2).

29
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,640
The two relationships together
finally give us the relationship

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,911
between impact parameter and
the scattering angle we have been looking for.

31
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:54,053
We then insert this result
into our formula for

32
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,121
the differential cross section.

33
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:07,164
After some simplification,
we finally obtain the Rutherford formula for

34
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:09,950
the differential cross
section of the process.

35
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,768
It tells us that there is
a very steep angular dependent,

36
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:17,782
inversely proportional to
sin^4(theta/2).
