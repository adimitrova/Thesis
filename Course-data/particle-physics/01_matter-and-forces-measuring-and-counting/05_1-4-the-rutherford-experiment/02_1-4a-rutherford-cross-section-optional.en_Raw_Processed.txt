we will calculate classical arguments 
la rutherford cross section a small 
nucleus charge z scattering 
a heavy nucleus charge z 
basis this calculation, is 
relationship between differential 
crosssection dependence 
impact parameter b scattering angle theta 
first we use fact that 
kinetic energy is conserved, 
that, there is recoil target, 
initial 
final projectile 
velocities 
in way, 
angular momentum will conserved, 
tells us that mvb is a constant 
this means that dgammadt 
expressed in terms initial 
velocity projecile, 
impact parameter 
distance squared between 
projectile target 
this serves to express coulomb force, 
is product two 
charges divided pi r, 
times unit vector connects 
projectile target, 
in terms we know that is to say, 
projectile velocity 
impact parameter 
we integrate this relationship 
between gamma gamma pitheta, 
one side is vector difference between 
final initial velocities 
side is integral 
relationship we obtained 
a little trigonometry, we get rather 
painfully value this integral 
in particular, we obtain that integral 
unit vector between initial 
final states, is costheta 
hand, 
simple trigonometry gives us 
a relationship between length 
vector difference 
between final initial velocity 
scattering angle, 
turns to v sintheta 
two relationships together 
finally give us relationship 
between impact parameter 
scattering angle we looking 
we insert this result 
formula 
differential cross section 
simplification, 
we finally obtain rutherford formula 
differential cross 
section process 
tells us that there is 
a steep angular dependent, 
inversely proportional to 
sintheta
