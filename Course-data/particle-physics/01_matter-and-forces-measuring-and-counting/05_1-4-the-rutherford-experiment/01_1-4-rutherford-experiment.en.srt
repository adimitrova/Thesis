2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
During this first model we are introducing
the objects studies in particle physics, so 

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,891
matter, forces and space-time.

4
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:22,250
In this forth video we give an example.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,140
for calculating and

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,760
measuring a cross-section for
the Rutherford experiment.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,530
This is the scattering process
which demonstrated the existence

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,520
of the atomic nucleus as we know it today.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,374
The goals are to apply
the concept of cross-section,

10
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:43,745
in a process that can be treated
in a semi-classical manner.

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:50,565
And to compute an interaction rate from
the characteristics of an experiment.

12
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:53,304
We will use a seminal
experiment to demonstrate,

13
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,400
how the cross-section
serves to understand

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,020
The unknow subatomic
structure of a target.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,000
Geiger and Marsden measured in
1909 the angular distribution of

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,070
alpha particles 
– fully ionized He-4 –

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,500
scattering off thin foils of
heavy metal like gold.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,930
The preferred model of the time for
the nucleus and for

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,600
the atoms was due to Thomson 
who had discovered the electron in 1897.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,747
This model described
the atom as a homogeneous positive

21
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:32,220
substance in which electrons are embedded.

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,520
It thus has a very modest charge density.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,720
In this case, the alpha particles,
being much smaller than atoms,

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,740
should be able to penetrate the foil
with only minor perturbation.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,100
If on the other hand, the atom consists
of a tiny, dense, and positively charged

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,410
nucleus surrounded by electrons to
fill the atomic volume, as proposed

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:01,730
by Rutherford, larger scattering
angles would be possible.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,455
As we have seen in the previous video,
the classical calculation of a cross

29
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:11,030
section requires to find the relation
between the impact parameter b and

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,843
the scattering angle theta.

31
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,337
We will calculate the relation for

32
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:19,607
non relativistic velocities of
the incident alpha particle.

33
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,330
We base this calculation on three laws.

34
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,607
The first one is Newton's law which
relates the rate at which the momentum

35
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,473
changes to the Coulomb force between
projectile and target nucleus.

36
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:36,700
It is quoted here using the variables
indicated in the sketch on the right.

37
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,730
The second law is the conservation
of kinetic energy,

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,550
characteristic for elastic scattering
on a heavy target, which does

39
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,450
not recoil when hit by the projectile.

40
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,092
The third one is the conservation
of angular momentum which introduces

41
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:57,603
the angular velocity dgamma/dt.

42
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:02,128
Combining these three equations we
obtain the relation between the impact

43
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:06,380
parameter b and the scattering angle theta,
which we are looking for.

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,668
If you are interested in
the details of the calculation,

45
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,270
we refer you to the video 1.4a.

46
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,757
Inserting our result into the general

47
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,349
relation for the classical cross-section,
we obtained the differential cross-section for

48
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,900
the Coulomb interaction with
a point like heavy target.

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,698
The cross section is proportional to
the square products of the two charges

50
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:42,860
(z Z)^2.

51
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,210
This factor determines the order
of magnitude of the cross section.

52
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,360
The cross section is strongly peaked in
the forward direction according to

53
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,350
1/sin(theta/2) to the fourth power,

54
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:06,450
and inversely proportional to the square
of the kinetic energy of the projectile.

55
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,690
These factors are due to the propagator
of the photon exchanged between the two

56
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,590
reaction partners.

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,699
These basic properties have indeed been
experimentally established by Geiger and Marsden

58
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,734
counting the impact of
the scattered alpha particles

59
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:29,030
on a screen covered
by zink sulfate.

60
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,012
This molecule emits a small flash of
light when hit by a charged particle.

61
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:38,770
The experimenters counted these flashes by
watching the screen through a microscope.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,247
Is it realistic to count
scatters by eye in such a setup?

63
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:51,570
The small video 1.4b will convince
you by actually calculating the rate.

64
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,348
So the procedure to measure a 
cross section is thus clear.

65
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,860
One must count the rate of
interactions per second.

66
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,911
For that we need a detector
at a distance r

67
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,141
covering a surface
r^2 dOmega.

68
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,751
One must then normalize the counting
rate by the maximum possible

69
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,120
interaction rate to obtain a probability.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,690
The maximum rate is obtained when every
projectile interacts with the target.

71
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,810
It is thus the product of
the incident rate and

72
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,210
the surface density of
the target particles.

73
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,240
It can also be expressed
by the flux of projectiles

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,920
multiplied by the number of target
particles covered by the incident beam.

75
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,775
The proportionality factor
between the counted rated and

76
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,598
the maximum counted rate
is the cross section.

77
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:49,852
The proportionality factor
between counting rate and

78
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:53,150
cross section is called luminosity.

79
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,250
In the laboratory frame where
the target is at rest it is given

80
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,250
by the rate of the incoming beam times
the surface density of target particles.

81
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,960
If you want to use the volume density of
the target you multiply by the target

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,480
thickness.

83
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:15,230
In the center of mass frame, where two
beams collide head-on like in a collider,

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,350
the luminosity is proportional to
the population of the two beams,

85
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,700
n_a and n_b, and to
the frequency f at which they cross.

86
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,238
And it is inversely proportional
to the common surface S of the two beams.

87
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:35,467
Counting rate and

88
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:41,533
luminosity thus depend on the details of
the experiment that we are conducting.

89
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:46,636
Their ratio, the cross section,
characterizes the physical

90
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:51,842
process independent of these details. 
Until now we have only considered

91
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:57,100
processes using the tool
kit of classical physics.

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,970
But we already know that
this is not sufficient.

93
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,960
In the next video we will show how quantum
physics approaches scattering processes.

94
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,938
Further on we will introduce
an indispensable tool kit of particle

95
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,046
physics, Feynman diagrams.
