this course is going to give you a global 
overview modern subatomic physics 
in order to follow easily, would 
good if you basic notion 
classical mechanics 
classical electrodynamics 
you must also able to understand 
appreciate a simple mathematical formula, 
including simple differential 
integral equations 
if you educational 
level a thirdyear student 
scientific discipline, you 
right level to follow this course 
would also good if you basic 
notion restricted relativity 
quantum mechanics 
in case, will give you 
a quick reminder this notion 
specific vocabulary 
we will cover atomic nucleus, 
structure properties, 
put to practical use 
we will guide you 
techniques to create, accelerate, 
detect particles 
measure properties 
fundamental particles, 
namely quarks leptons, 
will discussed in a lot detail 
amount detail, 
fundamental forces will also 
discussed, well properties 
we will complete tour is 
called standard model particle 
physics discussing higgs boson 
prevents particles 
moving speed light 
we will go beyond 
discuss we search 
new physics beyond is 
already well understood 
that way you will understand 
use formidable machine, 
lhc cern, 
experiments 
experiments using 
particles like cosmic rays, 
manmade 

you will understand dark matter 
dark energy contribute to 
forming universe we live in 
end this course, 
you will able to answer questions 
friends subatomic world 
you will well prepared 
to continue studies 
so again, welcome to course, 
particle physics, an introduction
