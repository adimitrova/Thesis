2
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:15,450
This course is going to give you a global
overview of modern subatomic physics.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,049
In order to follow it easily, it would
be good if you had basic notion of

4
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:22,360
classical mechanics and
classical electrodynamics.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,440
You must also be able to understand and
appreciate a simple mathematical formula,

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,150
including simple differential and
integral equations.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,470
>> If you have the educational
level of a third-year student of

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,090
any scientific discipline, then you have
the right level to follow this course.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,010
>> It would also be good if you had basic
notion on the restricted relativity and

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,400
quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,950
But in any case, it will give you
a quick reminder of this notion and

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,460
the specific vocabulary.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,250
>> We will cover the atomic nucleus,
its structure and its properties, and

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,840
how they are put to practical use.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,370
>> We will guide you through
techniques to create, accelerate,

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,310
and detect particles and
measure their properties.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,590
>> The fundamental particles,
namely the quarks and leptons,

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,990
will be discussed in a lot of detail.

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,150
With the same amount of detail,

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,560
the fundamental forces will also be
discussed, as well as their properties.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,510
>> We will complete our tour of what is
called the Standard Model of particle

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,160
physics by discussing the Higgs boson.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,590
Which prevents the particles from
moving at the speed of light.

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,150
>> We will go beyond and
discuss how we search for

25
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,910
new physics beyond what is
already well understood.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,702
That way you will understand
the use of the formidable machine,

27
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:38,410
such as the LHC of CERN,
and it's experiments.

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,710
>> But those experiments are using
the particles like cosmic rays,

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,600
which are not manmade.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,087
>> And
you will understand how dark matter and

31
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:49,553
dark energy contribute to
forming the universe we live in.

32
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:50,997
At the end of this course,

33
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:55,539
you will be able to answer questions from
your friends about the subatomic world.

34
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,550
And you will be well prepared
to continue your studies.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,771
So once again, welcome to the course,
Particle Physics, An Introduction.
