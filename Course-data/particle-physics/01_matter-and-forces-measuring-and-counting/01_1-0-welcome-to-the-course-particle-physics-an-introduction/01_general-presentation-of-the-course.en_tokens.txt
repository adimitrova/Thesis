this
course
is
going
to
give
you
a
global
overview
of
modern
subatomic
physics
.
in
order
to
follow
it
easily
,
it
would
be
good
if
you
had
basic
notion
of
classical
mechanics
and
classical
electrodynamics
.
you
must
also
be
able
to
understand
and
appreciate
a
simple
mathematical
formula
,
including
simple
differential
and
integral
equations
.
>
>
if
you
have
the
educational
level
of
a
third-year
student
of
any
scientific
discipline
,
then
you
have
the
right
level
to
follow
this
course
.
>
>
it
would
also
be
good
if
you
had
basic
notion
on
the
restricted
relativity
and
quantum
mechanics
.
but
in
any
case
,
it
will
give
you
a
quick
reminder
of
this
notion
and
the
specific
vocabulary
.
>
>
we
will
cover
the
atomic
nucleus
,
its
structure
and
its
properties
,
and
how
they
are
put
to
practical
use
.
>
>
we
will
guide
you
through
techniques
to
create
,
accelerate
,
and
detect
particles
and
measure
their
properties
.
>
>
the
fundamental
particles
,
namely
the
quarks
and
leptons
,
will
be
discussed
in
a
lot
of
detail
.
with
the
same
amount
of
detail
,
the
fundamental
forces
will
also
be
discussed
,
as
well
as
their
properties
.
>
>
we
will
complete
our
tour
of
what
is
called
the
standard
model
of
particle
physics
by
discussing
the
higgs
boson
.
which
prevents
the
particles
from
moving
at
the
speed
of
light
.
>
>
we
will
go
beyond
and
discuss
how
we
search
for
new
physics
beyond
what
is
already
well
understood
.
that
way
you
will
understand
the
use
of
the
formidable
machine
,
such
as
the
lhc
of
cern
,
and
it
's
experiments
.
>
>
but
those
experiments
are
using
the
particles
like
cosmic
rays
,
which
are
not
manmade
.
>
>
and
you
will
understand
how
dark
matter
and
dark
energy
contribute
to
forming
the
universe
we
live
in
.
at
the
end
of
this
course
,
you
will
be
able
to
answer
questions
from
your
friends
about
the
subatomic
world
.
and
you
will
be
well
prepared
to
continue
your
studies
.
so
once
again
,
welcome
to
the
course
,
particle
physics
,
an
introduction
.
