for
those
who
do
not
feel
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
concept
of
virtual
particles
,
we
propose
a
small
review
of
the
phenomenon
.
in
a
field
theory
,
the
field
,
or
rather
the
potential
is
created
by
emitting
a
vector
boson
,
which
has
a
certain
probability
of
traveling
to
its
destination
.
we
will
compute
a
small
example
coming
from
electromagnetic
interactions
.
consider
an
electron
which
enters
with
an
energy
e
and
a
momentum
vector
p.
it
emits
a
photon
with
an
energy
k_0
and
a
momentum
vector
k
,
and
thus
,
changes
its
energy
to
eÃ¢ÂÂ
and
its
momentum
to
pÃ¢ÂÂ
.
the
energy-momentum
four-vector
must
be
the
same
before
and
after
the
emission
of
the
photon
,
and
in
particular
the
square
of
its
length
must
be
the
same
before
and
after
.
on
the
left
,
we
get
the
mass
of
the
electron
squared
,
and
on
the
right
,
the
expression
i
'm
writing
down
here
.
on
the
right
,
we
obtain
,
thus
,
the
mass
of
the
electron
squared
,
plus
the
mass
of
the
photon
squared
,
plus
a
mixed
term
.
the
mass
of
the
electron
cancels
on
the
two
sides
,
and
the
mass
of
the
photon
is
0.
one
obtains
,
thus
,
a
relationship
between
outgoing
energy
and
outgoing
momentum
,
which
is
in
conflict
with
reality
,
because
the
energy
becomes
smaller
or
equal
to
the
momentum
.
but
the
outgoing
photon
did
not
necessarily
have
a
0
mass
.
it
can
be
a
virtual
photon
,
which
is
the
mass
squared
that
i
'm
now
writing
down
.
it
is
not
equal
to
0
,
indeed
it
can
even
be
negative
.
it
is
clear
that
such
a
virtual
particle
can
not
propagate
in
space
and
time
.
i
just
remind
you
that
the
feynman
diagrams
are
defined
in
energy-momentum
space
.
everything
you
see
in
the
feynman
diagram
happens
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
place
.
so
we
must
,
of
course
,
immediately
reabsorb
the
virtual
particle
by
another
pair
of
real
particles
,
as
shown
in
this
diagram
.
there
's
a
second
current
consisting
of
an
electron
,
which
by
entering
and
exiting
a
second
vertex
,
will
absorb
the
photon
.
