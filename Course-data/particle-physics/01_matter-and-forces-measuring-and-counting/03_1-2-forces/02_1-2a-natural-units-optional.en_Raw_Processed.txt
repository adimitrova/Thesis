unfamiliar 
notion natural units, 
we will briefly introduce 
in this short video 
high energy physics 
deals relativistic quantum processes 
scale action is 
planck constant hbar 
scale velocity is given 
speed light, c 
in system natural 
units we set hbar c 
this means that we define 
hbar unit action 
c unit velocity 
in a system second is equal to 
approximately x meters 
an added value electric 
charge is dimensionless 
often shows fine 
structure constant alpha, 
is electrostatic potential 
energy two electrons unit distance, 
divided mass electron 
this constant is equal to 
to a good approximation 
system natural units is 
great practical value since 
eliminates a lot 
constants equations 
make less heavy 
easy to understand 
basic unit, electronvolt, 
is defined gain in energy 
an electron traverses 
potential difference v 
in system natural units, 
electronvolt is common 
unit energy, momentum mass 
a billion units correspond 
roughly to mass proton, 
thus sets natural 
scale energy physics 
whenever you want to convert a result 
to units international systems, 
you need to multiply a combination
