00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:18,013
In this short video,
we will remind you of special relativity and the notation

3
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:25,393
of four-vectors which are essential tools
to work with in high energy physics.

4
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:30,404
This course will treat phenomena at high energy,

5
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,610
so at a velocity which requires
a relativistic treatment.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,880
The fundamental principles of
special relativity which have been

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,760
based on experimental findings are
that the speed of light c is constant at

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,790
the same value in every inertial frame.

9
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:54,990
It means that the Galilean way of adding
velocity is not valid at high speeds.

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,060
This way, the speed of light is
a maximum velocity which cannot

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,420
be exceeded in any frame.

12
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:06,730
Motion is described in a 
four-dimensional space, called space-time.

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,460
An event in space-time is localized
by the Carthesian coordinates ct,

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,870
where t is the time, and
x, where x is the position.

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,290
And this is described by a four-vector x_µ.

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,135
The metric of space time is
defined by the speed of light c,

17
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:29,220
invariant constant in
every inertial frame.

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,368
So suppose that a light
ray connects two events.

19
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:39,210
(ct_1,x_1) and (ct_2,x2).

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,620
The distance between these two points
in space is always proportional

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,930
to the propagation time of the light.

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,480
Since the proportionality constant,
the speed of light, is the same in every

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,500
inertial frame, it follows that the norm
s of a four-vector is also constant.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,666
Lorentz transformations
describe the rotations and

25
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:07,448
translations in space-time which
are compatible with these principles.

26
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:12,280
Let us specify Lorentz
transformation by a simple example.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,970
Let S and S’ be two reference frames.

28
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,560
The first one is at rest
in the laboratory.

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,320
The second one moves relative to
the first one at a constant velocity v

30
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,890
in the direction of the x axis,
which are parallel for the two frames.

31
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,000
Which are the coordinates of
one point in the moving system,

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,640
so t’ and x’,

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,760
expressed in the coordinates of
the laboratory frame, t and x?

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,179
The answer is given by the Lorentz
transformation which relates

35
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,312
t’ and x’ to t and x,

36
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:52,398
by the relative velocity, beta, which
is the ratio between the velocity v and

37
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:56,182
the speed of light c, and
the relativistic factor gamma.

38
00:02:56,182 --> 00:03:02,178
The transformation corresponds to a rotation
in space-time which leaves the norm of

39
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:04,494
four-vectors like x_µ invariant.

40
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:09,138
The transformation involves only
the time coordinate t and the

41
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:12,479
spatial coordinate x along the 
direction of motion.

42
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,985
The coordinates orthogonal to
the motion, y and z, are left untouched.

43
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:24,094
In the non-relativistic
limit that is beta << 1

44
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:29,730
and gamma, which approaches 1,

45
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,385
the Lorentz transformation
reproduces the Galilean

46
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:41,038
transformation where t’
is equal simply to t,

47
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:46,179
and x’ is simply equal
to x - vt.

48
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:51,490
Four-vector notation unites
time and space coordinates in a single vector.

49
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,240
Four-vectors transforming like the
four-vector x^µ of space-time

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,660
under Lorentz transformations
are called the contravariant.

51
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:08,074
An important example is the contravariant
energy-momentum vector p^µ.

52
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:12,893
The norm of a four-vector is
defined via the scalar product

53
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:17,904
between the contravariant four-vector and
its covariant form.

54
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:22,930
The two are related by the metric
tensor g_µnu, as shown here.

55
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,298
All scalar products between four-vectors are
invariant under Lorentz transformations.

56
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:36,564
More generally, the scalar product is
thus defined as the product between

57
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:39,850
a covariant and
a contravariant four-vector.

58
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,422
When the same Greek index shows up
in the two, implicit summation over this index,

59
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,222
which runs from zero to three, is assumed.

60
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:54,039
The first example here repeats the norm
squared of the space-time four-vector.

61
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,493
The second example shows the norm of the
energy-momentum four-vector,

62
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:01,830
which is the square of the invariant mass.

63
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,780
The third example 

64
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,020
Is a scalar product between the 
space-time and the energy-momentum

65
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,470
four-vectors, which shows up in
the wave function of particles.

66
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,390
The scalar products between
four-vectors are all indeed scalars

67
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,450
under Lorentz transformation so
are invariant,

68
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,990
when one changes from one
inertial frame to another.

69
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,768
The notation simplifies if we
adopt the system of natural units,

70
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:35,133
since the ubiquitous
speed of light c disappears.

71
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:41,648
Two other important examples of
four-vectors are the four-vector of

72
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,170
electromagnetic current density, j^µ,

73
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,810
which has the charge density 
rho as the time-like component,

74
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,657
and the vector current density
j as the space-like component.

75
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:58,570
The four-vector of
the electromagnetic potential A^µ,

76
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,250
which has the electric potential V
as a time-like component

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,670
and the magnetic vector-potential
A as the space-like component.

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,057
As an example, we calculate here the total
available energy in the collision of

79
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:19,780
a 200 GeV electron with a proton
at rest in the laboratory frame.

80
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,201
And we confront the results with
a collision in the center of mass frame,

81
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:30,172
where a 200 GeV electron collides
with a 200 GeV proton.

82
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:35,179
>> As

83
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:40,322
an example we calculate
the kinematics of a two

84
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:47,140
body process in the laboratory and
the center of mass frame.

85
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,347
In the laboratory frame a particle of mass
m impacts on a particle of mass

86
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:52,430
M at rest.

87
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,782
We calculate the total energy-
momentum vector in this frame as well

88
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,890
as the square of its length, s.

89
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,020
When one neglects all masses in the system
one obtains that the maximum invariant

90
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,770
mass which can be produced is
equal to square root of 2EM.

91
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,402
In our numerical example
this corresponds to 14GeV.

92
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:21,162
In the center of mass frame on the
contrary the two particles impact on each

93
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,574
other with equal and opposite momenta.

94
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:28,006
The same calculation leads us to
an invariant mass which can be produced,

95
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:32,380
which is two times the energy of either
particle or 200 GeV in our example.
