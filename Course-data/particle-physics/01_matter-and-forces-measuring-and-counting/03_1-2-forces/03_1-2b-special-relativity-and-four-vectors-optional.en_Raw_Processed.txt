in this short video, 
we will remind you special relativity notation 
fourvectors essential tools 
to work in high energy physics 
this course will treat phenomena high energy, 
so a velocity requires 
a relativistic treatment 
fundamental principles 
special relativity 
based experimental findings 
that speed light c is constant 
value in every inertial frame 
means that galilean way adding 
velocity is valid high speeds 
this way, speed light is 
a maximum velocity cannot 
exceeded in frame 
motion is described in a 
fourdimensional space, called spacetime 
an event in spacetime is localized 
carthesian coordinates ct, 
is time, 
x, x is position 
this is described a fourvector x 
metric space time is 
defined speed light c, 
invariant constant in 
every inertial frame 
so suppose that a light 
ray connects two events 
ct,x ct,x 
distance between two points 
in space is always proportional 
to propagation time light 
since proportionality constant, 
speed light, is in every 
inertial frame, follows that norm 
a fourvector is also constant 
lorentz transformations 
describe rotations 
translations in spacetime 
compatible principles 
let us specify lorentz 
transformation a simple example 
let two reference frames 
first one is rest 
in laboratory 
second one moves relative to 
first one a constant velocity v 
in direction x axis, 
parallel two frames 
coordinates 
one point in moving system, 
so x, 
expressed in coordinates 
laboratory frame, x 
answer is given lorentz 
transformation relates 
x to x, 
relative velocity, beta, 
is ratio between velocity v 
speed light c, 
relativistic factor gamma 
transformation corresponds to a rotation 
in spacetime leaves norm 
fourvectors like x invariant 
transformation involves 
time coordinate 
spatial coordinate x along 
direction motion 
coordinates orthogonal to 
motion, y z, left untouched 
in nonrelativistic 
limit that is beta 
gamma, approaches , 
lorentz transformation 
reproduces galilean 
transformation 
is equal simply to t, 
x is simply equal 
to x vt 
fourvector notation unites 
time space coordinates in a single vector 
fourvectors transforming like 
fourvector x spacetime 
lorentz transformations 
called contravariant 
an important example is contravariant 
energymomentum vector p 
norm a fourvector is 
defined via scalar product 
between contravariant fourvector 
covariant form 
two related metric 
tensor gnu, shown here 
scalar products between fourvectors 
invariant lorentz transformations 
generally, scalar product is 
thus defined product between 
a covariant 
a contravariant fourvector 
greek index shows 
in two, implicit summation this index, 
runs zero to three, is assumed 
first example here repeats norm 
squared spacetime fourvector 
second example shows norm 
energymomentum fourvector, 
is square invariant mass 
third example 
is a scalar product between 
spacetime energymomentum 
fourvectors, shows in 
wave function particles 
scalar products between 
fourvectors indeed scalars 
lorentz transformation so 
invariant, 
one changes one 
inertial frame to another 
notation simplifies if we 
adopt system natural units, 
since ubiquitous 
speed light c disappears 
two important examples 
fourvectors fourvector 
electromagnetic current density, j, 
charge density 
rho timelike component, 
vector current density 
j spacelike component 
fourvector 
electromagnetic potential a, 
electric potential v 
a timelike component 
magnetic vectorpotential 
a spacelike component 
an example, we calculate here total 
available energy in collision 
a gev electron a proton 
rest in laboratory frame 
we confront results 
a collision in center mass frame, 
a gev electron collides 
a gev proton 

an example we calculate 
kinematics a two 
body process in laboratory 
center mass frame 
in laboratory frame a particle mass 
m impacts a particle mass 
m rest 
we calculate total energy 
momentum vector in this frame well 
square length, 
one neglects masses in system 
one obtains that maximum invariant 
mass produced is 
equal to square root em 
in numerical example 
this corresponds to gev 
in center mass frame 
contrary two particles impact 
equal opposite momenta 
calculation leads us to 
an invariant mass produced, 
is two times energy either
