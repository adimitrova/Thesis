music 
in this first module, we introducing 
objects studied in particle physics, 
namely matter, forces spacetime 
in this video, we will take 
a quick tour elementary forces, 
action subatomic level 
watching this video, you 
able to name forces 
associated charges, to know 
particles transmit forces, 
know difference between real 
virtual particles 
here is a table comparing 
elementary interactions 
note vast differences between 
respective strengths ranges 
strong force acts between quarks 
particles containing quarks 
a large strength 
a short range 
is transmitted gluons 
electromagnetic force concerns 
particles carrying an electric charge, 
a modest strength an infinite 
range, is transmitted photons 
weak force concerns 
matter particles 
a low strength 
long distances 
becomes comparable to electromagnetic 
force short distances 
is transmitted w z bosons 
gravitational force is weaker 
three acts particles 
large mass 
astronomic objects, 
gravitational force dominates 
evolution universe cosmological scales, 
is however, 
negligible subatomic scales 
we dont know this force 
acts scales 
we dont know if is quantized 
three forces 
note also that strength 
forces depends distance 
equivalently momentum transfer 
we will discuss this fact 
forces separately distance 
laws 
forces quite different 
so forces transmitted 
exchange bosons spin 
photon electromagnetic 
interactions, w 
z bosons weak forces 
gluons strong force 
bosons collectively 
called gauge bosons 
particles emit absorb a boson 
if carry required charge 
to emit a photon, 
an electric charge is required 
concept charge is 
limited to electric charge 
a particle must a nonzero weak 
isospin to emit a w a z boson 
a color charge 
to emit a gluon 
higgs boson is entry 
in this table, a spin 
role is to keep particles 
moving speed light, 
this applies to particles, 
even to higgs boson 
exceptions photons, 
always move speed light, 
however 
confined to bound states 
between quarks we will 
discuss in module 
so, transmission forces 
via exchange particles work 
to understand this, 
we need to recall forces act in 
classical quantum physics 
classical physics deal 
action forces 
particles described mass points 
position x 
momentum p known certainty 
motion is a smooth curve, 
in space a function time, 
we call a trajectory 
is determined newtons law, 
we know vector 
sum forces acting, initial 
conditions position velocity 
action forces is continuous, 
thus trajectory is a smooth curve 
number particles is conserved, 
mass points cannot disappear appear 
field potential notions subordinate to 
central ones force energy 
we give here example 
electric force 
energy related to potential 
shown in last equation 
this description is wrong 
all, 
allows you to drive car 
that validity is limited 
to nonrelativistic velocities 
distances, much larger 
size an atom 
to talk subatomic 
systems high energies, 
we need to go beyond classical physics 
quantum mechanics radically 
changes approach 
particles fields described 
a probability amplitude psi, is 
a function position x time 
t, is also called a wave function 
square this amplitude rho, 
must always positive definite 
gives probability density to find 
particle time in position x 
this density is a probability 
per unit volume 
trajectory 
exist small scales 
multiple measurements position 
a particle form a smooth curve 
probability amplitude 
probability 
evolve starting initial state, 
described schrdinger equation 
particles interact potential, 
action potential is continuous 
however, origin 
potential remains unexplained 
even though action potential 
is continuous implemented 
a sequence pointlike 
interactions in a pertubative approach 
number particles is conserved, 
since probability amplitudes 
follow a continuity equation shown 
bottom page 
this law relates local probability 
density rho to flux density j 
if probability density 
diminishes a certain place, 
there must a divergent 
flux place 
so flux j is thus a 
flux probability density 
validity quantum mechanics is 
limited to non relatively velocity, 
since schrdinger equation 
is covariant, 
forms depends reference frame 
to overcome this limitation, 
we to use relativistic field theory 
here, we going to introduce 
language, concepts 
results, 
we will use in a formal way 
evolution particles is described 
a relativistic equation motion, 
kleingordon equation, 
is covariant contains 
scalars lorentz transformations 
number particles is 
longer conserved 
electromagnetic current density is 
this current is analogous to 
probability current, 
is proportional to charge 
e particle 
this conservation means that 
is electrical charge, 
is locally conserved, 
number particles 
this allows to describe creation 
charged particles in pairs 
particleantiparticle 
potential longer comes nowhere, 
is generated 
a second current density j 
according to maxwells laws 
fourpotential a is generated 
current density j 
means propagator 
q 
this quantity describes 
probability amplitude 
exchange a photon invariant 
mass q between two currents 
follow carefully may 
noticed that there least three 
unfamiliar notions, in formulae 
that come relativistic field theory 
dimensions quantities 
seem to fit 
in first equation, there is 
a relation between a quantity 
is an energy, a momentum 
another quantity is a mass, 
different 
units in international system 
we familiar 
even worse in second equation, 
since psi dimension, 
first time dimension 
s, 
second m, 
third kg 
solution to this apparent 
inconsistency is use natural units 
secondly, notation j 
p mean 
this is notation used fourvectors, 
implicit summation greek 
indices in scalar products 
finally, last equation 
requires photon nonzero mass 
real photon course zero mass 
all, moves speed light 
solution is notion 
virtual particles, 
is central to action 
forces in field theory 
virtual particles 
properties real ones, 
except that 
a different mass, 
even negative 
imaginary 
we will introduce three notions in 
videos a, b, c, one one 
in next video, 
we will explain probability 
a reaction between particles to happen 
is expressed cross section
