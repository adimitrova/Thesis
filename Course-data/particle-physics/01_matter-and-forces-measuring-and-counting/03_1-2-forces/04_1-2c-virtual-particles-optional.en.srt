00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,797
For those who do not feel sufficiently
familiar with the concept of virtual

3
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:17,731
particles, we propose a small review
of the phenomenon. 

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:22,097
In a field theory, the field, or rather the potential
is created by emitting a vector boson,

5
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:25,760
which has a certain probability
of traveling to its destination.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,300
We will compute a small example coming
from electromagnetic interactions.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,848
Consider an electron which enters with
an energy E and a momentum vector p.

8
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:38,534
It emits a photon with an energy k_0 and
a momentum vector k,

9
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:42,760
and thus, changes its energy to E’
and its momentum to p’.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,300
The energy-momentum 
four-vector must be the same before and

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,830
after the emission of the photon, and

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,500
in particular the square of its length
must be the same before and after.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,450
On the left, we get the mass
of the electron squared, and

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,460
on the right,
the expression I'm writing down here.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,910
On the right, we obtain, thus,
the mass of the electron squared,

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,450
plus the mass of the photon squared,
plus a mixed term.

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,295
The mass of the electron cancels on the two
sides, and the mass of the photon is 0.

18
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:14,588
One obtains, thus, a relationship
between outgoing energy and

19
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,359
outgoing momentum,
which is in conflict with reality,

20
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,380
because the energy becomes smaller or
equal to the momentum.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,949
But the outgoing photon did
not necessarily have a 0 mass.

22
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:29,180
It can be a virtual photon, which is the
mass squared that I'm now writing down.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,220
It is not equal to 0,
indeed it can even be negative.

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,395
It is clear that such a virtual particle
cannot propagate in space and time.

25
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,185
I just remind you that the Feynman
diagrams are defined in

26
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,090
energy-momentum space.

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,350
Everything you see in the Feynman
diagram happens at the same time and

28
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,989
in the same place.

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,980
So we must, of course,
immediately reabsorb the virtual

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,230
particle by another pair of real
particles, as shown in this diagram.

31
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,864
There's a second current consisting
of an electron, which by entering and

32
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,260
exiting a second vertex,
will absorb the photon.

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,429
