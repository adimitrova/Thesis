00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,584
For those unfamiliar with
the notion of natural units,

3
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:19,482
we will briefly introduce
it in this short video.

4
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:27,150
High energy physics
deals with relativistic quantum processes.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,990
The scale of the action is
the Planck constant hbar and

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,750
the scale of velocity is given
by the speed of light, c.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,920
In the system of natural
units we set hbar = c = 1.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,860
This means that we define 
hbar as the unit of action and

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,100
c as the unit of velocity.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,430
In such a system 1 second is equal to
approximately 3 x 10^8 meters.

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,909
As an added value the electric
charge is now dimensionless.

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,670
It often shows up as the fine
structure constant alpha,

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,990
which is the electrostatic potential
energy of two electrons at unit distance,

14
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,770
divided by the mass of the electron.

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,510
This constant is equal to 1/137 
to a good approximation.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,008
The system of natural units is of
great practical value since it

17
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:26,110
eliminates a lot of
constants from equations.

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,810
It does make them less heavy and
more easy to understand.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,719
The basic unit, the electronvolt,
is defined as the gain in energy of

20
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,795
an electron when it traverses
the potential difference of 1V.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,610
In the system on natural units,

22
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,790
the electronvolt is the common
unit of energy, momentum and mass.

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,300
A billion of these units correspond
roughly to the mass of the proton,

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,210
and thus sets the natural
scale of energy physics.

25
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,038
Whenever you want to convert a result
to units of the international systems,

26
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:10,202
you need to multiply by a combination
of hbar and c as shown in this table.
