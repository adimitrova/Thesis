feel sufficiently 
familiar concept virtual 
particles, we propose a small review 
phenomenon 
in a field theory, field, rather potential 
is created emitting a vector boson, 
a certain probability 
traveling to destination 
we will compute a small example coming 
electromagnetic interactions 
consider an electron enters 
an energy e a momentum vector p 
emits a photon an energy k 
a momentum vector k, 
thus, changes energy to e 
momentum to p 
energymomentum 
fourvector must 
emission photon, 
in particular square length 
must 
left, we get mass 
electron squared, 
right, 
expression im writing here 
right, we obtain, thus, 
mass electron squared, 
plus mass photon squared, 
plus a mixed term 
mass electron cancels two 
sides, mass photon is 
one obtains, thus, a relationship 
between outgoing energy 
outgoing momentum, 
is in conflict reality, 
energy becomes smaller 
equal to momentum 
outgoing photon 
necessarily a mass 
a virtual photon, is 
mass squared that im writing 
is equal to , 
indeed even negative 
is clear that a virtual particle 
cannot propagate in space time 
i remind you that feynman 
diagrams defined in 
energymomentum space 
everything you see in feynman 
diagram happens time 
in place 
so we must, course, 
immediately reabsorb virtual 
particle another pair real 
particles, shown in this diagram 
theres a second current consisting 
an electron, entering 
exiting a second vertex, 
will absorb photon
