2
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:16,916
In this first module, we are introducing
the objects studied in particle physics,

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,481
namely matter, forces and space-time.

4
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:24,203
In this video, we will take
a quick tour of elementary forces,

5
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:27,067
and their action at the subatomic level.

6
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:32,159
After watching this video, you should
be able to name these forces and

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,942
their associated charges, to know
the particles which transmit these forces,

8
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:42,447
and know the difference between real and
virtual particles.

9
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:46,090
Here is a table comparing
elementary interactions.

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,474
Note the vast differences between
their respective strengths and ranges.

11
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:55,400
The strong force acts between quarks and
particles containing quarks.

12
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,320
It has a large strength but
a very short range.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,913
It is transmitted by gluons.

14
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:07,399
The electromagnetic force concerns all
particles carrying an electric charge, and

15
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:13,470
it has a modest strength but an infinite
range, and it is transmitted by photons.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,090
The weak force concerns
all matter particles.

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,871
It has a low strength
at long distances but

18
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,651
becomes comparable to the electromagnetic
force at short distances.

19
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:27,720
It is transmitted by the W and Z bosons.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,150
The gravitational force is weaker than
these three but acts on all particles.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,710
Because of the large mass
of astronomic objects,

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,730
the gravitational force dominates
the evolution of the Universe at cosmological scales,

23
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,920
but is however,
negligible at the subatomic scales.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,930
We don't know how this force
acts at these scales and

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,910
we don't know if it is quantized
as the other three forces.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,907
Note also that the strength of
the forces depends on distance or

27
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,970
equivalently on momentum transfer.

28
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,720
We will discuss this fact for each
forces separately because the distance

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,290
laws for
these forces are quite different.

30
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,627
So forces are transmitted by
exchange of bosons of spin 1.

31
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:27,762
The photon for electromagnetic 
interactions, the W± and

32
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:32,630
the Z bosons for the weak forces and
gluons for the strong force.

33
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,622
These bosons are collectively
called gauge bosons.

34
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:42,820
Particles can emit or absorb such a boson
if they carry the required charge.

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,136
To emit a photon,
an electric charge is required.

36
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:53,130
But the concept of charge is not
limited to electric charge.

37
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,707
A particle must have a non-zero weak
isospin to emit a W or a Z boson.

38
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,990
And a color charge
to emit a gluon.

39
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:07,535
The Higgs boson is the only entry
in this table, which has a spin 0.

40
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:12,160
Its role is to keep particles from
moving at the speed of light, and

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,310
this applies to all particles,
even to the Higgs boson itself.

42
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,295
The only exceptions are the photons,
which always move at the speed of light,

43
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:27,807
and which are however
confined to bound states

44
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:32,570
between quarks as we will
discuss in module 5.

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:39,470
So, how does the transmission of forces
via the exchange of particles work?

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,470
To understand this,

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,580
we need to recall how forces act in
classical and quantum physics.

48
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,080
How does classical physics deal
with the action of forces?

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,390
Particles are described as mass points.

50
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,870
Their position x and
momentum p can be known with certainty.

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,600
Their motion is a smooth curve,
in space a function of time,

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,370
which we call a trajectory.

53
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,114
It is determined by Newton's law,
once we know the vector

54
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:15,190
sum of all forces acting, and the initial
conditions on the position and velocity.

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,680
The action of forces is continuous,
thus the trajectory is a smooth curve.

56
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,960
The number of particles is conserved,

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
mass points cannot disappear or appear.

58
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:32,630
Field and potential are notions which are subordinate to
the central ones of force and energy.

59
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,060
We give here the example for
the electric force and

60
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,980
energy which are related to the potential
as shown in the last equation.

61
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,580
This description is not wrong.

62
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,660
After all,
it allows you to drive your car.

63
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,650
It's just that its validity is limited
to non-relativistic velocities and

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,670
distances, much larger
than the size of an atom.

65
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,550
To talk about subatomic
systems at high energies,

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,630
we need to go beyond classical physics.

67
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,150
Quantum mechanics radically
changes the approach.

68
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,850
Particles are fields described by
a probability amplitude psi, which is

69
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,920
a function of the position x and the time
t, which is also called a wave function.

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,955
The square of this amplitude rho,
which must be always positive definite

71
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:31,970
gives the probability density to find the
particle at the time t in the position x.

72
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,870
This density is a probability
per unit volume.

73
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,100
The trajectory does not
exist at small scales.

74
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,540
Multiple measurements of the position of
a particle do not form a smooth curve.

75
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,570
Probability amplitude and
probability itself

76
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,187
evolve starting from initial state,
described it by the Schrödinger equation.

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,246
Particles interact with the potential,
the action the potential is continuous.

78
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:09,825
However, the origin of
the potential remains unexplained.

79
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:14,894
Even though the action the potential
is continuous it can be implemented

80
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:19,570
as a sequence of point-like
interactions in a pertubative approach.

81
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,087
The number of particles is conserved,
since probability amplitudes

82
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:31,060
follow a continuity equation as shown 
at the bottom of the page.

83
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:39,035
This law relates the local probability
density rho to the flux density j.

84
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:43,135
If the probability density
diminishes at a certain place,

85
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:46,265
there must be a divergent
flux at the same place.

86
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:53,040
So the flux j is thus a 
flux of probability density.

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,840
The validity of Quantum Mechanics is
limited to non relatively velocity,

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,466
since the Schrödinger equation
is not covariant,

89
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:05,250
its forms depends on the reference frame.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,540
To overcome this limitation,
we have to use relativistic field theory.

91
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,020
Here, we are going just to introduce
its language, its concepts and

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,860
its results, but
we will not use it in a formal way.

93
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,420
The evolution of particles is described
by a relativistic equation of motion,

94
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,420
the Klein-Gordon equation,

95
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,090
which is covariant because it contains
only scalars under Lorentz transformations.

96
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,830
The number of particles is
no longer conserved about

97
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,620
the electromagnetic current density is.

98
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,200
This current is analogous to
the probability current, but

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,590
is proportional to the charge
e of the particle.

100
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,384
This conservation means that it
is the electrical charge,

101
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:55,344
which is locally conserved,
and not the number of particles.

102
00:07:55,344 --> 00:08:00,312
This allows to describe the creation
of charged particles in pairs of

103
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,490
particle-antiparticle.

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,235
The potential no longer comes out of nowhere,

105
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,810
but is generated
by a second current density j_2

106
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,230
according to Maxwell's laws.

107
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,410
The four-potential A^µ is generated
by the current density j^µ

108
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,310
by means of the propagator
1/q^2.

109
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,801
This quantity describes
the probability amplitude for

110
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:32,566
the exchange of a photon of invariant
mass q between the two currents.

111
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:40,413
Those who follow carefully may have
noticed that there are at least three

112
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:45,400
unfamiliar notions, in the formulae 
that come with relativistic field theory.

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,205
The dimensions of the quantities
do not seem to fit.

114
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,174
In the first equation, there is

115
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:57,392
a relation between a quantity
which is an energy, a momentum and

116
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:02,412
another quantity which is a mass,
which have all different

117
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:07,150
units in the international system
which we are familiar with.

118
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,030
Even worse in the second equation,
since psi has no dimension,

119
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,550
the first time has dimension
1/s^2,

120
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,643
the second 1/m^2,
and the third kg^2.

121
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:32,840
The solution to this apparent
inconsistency is the use of natural units.

122
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,705
Secondly, what does the notation j^µ and
p^µ mean?

123
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,610
This is the notation used for four-vectors,

124
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,960
with implicit summation over Greek
indices in scalar products.

125
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,478
Finally, the last equation
requires the the photon has non-zero mass.

126
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:58,147
The real photon of course has zero mass.

127
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:01,470
After all, it moves at the speed of light.

128
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,040
The solution is the notion
of your virtual particles,

129
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,532
which is central to the action
of forces in field theory.

130
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:12,920
Virtual particles have all the same
properties as the real ones,

131
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,090
except that they can
have a different mass,

132
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,900
which can even be negative or
imaginary.

133
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:31,301
We will introduce these three notions in
the videos 1.2a, b, and c, one by one.

134
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:36,164
In the next video,
we will explain how the probability for

135
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:42,428
a reaction between particles to happen
is expressed by the cross section.

136
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:48,509
