hello, welcome to introductory 
course subatomic physics brought to 
you university geneva 
this first module, we will give an 
overview objects that treated 
particle physics, namely matter, 
forces spacetime 
we will also discuss one goes 
to characterize strength 
a reaction between particles 
concept cross section 
is a central issue subject 
end module, 
we will visit laboratory 
nuclear physics course university 
geneva to see a small example 
this works in practice 
in this first video, 
we will take a quick tour elements 
matter subatomic level 
watched this video, you 
know quarks leptons name 
a few fundamental properties 
you able to assign 
constituents to families generations 
you know quantum numbers 
conserved in interactions 
among particles 
we interested in this course in 
subatomic structure matter 
here is a schematic picture 
components an atom 
course is to scale otherwise, 
nucleus would completely invisible 
atom consists a positively charged 
nucleus small size order 
ten to minus fourteen meters in 
surrounding electron cloud is 
ten thousand times larger that is to say, 
ten to minus ten meters in radius 
negatively charged 
we know, electron is 
an elementary particle, without internal 
structure probably without size 
belongs to family leptons 
electrons nucleus bound 
together electromagnetic force 
nucleus hand, 
is elementary 
contains protons neutrons 
bound together nuclear force 
we will talk physics 
atomic nucleus in next module 
protons 
neutrons elementary either 
contain quarks bound 
together strong force 
far we tell today, 
quarks equally elementary in 
sense electrons 
careful, this 
describes universe, 
rest is dark matter dark energy, 
we will introduce you to 
two forms matter 
energy in module number eight 
one assign quarks leptons to 
families according to properties, 
to generations according to 
mass shown in this table 
lepton families shown left 
charged leptons similar 
properties electron, 
is wellknown 
member this family 
electric charge is minus one 
elementary charge 
neutral leptons, neutrinos, 
produced in radioactive decays 
zero electric charge 
theyre small mass 
quarks families shown 
right this table 
constituents proton 
neutron 
particles we call hadrons 
there also two types 
uptype quarks an electric 
charge elementary charge, 
downtype quarks 
a charge e 
every family three generations, almost 
identical copies first one, 
a lot heavier first one 
in first generation, 
we find familiar electron, 
light neutrino nul, 
quarks u d, 
constituents 
ordinary matter around us today 
second generation, muon , 
medium mass neutrino num, 
charm quark 
strange quark, c 
finally, in third 
generation we find tau lepton, 
heavy neutrino nuh, 
top bottom quarks, b 
there is a quantum number 
is called flavor 
distinguishes between 
generations inside family 
is conserved interactions 
except weak interactions 
range masses in this table is very, 
large 
neutrinos lightest matter particles 
masses found 
experimentally to two electron 
volts probably rather in 
range milli electron volts mev 
we will talk in module , 
covers weak interactions 
top quark a mass 
large a hafnium nucleus 
hafnium nucleus 
an atomic number 
positive electric charges 
far we know top quark 
is a pointlike particle like 
others in this table 
constituents we 
implement an order scheme, 
a descriptive nomenclature, 
la lin 
we call hadrons 
particles contain quarks 
sensitive to strong 
nuclear reactions, leptons 
baryons bound states 
formed three quarks 
mesons contain a quark an antiquark 
two together form 
we call hadrons 
nucleons p n lightest baryons 
form atomic 
nuclei we find around us 
particles like pion 
lightest mesons formed quarks 
antiquarks 
there hadrons including a top 
quark short lifetime 
this quark decays ever 
form a bound state others 
leptons right this 
table elementary in sense 
that composed 
particles we know 
observations compatible 
size, thus pointlike so 
quarks 
hadrons 
we will often see neutrinos, nue, 
numu nutau in tables this sort 
i dont adhere to this 
particles, nue, numu nutau 
mixtures true particles 
a specific mass we denote nul, 
num nuh in this course 
ww thus respect mass hierarchy 
assign to respective 
generations according to that property 
like we particles 
enormous strength 
strong force binds together, 
quarks to form stable bound states 
to sensitive to strong force, 
particles need to necessary 
charge, is called color charge 
quarks color charge, 
leptons 
this leads to a whole zoology 
hadrons shown in this summary table 
particle data group is responsible 
to collect data concerning 
properties, an exhaustive list states 
well a summary known 
properties is available site 
particle data group quoted in 
red bottom slide 
left you see a list 
baryons containing three quarks 
like proton 
is a uud bound state 
neutron 
is a dud bound state 
right is a list meson formed 
quarks, quark antiquark pairs, 
like positive pion 
is a udbar bound state 
leptons sensitive to strong 
force carry 
necessary color charge 
intreact only, 
via electromagnetic 
weak forces form long lasting 
bound states among 
heres a table summarizing important 
properties elementary particles 
in upper half table you 
find constituents matter 
leptons quarks 
spin one half you see 
in lower half you find 
particles that transmit forces 
bosons integer spin 
charges indicated in units 
an elementary charge one them, 
like one electron in 
case electric charge 
here we say that charge 
is means that is 
times elementary charge, e 
weak charge is called weak isospin 
two components 
in contrast to electromagnetic 
charge one component 
we denote t, 
total length weak isospin 
third component 
this charge depends orientation 
spin particle respect to 
direction motion, means 
depends helicity particle 
strong charge three components 
called color, we use 
abbreviation r red, g green, 
b blue to denote 
color is a property quarks 
gluons latter even carry 
a color an anticolor simultaneously 
every particle, theres an 
antiparticle mass 
charges opposite, 
indicated in this red table 
charges additive quantum numbers 
a system particles 
total charge is sum 
charges constituents 
there quantum 
numbers that conserved 
first one quoted here is 
total number baryons, 
ie number baryons minus 
number anti baryons in a system 
this number is conserved, 
this applies in particular to quarks 
a baryon number , 
antiquarks 
a baryon number minus 
total lepton number, number 
leptons minus number 
antileptons is also constant 
in a closed system 
to a certain extent this is even 
true generation generation 
neutrinos show here, 
nue, numu 
nutau mixtures true particles, 
nul, num nuh 
so, theres mixture between 
generations in weak interactions 
important that, 
charges types rigorously 
conserved far we know 
this evidently concerns electric 
charge q that you familiar 
also weak isospin 
t, color charges r, g, b 
flavor distinguishes 
between generations is a special case 
is conserved strong 
electromagnetic interactions 
altered weak one 
we will define exactly 
means to conserve a quantum number 
we discuss feynman diagrams, 
in part , 
first this module, 
later in video a 
in next video mercedes 
will introduce in detail 
forces interact 
between matter particles
