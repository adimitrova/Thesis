2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:16,245
Hello, and welcome to our introductory
course on subatomic physics brought to

3
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,039
you by University of Geneva.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,330
During this first module, we will give an
overview of the objects that are treated

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,430
by particle physics, namely matter,
forces and space-time.

6
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,453
We will also discuss how one goes
about to characterize the strength of

7
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:41,060
a reaction between particles with
the concept of the cross section.

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,520
Which is a central issue of our subject.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,790
At the end of the module,

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,110
we will visit the laboratory of the
nuclear physics course at University of

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,350
Geneva to see a small example of
how all of this works in practice.

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,590
In this first video,

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,560
we will take a quick tour of the elements
of matter at the subatomic level.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,700
After having watched this video, you
should know quarks and leptons by name and

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,340
a few of their fundamental properties.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,060
You should be able to assign these
constituents to families and generations.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
And you should know the quantum numbers
which are conserved in interactions

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,088
among these particles.

19
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:27,800
We are interested in this course in
the subatomic structure of matter.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,080
Here is a schematic picture
of the components of an atom.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,890
Of course it is not to scale otherwise,
the nucleus would be completely invisible.

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,740
The atom consists of a positively charged
nucleus of small size of the order of

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,980
ten to the minus fourteen meters in the
surrounding electron cloud which is about

24
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,970
ten thousand times larger that is to say,
ten to the minus ten meters in radius and

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,640
negatively charged.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,570
For all we know, the electron is
an elementary particle, without internal

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,320
structure and probably without size.
It belongs to the family of leptons.

28
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,830
Electrons and the nucleus are bound
together by the electromagnetic force.

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,030
The nucleus on the other hand,
is not elementary.

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,580
It contains protons and neutrons
bound together by the nuclear force.

31
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,990
We will talk about the physics of
the atomic nucleus in the next module.

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,900
Protons and
neutrons are not elementary either.

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,890
They contain quarks bound
together by the strong force.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,670
As far as we can tell today,

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,250
quarks are equally elementary in
the same sense as electrons are.

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,523
But be careful, all of this
describes just 5% of the universe,

37
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:39,340
the rest is dark matter and dark energy,
and we will introduce you to these

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,779
two forms of matter and
energy in module number eight.

39
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:50,578
One can assign quarks and leptons to
families according to their properties,

40
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:54,460
and to generations according to
their mass as shown in this table.

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,170
The lepton families are shown on the left.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,480
All charged leptons have similar
properties as the electron,

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,430
which is the most well-known
member of this family.

44
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,950
The electric charge is minus one
elementary charge.

45
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,520
The neutral leptons, the neutrinos,
are produced in radioactive decays.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,110
They have zero electric charge and
they're very small mass.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,230
The quarks families are shown
on the right of this table.

48
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,840
These are the constituents of proton and
neutron and

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,850
of all particles which we call hadrons.

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,300
There are also two types.

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,730
The up-type quarks have an electric
charge of 2/3 of the elementary charge,

52
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,040
the down-type quarks
have a charge of -1/3e.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,390
Every family has three generations, almost
identical copies of the first one, but

54
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,740
a lot heavier than the first one.

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,550
In the first generation,
we find the familiar electron,

56
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,110
the light neutrino nu_L,
the quarks up and down u and d,

57
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,300
these are the constituents of
the ordinary matter around us today.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,190
The second generation, has the muon µ,
the medium mass neutrino nu_M,

59
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,900
the charm quark and
the strange quark, c and s.

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,780
And finally, in the third
generation we find the tau lepton,

61
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,530
the heavy neutrino nu_H,
the top and bottom quarks, t and b.

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,340
There is a quantum number
which is called flavor which

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,550
distinguishes between
the generations inside each family.

64
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,346
It is conserved by all interactions
except the weak interactions.

65
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,980
The range of masses in this table is very,
very large.

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,580
Neutrinos are the lightest matter particles.

67
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,020
Their masses are found
experimentally to be below two electron

68
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,180
volts but they are probably rather in
the range of milli electron volts meV.

69
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,340
We will talk about them in Module 6,
which covers weak interactions.

70
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,040
The top quark has a mass
as large as a Hafnium nucleus.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,430
The Hafnium nucleus has
an atomic number 178 and

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,350
72 positive electric charges.

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,855
But as far as we know the top quark
is a point-like particle like

74
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,895
all the others in this table.

75
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,526
With these constituents we can
implement an order scheme,

76
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:28,821
a descriptive nomenclature,
à la Liné.

77
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:31,695
We call hadrons
all particles which contain quarks.

78
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,023
They are sensitive to strong and
nuclear reactions, leptons are not.

79
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:41,130
Baryons are bound states
formed by three quarks.

80
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,432
Mesons contain a quark and an anti-quark.

81
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:46,015
And the two together form
what we call hadrons.

82
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:49,570
The nucleons p and n are the lightest baryons.

83
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,070
They form the atomic
nuclei we find around us.

84
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,575
And particles like the pion are the
lightest mesons formed by quarks and

85
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:58,634
anti-quarks.

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,790
There are no hadrons including a top
quark because of it's short lifetime.

87
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,490
This quark decays before it can ever
form a bound state with any others.

88
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,610
Leptons on the right of this
table are elementary in the sense

89
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,090
that they are not composed of
other particles for all we know.

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,860
Observations are compatible with them
having no size, they are thus point-like and so

91
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,250
are the quarks.

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,350
But not the hadrons.

93
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,920
We will often see the neutrinos, nu_e,
nu_mu and nu_tau in tables of this sort.

94
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,280
I don't adhere to this.

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,640
These particles, nu_e, nu_mu and nu_tau
are mixtures of the true particles with

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,320
a specific mass which we denote by nu_L,
nu_M and nu_H in this course.

97
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,330
Ww thus respect their mass hierarchy and
assign them to their respective

98
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,370
generations according to that property
like we do for all other particles.

99
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,695
The enormous strength of
the strong force binds together,

100
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:04,350
quarks to form very stable bound states.

101
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,270
To be sensitive to the strong force,

102
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,555
particles need to have the necessary
charge, which is called color charge.

103
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:14,190
Quarks do have color charge,
leptons do not.

104
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,010
This leads to a whole zoology of
hadrons as shown in this summary table.

105
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,600
The Particle Data Group is responsible
to collect all the data concerning their

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,470
properties, an exhaustive list of states

107
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,070
as well as a summary of the known
properties is available on the site of

108
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,010
the Particle Data Group quoted in
red on the bottom of the slide.

109
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,720
On the left you see a list of
baryons containing three quarks.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,960
Like the proton which
is a uud bound state.

111
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,930
And the neutron which
is a dud bound state.

112
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,010
On the right is a list of meson formed
by quarks, quark anti-quark pairs,

113
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,080
like the positive pion
which is a u-dbar bound state.

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,191
Leptons are not sensitive to the strong
force because they do not carry

115
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,955
the necessary color charge. They 
intreact only,

116
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,767
via the electromagnetic and

117
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,827
weak forces and do not form long lasting
bound states among themselves.

118
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:19,750
Here's a table summarizing some important
properties of elementary particles.

119
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,940
In the upper half of the table you
find the constituents of matter.

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,590
Leptons and quarks are of
spin one half as you can see.

121
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,100
In the lower half you find
particles that transmit forces.

122
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,774
These are bosons of integer spin.

123
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,556
The charges are indicated in units of
an elementary charge for each one of them,

124
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:43,821
like the one of the electron in
the case of the electric charge.

125
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:48,621
Here we say that its charge
is -1 which means that it is 

126
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,260
-1 times the elementary charge, e.

127
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,780
The weak charge is called weak isospin and
it has two components

128
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,810
in contrast to the electromagnetic
charge which has only one component.

129
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,291
We denote them by T and T3,

130
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:12,740
the total length of the weak isospin and
its third component.

131
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,290
This charge depends on the orientation of
the spin of the particle with respect to

132
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,040
its direction of motion, which means
it depends on the helicity of the particle.

133
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,880
The strong charge has three components.

134
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,050
It's called color, and we use the
abbreviation r for red, g for green, and

135
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,280
b for blue to denote them.

136
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,780
Color is a property of quarks and

137
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,730
of gluons where the latter even carry
a color and an anti-color simultaneously.

138
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,650
For every particle, there's an
anti-particle which has the same mass but

139
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,839
all charges opposite,
as indicated in this red table.

140
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,440
Charges are additive quantum numbers.

141
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,390
For a system of particles
the total charge is the sum

142
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,640
of the charges of its constituents.

143
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
But there are other quantum
numbers that are conserved.

144
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,900
The first one quoted here is
the total number of baryons,

145
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,120
i.e. the number of baryons minus
the number of anti baryons in a system.

146
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,190
This number is conserved,

147
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,340
this applies in particular to quarks
which have a baryon number of 1/3,

148
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,710
and anti-quarks which have
a baryon number of minus 1/3.

149
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,215
The total lepton number, the number
of leptons minus the number of

150
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:38,490
antileptons is also constant
in a closed system.

151
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,200
To a certain extent this is even
true generation by generation but

152
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,830
the neutrinos which show up here,
nu_e, nu_mu and

153
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,960
nu_tau are mixtures of the true particles,
nu_L, nu_M and nu_H.

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,980
So, there's some mixture between
generations in weak interactions.

155
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,685
But more important than that,

156
00:10:57,685 --> 00:11:02,170
the charges of all types are rigorously
conserved as far we know.

157
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,110
This evidently concerns the electric
charge Q that you are familiar with but

158
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,390
also the weak isospin T and

159
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,740
T3, and the color charges R, G, and B.

160
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,770
The flavor which distinguishes
between generations is a special case.

161
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,140
It is conserved by the strong and
electromagnetic interactions but

162
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,579
can be altered by the weak one.

163
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,690
We will define what it exactly
means to conserve a quantum number
