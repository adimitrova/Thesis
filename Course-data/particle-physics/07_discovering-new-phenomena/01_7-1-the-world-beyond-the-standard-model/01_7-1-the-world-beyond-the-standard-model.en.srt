00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,706
[MUSIC],

2
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:14,430
In this seventh module, we'll discuss
searches for new phenomena beyond

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,390
the known ones described by the Standard
Model, and covered in previous modules.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,410
We're going to remind you
why we need new physics.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,320
We will explain how we render hadron
collider data usable for searches and

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,980
we will discuss examples,

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,770
split in two categories,
based on the general characteristics

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,300
of how new phenomena would
manifest themselves.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,880
In this video, we will describe the
theoretical limitations of the standard

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,310
model and talk about new theories that
have been proposed to overcome them.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,514
After watching this video,

12
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:52,387
you will know which are the open questions
the Standard Model leaves unanswered,

13
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:56,837
how the theories are attempting to
answer them using a particular theory as

14
00:00:56,837 --> 00:01:01,309
an example and where we stand in our
searches, using the hadron colliders.

15
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:07,510
The Standard Model is our starting point.

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,960
It describes the world as we know it
today introducing matter particles and

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,280
force carrier particles, the gauge bosons.

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,900
Matter and forces have been
introduced in module 1 and

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,020
detailed in modules 4 to 6.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,380
All these particles have been
observed experimentally,

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,000
the last one being the Higgs
boson a few years ago.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,820
This was explained in module 6.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,310
The precision with which the Standard
Model describes our world

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,360
is really astonishing.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,200
For example, here you can see
a representation of the cross sections with

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,270
which various processes occur at LHC, 
measured by the Atlas experiment for

27
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,795
various center of mass energies
of the colliding protons.

28
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:59,255
More importantly, note how this compares
to the Standard Model theoretical

29
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:03,975
prediction represented by the solid lines.

30
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:07,265
For a huge range of production rates,

31
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:12,055
the theory agrees surprisingly well with
the measurements on our collision data.

32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,590
Despite it's great success, the Standard
Model remains a piece in a bigger puzzle.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,092
It leaves, in fact,
many questions unanswered.

34
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:29,555
The Standard Model does not explain
why the Higgs boson is measured to be

35
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:31,080
so light.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,480
Quantum corrections to its
propagator like the ones shown here,

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,687
ought to push its mass
to much higher values.

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,369
The Standard Model does not explain
also the observation that the stars in

39
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:50,958
the outskirts of the galaxies rotate
much faster compared to theoretical

40
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:57,370
predictions, which indicates the existence
of a new form of matter, the dark matter.

41
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,792
The dark matter will be
explained in video 8.2.

42
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:07,175
Experiments show that the strong and
weak forces become weaker and

43
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:12,130
that the electromagnetic force becomes
stronger as the energy increases.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,720
We have introduced this
phenomenon in video 5.4.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,280
This is a good indication that
at incredibly high energies

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,960
the strength of
the electromagnetic, weak and

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,270
the strong forces is probably the same.

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,910
The Standard Model, however,

49
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,770
does not provide a unification of
these forces at very high energies.

50
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,040
What is really happening there?

51
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,647
A lot of thought has
been given to this and

52
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:44,898
other problems the Standard
Model comes with and

53
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:49,910
ways to mitigate them have been attempted
by theorists all over the world.

54
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,070
Theorists have come up with many
theories or models, in many variants,

55
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,920
trying to address one or more problems
of the Standard Model at a time.

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,150
In some of them, they introduce extra
space-time dimensions as a way to explain

57
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,750
why gravity is a much weaker force
than the other fundamental forces.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,930
In such theories, hypothetical force
carrier particles called gravitons

59
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,500
could be disappearing into extra
dimensions after having been created for

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,480
example at the proton-proton
collision of the LHC.

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,410
There are many other theories and
models that introduce new particles or

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,009
interactions.

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,070
Common in many of his theories is
the presence of new heavy bosons,

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,190
similar to the W and Z bosons,
denoted as W' and Z'.

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,910
How we search for
a Z' boson will be explained in video 7.3.

66
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,900
A large theoretical framework of
beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,970
has been developed in the last decades is
supersymmetry, also know as SUSY.

68
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,143
Supersymmetry is one of
the most discussed and

69
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:07,106
studied extensions of the Standard Model.

70
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:14,113
It imposes a symmetry between
the spins of forces and matter,

71
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,030
which does not exist
in the Standard Model.

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,780
The Standard Model only has
fermionic matter and bosonic forces.

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,840
The symmetry requires that there
be a supersymmetric partner

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,910
to all particles in our periodic system.

75
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,180
They are so-called superpartners.

76
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,680
However, we already know that
symmetry is a badly broken symmetry.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,387
The superpartners,
if they exist at all, must have very

78
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:47,699
different masses to the known
particles in our periodic table.

79
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:56,310
Supersymmetry is supposed to be solving all
of the Standard Model problems, at once.

80
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,880
Let's take the first open question we
talked about, the Higgs mass problem.

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,430
The calculation of the Higgs mass
within supersymmetry has

82
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,970
extra loop terms coming from
the extra particles it introduces.

83
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,890
These terms could cancel the large
terms in the calculation,

84
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,470
leading to a Higgs mass that is
compatible to the experimental result.

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,790
The lightest superpartner can be neutral,
stable, and

86
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,334
weakly interacting with matter, becoming
a perfect dark matter candidate.

87
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:32,500
And if supersymmetric particles were
included in the Standard Model,

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,230
the strengths of its three forces
could have the same exact strength

89
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,030
at high energies,
as in the early Universe.

90
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,680
Supersymmetric particles
have been searched for

91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,560
at lepton and hadron colliders for
many decades now, but they remain elusive.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,990
We show here limits for

93
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,020
the mass the gluino, the superpartner
of the gluon, obtained in a specific

94
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,559
supersymmetric model at the latest
three generations of hadron colliders.

95
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,901
The available parameter space for

96
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:11,840
supersymmetry becomes increasingly
constrained by the experimental findings.

97
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,920
The case is similar for
many new theories and models.

98
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,180
Despite the fact that
there are no hints for

99
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,970
new physics in the collider
experiments today,

100
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,810
the urge to find new
physics is always present.

101
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,630
And it is the reason why
high-energy physicists

102
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,620
keep on seeking an anomaly in the data.

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,680
This concludes the first
video of this seventh module.

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,437
In the next video, we will describe the
tools physicists are using to make sense

105
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:45,265
of the data collected at hadron colliders
in order to produce physics results and

106
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,908
search for new phenomena.

107
