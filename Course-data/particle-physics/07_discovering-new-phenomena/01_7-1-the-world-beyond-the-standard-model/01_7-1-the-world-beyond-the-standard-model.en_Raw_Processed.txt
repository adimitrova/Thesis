music, 
in this seventh module, well discuss 
searches new phenomena beyond 
known ones described standard 
model, covered in previous modules 
going to remind you 
we need new physics 
we will explain we render hadron 
collider data usable searches 
we will discuss examples, 
split in two categories, 
based general characteristics 
new phenomena would 
manifest 
in this video, we will describe 
theoretical limitations standard 
model talk new theories that 
proposed to overcome 
watching this video, 
you will know open questions 
standard model leaves unanswered, 
theories attempting to 
answer using a particular theory 
an example we stand in 
searches, using hadron colliders 
standard model is starting point 
describes world we know 
today introducing matter particles 
force carrier particles, gauge bosons 
matter forces 
introduced in module 
detailed in modules to 
particles 
observed experimentally, 
last one higgs 
boson a few years ago 
this explained in module 
precision standard 
model describes world 
is really astonishing 
example, here you see 
a representation cross sections 
various processes occur lhc, 
measured atlas experiment 
various center mass energies 
colliding protons 
importantly, note this compares 
to standard model theoretical 
prediction represented solid lines 
a huge range production rates, 
theory agrees surprisingly well 
measurements collision data 
despite great success, standard 
model remains a piece in a bigger puzzle 
leaves, in fact, 
many questions unanswered 
standard model explain 
higgs boson is measured to 
so light 
quantum corrections to 
propagator like ones shown here, 
ought to push mass 
to much higher values 
standard model explain 
also observation that stars in 
outskirts galaxies rotate 
much faster compared to theoretical 
predictions, indicates existence 
a new form matter, dark matter 
dark matter will 
explained in video 
experiments show that strong 
weak forces become weaker 
that electromagnetic force becomes 
stronger energy increases 
we introduced this 
phenomenon in video 
this is a good indication that 
incredibly high energies 
strength 
electromagnetic, weak 
strong forces is probably 
standard model, however, 
provide a unification 
forces high energies 
is really happening there 
a lot thought 
given to this 
problems standard 
model comes 
ways to mitigate attempted 
theorists world 
theorists come many 
theories models, in many variants, 
trying to address one problems 
standard model a time 
in them, introduce extra 
spacetime dimensions a way to explain 
gravity is a much weaker force 
fundamental forces 
in theories, hypothetical force 
carrier particles called gravitons 
could disappearing extra 
dimensions created 
example protonproton 
collision lhc 
there many theories 
models that introduce new particles 
interactions 
common in many theories is 
presence new heavy bosons, 
similar to w z bosons, 
denoted w z 
we search 
a z boson will explained in video 
a large theoretical framework 
beyondthestandardmodel physics that 
developed in last decades is 
supersymmetry, also know susy 
supersymmetry is one 
discussed 
studied extensions standard model 
imposes a symmetry between 
spins forces matter, 
exist 
in standard model 
standard model 
fermionic matter bosonic forces 
symmetry requires that there 
a supersymmetric partner 
to particles in periodic system 
socalled superpartners 
however, we already know that 
symmetry is a badly broken symmetry 
superpartners, 
if exist all, must 
different masses to known 
particles in periodic table 
supersymmetry is supposed to solving 
standard model problems, 
lets take first open question we 
talked about, higgs mass problem 
calculation higgs mass 
within supersymmetry 
extra loop terms coming 
extra particles introduces 
terms could cancel large 
terms in calculation, 
leading to a higgs mass that is 
compatible to experimental result 
lightest superpartner neutral, 
stable, 
weakly interacting matter, becoming 
a perfect dark matter candidate 
if supersymmetric particles 
included in standard model, 
strengths three forces 
could exact strength 
high energies, 
in early universe 
supersymmetric particles 
searched 
lepton hadron colliders 
many decades now, remain elusive 
we show here limits 
mass gluino, superpartner 
gluon, obtained in a specific 
supersymmetric model latest 
three generations hadron colliders 
available parameter space 
supersymmetry becomes increasingly 
constrained experimental findings 
case is similar 
many new theories models 
despite fact that 
there hints 
new physics in collider 
experiments today, 
urge to find new 
physics is always present 
is reason 
highenergy physicists 
keep seeking an anomaly in data 
this concludes first 
video this seventh module 
in next video, we will describe 
tools physicists using to make sense 
data collected hadron colliders 
in order to produce physics results 
search new phenomena
