[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:14,570
So thank you very much, Nico, for
being here with us for this interview.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,660
Could you tell us a couple
of words about yourself?

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,860
>> Okay.
Thanks, Anna.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,980
Thanks for inviting me.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,650
So, I'm Nico Serra.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,990
I'm professor at University of Zurich and
I work in the LHCb experiment.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,520
>> The LHCb experiment.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,370
Could you tell us how the detector
of the LHCb experiment differs with

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,890
respect to the bigger,
general purpose detectors at the LHC?

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,050
>> So, LHCb has been designed and
optimized in order to measure

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,280
properties of c and c hadrons,
Hadrons containing the b and c quarks.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,030
This explains the peculiar geometry,

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,280
which is similar to the geometry
of fixed target experiments

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,510
rather than onion-like geometry that you can
see at detectors like ATLAS and CMS.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,210
And the reason is that the partons
that compose the protons,

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,760
the quarks and gluons, have a much
higher probability to carry a low

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,830
momentum fraction of the proton with respect to
carrying a large fraction of its momentum.

19
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,789
Therefore, to produce
relatively light objects like for

20
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:29,600
instance b hadrons, the probability is much
higher to have asymmetric collisions.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,550
This implies that b hadrons are produced
predominantly in the beam direction,

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,450
forward and backward, and
with a very large Lorentz boost.

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,500
So this geometry, therefore,

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,940
allows to collect a really large
statistics of b hadrons even

25
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,120
if covering really small solid angles and
operating at a lower luminosity.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,419
In addition, it has the advantage,
since the b hadrons have a large

27
00:01:57,419 --> 00:02:03,550
Lorentz boost, decays are really displaced
with respect to the proton-proton interaction.

28
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,100
And these are very big
handles against background.

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,490
And in this geometry, we can easily
accommodate RICH detectors for

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,520
particle identification. Particle identificatiob,

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,470
momentum resolution and vertex
resolution are the key feature in order

32
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,790
to select the signal over the background.

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,400
>> Good, so, you said that the LHCb
detector operates at lower luminosities

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,800
with respect to other
experiments like ATLAS,

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,680
in whose cavern we are right now,
by the way.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,860
So that means that there
are smaller event rates.

37
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,960
Does it mean that we do not
need a trigger anymore?

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,240
>> No, we do need a trigger.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,010
And starting from the 40 MHz
bunch crossing rate,

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,290
we have a hardware level-0 trigger that
reduces the rate to about 1 MHz.

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,140
After that, we run a software high-level trigger

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,900
that runs a mixture of inclusive and
exclusive selections to further reduce the rate.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,138
And recently we had a major
shift in the paradigm of triggering in LHCb.

44
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:12,460
And this is done in preparation for
the LHCb upgrade,

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,870
where we will run directly a
fully software trigger.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,380
So what we do is to buffer events
in the disk, and to perform online

47
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,890
calibration and alignment of
the detector such that we will run in

48
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,960
the upgrade the same event reconstruction
as offline with the same quality.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,300
>> That's very interesting, indeed.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,440
Can we can now focus on the searches?

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,870
What type of searches do you at the LHCb?

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,010
>> So, at LHCb we do searches for
new physics.

53
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,930
But rather than doing direct search
of bumps and tails of new particles,

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,719
we hunt for
these particles as virtual particles.

55
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,232
So, let me explain this with an example.

56
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:59,720
For instance, let's consider
the decay of the B_s mesons in a di-muon pair.

57
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,920
This decay is a very rare decay in
the standard model because it is

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,470
suppressed by the GIM mechanism and
also helicity suppressed.

59
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,400
And its branching ratio is about
3 10^-9.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,180
If you have new particles,
like, for instance,

61
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,410
in supersymmetry,
they can enter in mediating this decay.

62
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,770
And they can change
the properties of this decay.

63
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,810
For instance, they can enhance this
branching ratio by orders of magnitude.

64
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,449
Therefore, you compare what you
measure with the predictions.

65
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,060
>> If you actually measure
then this type of decay,

66
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,460
you can constraint
supersymmetry as well.

67
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,026
>> Exactly.

68
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:42,440
For instance of all this particular
decays, the fact that we measure a value

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,998
of the branching ratio that is in agreement
with standard model predictions allows to

70
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,010
strongly contains supersymmetry.

71
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,140
Also consider that this is complimentary

72
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,390
with respect to direct
searches in ATLAS and CMS.

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,780
Because since we hunt these particles
as virtual particles,

74
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,970
we are not limited by the available
energy in the center of mass.

75
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,670
So we can in principle
constrain particle that have mass

76
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,210
higher than
the collision energy at the LHC.

77
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,630
>> I see.

78
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,680
Could you explain to us
how such a search is done?

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,350
>> So these are rare decays so

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,390
it's very important the selection.

81
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,170
You have to be efficient in rejecting
the background and selecting the signal.

82
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,930
Then, we attribute the di-muon pair to the B_s,

83
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:38,670
because essentially, we see a mass
bump in the di-muon invariant mass spectrum.

84
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,910
But the difference is that we
do know what is the mass of the B_s,

85
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,820
so we do not have the so called « look elsewhere » effect.

86
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,720
But you do need to know

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,540
very well the efficiency of your
detector and the background.

88
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,800
And you have to know how many B_s
are produced originally.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,920
What you do normally is to normalize with
respect to another decay that you

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,100
know very well with a very
well known branching ratio.

91
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,000
And you choose this decay,
such that you can somehow

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,670
cancel some systematic
uncertainties in the ratio.

93
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,470
>> Okay, now you talk about uncertainties.

94
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,790
How do these compromise
this type of measurements?

95
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,110
>> So, first of all we have three
types of uncertainties in these searches.

96
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,688
The statistical uncertainties like
everywhere due to the limited statistics.

97
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:33,460
Then you have the systematic
uncertainties.

98
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,233
In this case for instance, a 
source of systematic would be the limited

99
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:42,910
knowledge of the efficiency or the limited
knowledge of the background.

100
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,740
And in addition, since we compare our
measurement with the predictions,

101
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,560
we have uncertainties which are due to
the accuracy of the theory predictions.

102
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,160
This is due to the fact that theories
have to extrapolate from the Feynman

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,940
diagrams at the quark level, to 
what happens at the hadron level.

104
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,910
And this involves uncertainty
due to QCD essentially.

105
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,410
>> Okay.

106
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:11,400
So, do you see any deviations with
respect to the standard model in

107
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,230
this channel or elsewhere?

108
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,600
>> So we don't see deviations in
B_s -> µ+ µ- but

109
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,360
we do see deviations with respect
to the standard model elsewhere.

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,720
>> Could you tell us more about that,
actually?

111
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,720
>> Yes, so
one of the things we test at LHCb is

112
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,706
the lepton flavor universality in b decays.

113
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:37,335
So, as the students know, the electron,
the muon and

114
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:42,155
the tau, they behave exactly
the same way apart from their mass,

115
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:46,755
which comes from their different
interactions with the HIggs boson.

116
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:50,595
But apart of that they behave
exactly in the same way.

117
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:55,463
So if you have a branching ratio of a B meson
decaying to charged leptons and

118
00:07:55,463 --> 00:08:02,210
you factor out the effect of
the mass in the phase space,

119
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,450
their branching ratios should be the same.

120
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,310
If you have a new particles,
new virtual particles as I said before,

121
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,500
they might couple differently
to electron, muon and tau and

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,170
they would spoil the lepton
universality of the standard model.

123
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,540
So, what we see is exactly a departure
from this lepton universality,

124
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,050
in some B decays and by now,

125
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,330
we need more data to be
certain of this deviation but

126
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,630
it certainly looks like

127
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,830
an intriguing pattern we are seeing.

128
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,830
>> Okay, well it is certainly interesting
the breadth of the research program of LHCb.

129
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,310
What else have you discovered?

130
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,440
Could you tell us a bit more about that?

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,130
>> Yes, so in addition to search for
new physics,

132
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,520
what we do is also to do
spectroscopy, to measure properties of

133
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,460
particles, of hadrons predicted by
the quark model. For instance,

134
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,010
by doing bump searches,
as you do in ATLAS, but at lower masses.

135
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,030
We discover new excited states
of D mesons and B mesons.

136
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,355
And in addition, we also do different
analysis which are called amplitude

137
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:19,690
analysis that allows us to measure
the quantum numbers of these particles.

138
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:27,707
For instance, the resonance X(3872) that was
long thought to be a D meson molecule.

139
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:32,382
We could discard this
hyphothesis exactly by measuring

140
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,706
the quantum numbers of this resonance.

141
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:41,630
And also relatively recently,
we discovered two particles,

142
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:48,570
which are consistent with being neither
baryons not mesons but pentaquarks.

143
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,330
So particles composed by four quarks and
one anti-quark.

144
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,590
And this was a breaking ground results.

145
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,580
>> That sounds really exciting indeed.

146
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,750
But now how about the prospects of LHCb for
the future?

147
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,960
>> So, most of our measurements
first of all are dominated

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,730
by the statistical errors.

149
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,440
So it means that, in order

150
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,070
to exploit fully the LHC potential,
we need more statistics.

151
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,800
And therefore we are working
to prepare an upgrade of the LHCb

152
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,600
detector to run at higher luminosity.

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,520
In addition as I said,
in most measurements

154
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,440
we do see a striking agreement
with respect to standard model and

155
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,110
prediction, but
we also see some deviation.

156
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,670
So our hope is that in the future
we will reveal a pattern of

157
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,570
this deviation that can lead us
to the discovery of new physics.

158
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,400
>> The prospects for LHCb to be are really
exciting from what you are telling us.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,430
So, we really hope that you reveal
this interesting patterns indeed.

160
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,106
Thank you very much

161
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:58,415
for this interview, Nico.

162
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:01,730
>> Thank you Anna, bye.
