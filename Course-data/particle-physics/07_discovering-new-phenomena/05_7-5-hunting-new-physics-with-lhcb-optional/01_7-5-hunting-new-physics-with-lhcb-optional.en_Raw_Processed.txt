music 
so thank you much, nico, 
here us this interview 
could you tell us a couple 
words 
okay 
thanks, anna 
thanks inviting 
so, im nico serra 
im professor university zurich 
i work in lhcb experiment 
lhcb experiment 
could you tell us detector 
lhcb experiment differs 
respect to bigger, 
general purpose detectors lhc 
so, lhcb designed 
optimized in order to measure 
properties c c hadrons, 
hadrons containing b c quarks 
this explains peculiar geometry, 
is similar to geometry 
fixed target experiments 
rather onionlike geometry that you 
see detectors like atlas cms 
reason is that partons 
that compose protons, 
quarks gluons, a much 
higher probability to carry a low 
momentum fraction proton respect to 
carrying a large fraction momentum 
therefore, to produce 
relatively light objects like 
instance b hadrons, probability is much 
higher to asymmetric collisions 
this implies that b hadrons produced 
predominantly in beam direction, 
forward backward, 
a large lorentz boost 
so this geometry, therefore, 
allows to collect a really large 
statistics b hadrons even 
if covering really small solid angles 
operating a lower luminosity 
in addition, advantage, 
since b hadrons a large 
lorentz boost, decays really displaced 
respect to protonproton interaction 
big 
handles background 
in this geometry, we easily 
accommodate rich detectors 
particle identification particle identificatiob, 
momentum resolution vertex 
resolution key feature in order 
to select signal background 
good, so, you said that lhcb 
detector operates lower luminosities 
respect to 
experiments like atlas, 
in whose cavern we right now, 
way 
so that means that there 
smaller event rates 
mean that we 
need a trigger anymore 
no, we need a trigger 
starting mhz 
bunch crossing rate, 
we a hardware level trigger that 
reduces rate to mhz 
that, we run a software highlevel trigger 
that runs a mixture inclusive 
exclusive selections to reduce rate 
recently we a major 
shift in paradigm triggering in lhcb 
this is done in preparation 
lhcb upgrade, 
we will run directly a 
fully software trigger 
so we is to buffer events 
in disk, to perform online 
calibration alignment 
detector that we will run in 
upgrade event reconstruction 
offline quality 
thats interesting, indeed 
we focus searches 
type searches you lhcb 
so, lhcb we searches 
new physics 
rather direct search 
bumps tails new particles, 
we hunt 
particles virtual particles 
so, let explain this an example 
instance, lets consider 
decay bs mesons in a dimuon pair 
this decay is a rare decay in 
standard model is 
suppressed gim mechanism 
also helicity suppressed 
branching ratio is 
if you new particles, 
like, instance, 
in supersymmetry, 
enter in mediating this decay 
change 
properties this decay 
instance, enhance this 
branching ratio orders magnitude 
therefore, you compare you 
measure predictions 
if you actually measure 
this type decay, 
you constraint 
supersymmetry well 
exactly 
instance this particular 
decays, fact that we measure a value 
branching ratio that is in agreement 
standard model predictions allows to 
strongly contains supersymmetry 
also consider that this is complimentary 
respect to direct 
searches in atlas cms 
since we hunt particles 
virtual particles, 
we limited available 
energy in center mass 
so we in principle 
constrain particle that mass 
higher 
collision energy lhc 
i see 
could you explain to us 
a search is done 
so rare decays so 
important selection 
you to efficient in rejecting 
background selecting signal 
then, we attribute dimuon pair to bs, 
essentially, we see a mass 
bump in dimuon invariant mass spectrum 
difference is that we 
know is mass bs, 
so we so called look elsewhere effect 
you need to know 
well efficiency 
detector background 
you to know many bs 
produced originally 
you normally is to normalize 
respect to another decay that you 
know well a 
well known branching ratio 
you choose this decay, 
that you somehow 
cancel systematic 
uncertainties in ratio 
okay, you talk uncertainties 
compromise 
this type measurements 
so, first we three 
types uncertainties in searches 
statistical uncertainties like 
everywhere due to limited statistics 
you systematic 
uncertainties 
in this case instance, a 
source systematic would limited 
knowledge efficiency limited 
knowledge background 
in addition, since we compare 
measurement predictions, 
we uncertainties due to 
accuracy theory predictions 
this is due to fact that theories 
to extrapolate feynman 
diagrams quark level, to 
happens hadron level 
this involves uncertainty 
due to qcd essentially 
okay 
so, you see deviations 
respect to standard model in 
this channel elsewhere 
so we dont see deviations in 
bs 
we see deviations respect 
to standard model elsewhere 
could you tell us that, 
actually 
yes, so 
one things we test lhcb is 
lepton flavor universality in b decays 
so, students know, electron, 
muon 
tau, behave exactly 
way apart mass, 
comes different 
interactions higgs boson 
apart that behave 
exactly in way 
so if you a branching ratio a b meson 
decaying to charged leptons 
you factor effect 
mass in phase space, 
branching ratios 
if you a new particles, 
new virtual particles i said before, 
might couple differently 
to electron, muon tau 
would spoil lepton 
universality standard model 
so, we see is exactly a departure 
this lepton universality, 
in b decays now, 
we need data to 
certain this deviation 
certainly looks like 
an intriguing pattern we seeing 
okay, well is certainly interesting 
breadth research program lhcb 
else you discovered 
could you tell us a bit that 
yes, so in addition to search 
new physics, 
we is also to 
spectroscopy, to measure properties 
particles, hadrons predicted 
quark model instance, 
bump searches, 
you in atlas, lower masses 
we discover new excited states 
d mesons b mesons 
in addition, we also different 
analysis called amplitude 
analysis that allows us to measure 
quantum numbers particles 
instance, resonance x that 
long thought to a d meson molecule 
we could discard this 
hyphothesis exactly measuring 
quantum numbers this resonance 
also relatively recently, 
we discovered two particles, 
consistent neither 
baryons mesons pentaquarks 
so particles composed four quarks 
one antiquark 
this a breaking ground results 
that sounds really exciting indeed 
prospects lhcb 
future 
so, measurements 
first dominated 
statistical errors 
so means that, in order 
to exploit fully lhc potential, 
we need statistics 
therefore we working 
to prepare an upgrade lhcb 
detector to run higher luminosity 
in addition i said, 
in measurements 
we see a striking agreement 
respect to standard model 
prediction, 
we also see deviation 
so hope is that in future 
we will reveal a pattern 
this deviation that lead us 
to discovery new physics 
prospects lhcb to really 
exciting you telling us 
so, we really hope that you reveal 
this interesting patterns indeed 
thank you much 
this interview, nico 
thank you anna, bye
