2
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:13,330
In this module, we discuss searches for

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,451
new phenomena beyond the known ones
described by the standard model.

4
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:19,245
In this video,
we will discuss searches for

5
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,349
tails in characteristic
event distributions.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,860
This type of searches are, for

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,045
example, typically used in searches for
supersymmetry.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,490
After watching this video,

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,451
you will know, how we typically search for
supersymmetry in hadron colliders.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,970
What is the main challenge

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,160
of researches in the BC
proton-proton collision environment.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,160
And, where we stand in our search for
supersymmetry and

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,290
new physics in general using
the ATLAS experiment as an example.

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,459
We are typically searching for new physics
looking for bumps on a steeply falling

15
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:01,360
spectrum or looking for enhanced tails in
the distribution of a relevant quantity.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,850
We already talked in the previous
video about bump searches

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,190
using the heavy Z boson as an example.

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,479
While this type of searches
is very intuitive and

19
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,219
convincing in case of a positive result,

20
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,324
such bumps are not easy to identify in
the case of supersymmetric particles.

21
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,519
Supersymmetric particles decay in
cascades, generating long decay

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,930
chains which make it difficult to
identify a resonant signature.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,642
Given the large multiplicity and
variety of particles in the final state,

24
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:40,621
we are typically looking for an
enhancement in the tail of a distribution.

25
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:46,302
Relevant distributions can be related
to the multiplicity of a specific

26
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:50,937
type of object, for example jets, or
to missing transport momentum which in

27
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:56,251
many variants of supersymmetry is
enhanced by the emission of neutralinos.

28
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:00,356
These are the lightest supersymmetric
particles, neutral and

29
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:04,850
weakly interacting, escaping
the detector just like neutrinos do.

30
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:10,798
In a SUSY search, we are therefore looking for

31
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:16,630
signals that way where a relevant quantity
can be the missing transverse momentum.

32
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,110
The standard model backgrounds,
given the large number and

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,350
variety of objects involved in these
searches, are very complicated to estimate.

34
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,549
For background determination,

35
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:35,340
we are using data-driven methods combined
with simulation-based techniques.

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,760
We use standard model processes with
similar characteristics to verify that

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,000
the detector response to an assumed
signal properly simulated is,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
indeed, as expected.

39
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,140
In this type of searches,

40
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,210
the user of multivaried discriminance
is not uncommon in attempts to

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,770
achieve a more powerful discrimination of
the signal with respect to the background.

42
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:06,704
To increase sensitivity in models that
involve large multiplicity of

43
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:10,400
b quarks in the final state like
the one shown on this page,

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,730
we reconstruct jets
originating from a b quark.

45
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,740
We use the knowledge that
hadrons containing b quarks

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,440
travel a short distance inside
the detector before decaying.

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,762
Stable hadrons, on the contrary, come
directly from the proton-proton vertex.

48
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:35,923
We also reconstruct top quarks from their
decays using their kinematic properties.

49
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:40,499
The top quark decays to a b quark and
a W boson before

50
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:45,470
forming a hadron and
with a branching ratio close to 100%.

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,790
The W boson decays most often to a quark pair.

52
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,970
When the top quark has a large momentum,

53
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,780
its decay products are more collimated,
as shown in this picture.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,500
At high top quark momenta, some of the jets cannot
be disentangled from each other.

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,097
It is therefore common to define
wider jets, called fat jets,

56
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:14,730
which capture the products of the decay
of a high momentum top quark.

57
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,673
We can therefore require, for example,

58
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:22,145
the presence of multiple fat
jets in collision events,

59
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:26,335
a requirement that can improve
the signal to background discrimination

60
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:29,845
compared to an event selection that
does not include such requirements.

61
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:37,835
You can see in these figures examples
of how final distributions look like.

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,110
The filled areas show the standard
model prediction while the dashed line

63
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,327
shows how supersymmetry
would manifest itself.

64
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:50,390
The black points show
the observed distributions

65
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,700
which agree very well with
the standard model prediction.

66
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,160
What is shown here where in fact,
two signal regions with the largest excess

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,030
on the left and largest deficit on
the right of a specific search.

68
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,930
The agreement with the standard model
predictions is usually even better

69
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,962
than what is demonstrated in
these examples. Getting tails of

70
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:19,745
a distribution right in hadron collider
data is a very significant challenge.

71
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:24,050
Many experimental factors can
alter the expected distributions,

72
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,036
therefore, careful study goes to
distributions with similar properties but

73
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,465
coming from well-known processes.

74
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:36,173
This ensures an excellent
understanding of those factors and

75
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,790
the associated systematic uncertainties.

76
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:46,015
One of the most significant challenges
comes from what we call pile-up.

77
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:50,300
At the LHC,
protons don't collide individually but

78
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,511
in bunches of hundreds
of billions of protons.

79
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:57,270
This results in multiple
collisions in a bunch crossing

80
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,950
leading to several low q^2 reactions.

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,430
Distinguishing the hard scattering process
from the rest and understanding

82
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,310
how pile-up affects the distribution of
interest are both very difficult tasks.

83
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,813
In the hadron colliders, we have achieved
a significant level of understanding,

84
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:20,679
having thoroughly studied
the LHC data collected so far.

85
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:24,860
Having looked at a very broad spectrum
of signatures, we have not yet

86
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,970
found any significant excesses
that could hint to new physics.

87
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,818
In lack of excesses,
we put limits to the theories and

88
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:39,110
models that have motivated our searches.

89
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,611
That way, we can obtain a global view
of where we stand with our searches and

90
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:51,449
ask theorists about their advice on which
direction to take in our future searches.

91
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:56,546
The figures in this slide
give the current picture for

92
00:06:56,546 --> 00:07:01,290
all ATLAS searches for
supersymmetry and other new phenomenon.

93
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,490
They are all expressed as lower
limits on the mass scale that

94
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,492
characterizes the process.

95
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,305
You can see we are close to
excluding supersymmetric particles up

96
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,464
to 2 TeV in mass.

97
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:24,186
Despite the fact that supersymmetry and
other theories beyond the Standard Model

98
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:28,852
remain elusive so far, the open
questions of the Standard Model are so

99
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:32,649
pressing that it is certain
there is something beyond.

100
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,900
With the increasing amount of
LHC data that is available,

101
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,820
we are on the right track
to find what that is.

102
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,030
We are faced with a unique chance to
make a unique discovery at the LHC.

103
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,802
And history has taught us,
it may be unexpected.

104
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:55,875
At the LHC experiments,
we are looking forward to that.
