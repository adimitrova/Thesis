in this module, we discuss searches 
new phenomena beyond known ones 
described standard model 
in this video, 
we will discuss searches 
tails in characteristic 
event distributions 
this type searches are, 
example, typically used in searches 
supersymmetry 
watching this video, 
you will know, we typically search 
supersymmetry in hadron colliders 
is main challenge 
researches in bc 
protonproton collision environment 
and, we stand in search 
supersymmetry 
new physics in general using 
atlas experiment an example 
we typically searching new physics 
looking bumps a steeply falling 
spectrum looking enhanced tails in 
distribution a relevant quantity 
we already talked in previous 
video bump searches 
using heavy z boson an example 
while this type searches 
is intuitive 
convincing in case a positive result, 
bumps easy to identify in 
case supersymmetric particles 
supersymmetric particles decay in 
cascades, generating long decay 
chains make difficult to 
identify a resonant signature 
given large multiplicity 
variety particles in final state, 
we typically looking an 
enhancement in tail a distribution 
relevant distributions related 
to multiplicity a specific 
type object, example jets, 
to missing transport momentum in 
many variants supersymmetry is 
enhanced emission neutralinos 
lightest supersymmetric 
particles, neutral 
weakly interacting, escaping 
detector like neutrinos 
in a susy search, we therefore looking 
signals that way a relevant quantity 
missing transverse momentum 
standard model backgrounds, 
given large number 
variety objects involved in 
searches, complicated to estimate 
background determination, 
we using datadriven methods combined 
simulationbased techniques 
we use standard model processes 
similar characteristics to verify that 
detector response to an assumed 
signal properly simulated is, 
indeed, expected 
in this type searches, 
user multivaried discriminance 
is uncommon in attempts to 
achieve a powerful discrimination 
signal respect to background 
to increase sensitivity in models that 
involve large multiplicity 
b quarks in final state like 
one shown this page, 
we reconstruct jets 
originating a b quark 
we use knowledge that 
hadrons containing b quarks 
travel a short distance inside 
detector decaying 
stable hadrons, contrary, come 
directly protonproton vertex 
we also reconstruct top quarks 
decays using kinematic properties 
top quark decays to a b quark 
a w boson 
forming a hadron 
a branching ratio close to 
w boson decays often to a quark pair 
top quark a large momentum, 
decay products collimated, 
shown in this picture 
high top quark momenta, jets cannot 
disentangled 
is therefore common to define 
wider jets, called fat jets, 
capture products decay 
a high momentum top quark 
we therefore require, example, 
presence multiple fat 
jets in collision events, 
a requirement that improve 
signal to background discrimination 
compared to an event selection that 
include requirements 
you see in figures examples 
final distributions look like 
filled areas show standard 
model prediction while dashed line 
shows supersymmetry 
would manifest 
black points show 
observed distributions 
agree well 
standard model prediction 
is shown here in fact, 
two signal regions largest excess 
left largest deficit 
right a specific search 
agreement standard model 
predictions is usually even better 
is demonstrated in 
examples getting tails 
a distribution right in hadron collider 
data is a significant challenge 
many experimental factors 
alter expected distributions, 
therefore, careful study goes to 
distributions similar properties 
coming wellknown processes 
this ensures an excellent 
understanding factors 
associated systematic uncertainties 
one significant challenges 
comes we call pileup 
lhc, 
protons dont collide individually 
in bunches hundreds 
billions protons 
this results in multiple 
collisions in a bunch crossing 
leading to several low q reactions 
distinguishing hard scattering process 
rest understanding 
pileup affects distribution 
interest difficult tasks 
in hadron colliders, we achieved 
a significant level understanding, 
thoroughly studied 
lhc data collected so far 
looked a broad spectrum 
signatures, we yet 
found significant excesses 
that could hint to new physics 
in lack excesses, 
we put limits to theories 
models that motivated searches 
that way, we obtain a global view 
we stand searches 
ask theorists advice 
direction to take in future searches 
figures in this slide 
give current picture 
atlas searches 
supersymmetry new phenomenon 
expressed lower 
limits mass scale that 
characterizes process 
you see we close to 
excluding supersymmetric particles 
to tev in mass 
despite fact that supersymmetry 
theories beyond standard model 
remain elusive so far, open 
questions standard model so 
pressing that is certain 
there is something beyond 
increasing amount 
lhc data that is available, 
we right track 
to find that is 
we faced a unique chance to 
make a unique discovery lhc 
history taught us, 
may unexpected 
lhc experiments, 
we looking forward to that
