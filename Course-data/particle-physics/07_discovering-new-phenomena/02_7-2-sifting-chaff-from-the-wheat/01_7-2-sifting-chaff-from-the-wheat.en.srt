[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:12,290
In this module, we discuss searches for

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,070
new phenomena beyond the known ones
described by the Standard Model.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,900
In this video, we will talk about
the life cycle of a collision event.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,740
From the time the event is produced
in the heart of a detector,

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,630
until it gets ready to be
processed in a physics analysis.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,920
After watching this video,

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,820
you will know why we trigger on physics
events in the collider experiments.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,562
How we translate the analog and

10
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:40,717
digital signals of the detectors
to physical objects

11
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:43,621
that we associate with
Standard Model particles for

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,370
the events we have triggered on.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,348
And how we deal with the large amounts of
data that are produced in the collider

14
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,353
experiments.

15
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:57,550
All that in connection to what we
need to search for new physics.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,760
As you already learned in module 3,

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,310
proton bunches each containing hundreds
of billions of protons collide at the LHC

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,809
in collision points where
experiments are installed.

19
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:19,618
This is one of the general purpose
detectors of the LHC, the ATLAS detector.

20
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,989
We have already gone through its elements
and their functions in video 3.10a.

21
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:33,285
If you take a look at the transverse
view of the detector you will see

22
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,550
that it has an onion structure.

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,632
It is made up of various layers
of different detectors.

24
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:45,194
An inner detector inside a solenoid
used for tracking charged particles.

25
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:49,857
Calorimeters for electromagnetic and
hadronic shower measurements.

26
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:53,380
And a muon spectrometer in
toroidal magnetic field, for

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,220
muon momentum measurements.

28
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:01,495
Proton-proton collisions result
in many particles which decay to

29
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:06,519
the lightest elementary particles
compatible with their quantum numbers.

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,287
These leave their signatures in the
detector as digital and analogue signals,

31
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:17,110
which reconstruct as objects that we
associate with elementary particles.

32
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,920
So the particles we reconstruct in the
detector are electrons, and photons, and

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,790
muons and quarks, and
gluons as particle jets.

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,690
Details about the detector
response to various particle types

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,270
are given in video 3.10a.

36
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,394
Events that contain sufficiently
interesting features to be further

37
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:44,060
analyzed are triggered on and
stored for further processing.

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,400
These events go through
event reconstruction.

39
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,790
To ensure an accurate measurement of the
properties of the reconstructed objects,

40
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,520
a calibration procedure is applied.

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,160
Calibrated objects are now ready for
analysis.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,420
In our analysis,

43
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,780
we need to compare our
data to theoretical calculations.

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,351
To achieve this, event simulations called
Monte Carlo simulations are performed,

45
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:15,580
which create artificial events based
on a specific theoretical assumption.

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,836
With these components in place,
reconstructed and

47
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,995
calibrated data on one hand,

48
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:26,455
and data simulated according to
theoretical predictions on the other hand,

49
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,105
we are ready to search for
new physics in our data.

50
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,710
But let's first understand
these components better.

51
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,700
And let's start from the trigger.

52
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,170
What does this actually do?

53
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:45,730
The LHC is colliding proton bunches
with a maximum rate of 40 MHz.

54
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,099
Each event recorded by the
experiment, containing all digital and

55
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,540
analog information from the detector,

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,720
has a data size of about one megabyte.

57
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,040
So saving all events would lead to
about 40 terabytes of data per second.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,480
This is a huge amount of data to store,
but also to process.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,680
Furthermore, most of these events
only contain known physics, so

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,770
we need to select which of them to keep.

61
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,790
This is where the trigger system comes in.

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,370
The trigger system of the large
multi-purpose experiments

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,760
consists of two main components,

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,390
a hardware based one and
a software based one.

65
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,770
The trigger system is built
to be extremely robust and

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,040
fast as it needs to take a reliable
decision in a very short time.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,545
The trigger helps the selection
of interesting events,

68
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:45,390
but also applies upper limits in
the number of events we select after

69
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,760
each of its steps.

70
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,650
Triggering on events that contain new
phenomena is an extremely big challenge.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,810
We don't know a priori how
these events would look like.

72
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,444
We therefore have to build our trigger
selections generic enough to ensure we

73
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,665
don't lose anything interesting,

74
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:08,250
as events we don't trigger on
are are simply lost forever.

75
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:16,294
For events that were triggered
the detector tells us about the elementary

76
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:19,779
particles that were created
in the collision process

77
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,670
as well as their properties.

78
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,400
Typically most of these particles are
relevant in the searches for new physics.

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,240
And we will see why in the following
videos of this module.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,060
An overview is given in video 3.10a.

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,930
Here, we summarize the detector response
to the main types of particles.

82
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:45,755
Electrons and muons both leave
tracks in the inner detector.

83
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:49,158
The electrons are reconstructed
by matching the track with

84
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,933
the electromagnetic shower.

85
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,050
For the muon,

86
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,118
the inner detector track is matched to
a muon track in the muon spectrometer.

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,432
Photons, being neutral,
leave no track in the inner detector.

88
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:08,132
And are therefore associated to
an electromagnetic shower with no track

89
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:09,139
pointing to it.

90
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,750
Quarks and gluons are much more
complicated objects to reconstruct.

91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,790
They can't live by themselves.

92
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,469
They have to exist in bound states,
as was already explained in module 5.

93
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,789
They hadronize and

94
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,969
are therefore reconstructed in
the calorimeter as a hadronic shower.

95
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,770
Algorithms scan the calorimeter
data in order to identify the most

96
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,120
significant energy depositions,
corresponding to quarks or gluons.

97
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,280
The resulting objects are the jets.

98
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,863
It's worth pointing out that
the dominant process resulting from

99
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:54,576
a proton-proton interaction is
the production of quarks and gluons.

100
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:57,770
Therefore jets dominate
the detected final states.

101
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,409
Neutrinos do not interact with a detector
and therefore escape undetected.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,240
However, we can get
information about neutrinos

103
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,450
using the knowledge that
in the transverse plane,

104
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,655
because of conservation of momentum,

105
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:18,602
the vector sum of the momenta of
all the objects has to be zero.

106
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:22,830
So neutrinos are associated with a
missing momentum in the transverse plane

107
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,231
Any neutral and
weakly interacting particle,

108
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:35,482
such as dark matter candidates,
will in fact behave just like neutrinos.

109
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:39,800
And will be identified as missing
transverse momentum in the detector.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,460
Missing transverse momentum is extremely
important in our searches for new physics.

111
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,885
W, Z, Higgs bosons, top quarks, and

112
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:54,565
tau leptons decay immediately
to elementary matter particles.

113
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:58,591
And we reconstruct them
through their decay products.

114
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:07,200
In a detector, we can therefore
observe various event topologies.

115
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,290
And based on their characteristics
we can classify the events.

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,950
This is in fact what we are doing
already at trigger level.

117
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,580
We are running algorithms that
perform simplified reconstruction.

118
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,396
And based on the characteristics of
the events, we accept or discard them.

119
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:29,345
For example, events with high momentum
objects, or large multiplicity of objects.

120
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:32,864
are accepted by the trigger for
further processing.

121
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:38,090
Events with only low energy particles
are not generally accepted,

122
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,823
as these are of no general interest
since they correspond to

123
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,630
low q^2 processes.

124
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,161
It would also be impossible to store and

125
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:52,445
process those as they
are the most common ones.

126
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:56,904
Despite the fact that we are finding ways
to reduce the amount of data we need to

127
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,532
process,

128
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:01,170
we are still generating
incredibly large amounts of data.

129
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,630
Such large amounts are needed to ensure
that the rarest processes will be produced

130
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,080
and saved in our data.

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,670
Such would be processes
coming from new physics.

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,170
This data gets reconstructed and
calibrated as we said.

133
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,570
It is the products of this
process we are eventually using

134
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,470
without ever discarding the original data,

135
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,255
since we often need to reprocess them to,
for example,

136
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,163
improve reconstruction or calibration.

137
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:35,586
In order to make the best use
of the large amount of data,

138
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,801
we use sophisticated methodologies,

139
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:40,574
such as machine learning techniques or

140
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:46,300
other statistical methods
which are often CPU intensive.

141
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,040
This adds to the computing
needs of the LHC experiments.

142
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,760
It is not only data and simulation storage
we need, but also processing power.

143
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,740
This is a combination that
creates a great challenge.

144
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,070
This challenge is being addressed
using major innovations in computing,

145
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,190
such as the computing grid.

146
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,473
Numerous computing centers in universities
all over the world are interconnected,

147
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,170
forming a computing grid.

148
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,565
They receive copies of the data.

149
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:21,988
And give the capability to
scientists to run their analyses

150
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:27,430
processes on this grid in an automatic and
transparent way.

151
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,210
Research and development in the computing
domain is in active progress.

152
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,126
And the task is always
extremely challenging and

153
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,840
rewarding at the same time.

154
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,720
This concludes this lecture.

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,699
In the next video we will talk
about a specific type of searches.

156
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,444
The so called bump searches.

157
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:51,879
