in this module, 
we will discuss searches 
new phenomenon beyond known ones 
described standard model 
in this video, we will talk bump hunting 
watching this video, you will 
know we look new resonances 
in hadron collider data 
signal choice led in 
past to important discoveries 
impact statistics searches 
we use data we collect in hadron 
colliders measurements processes 
predicted standard model 
searches new physics 
we typically measure crosssection 
a process, mass a particle, 
properties 
searches typically split 
in bump searches tail searches 
measurements always precede searches 
is confidence that we 
know well standard model 
predicts that 
enables us to look beyond 
one things we measure in data 
is rate production a specific 
process allows us to 
determine cross section 
is given formula you 
already seen in previous videos 
cross section process, 
example production a z boson, times 
branching ratio a specific decay, 
example to a dimuon pair, is equal 
to number events corresponding 
to exact process divided 
three numbers that remove biases related 
to way measurement is performed 
acceptance, indicating fraction 
signal events passing selection 
requirements applying to data 
reconstruction efficiency 
relevant objects, muons in example, 
integrated luminosity indicating 
amount incoming particles we used 
in numerator we to subtract 
total number events 
expected number background events 
events producing 
signature, a dimuon pair in example, 
resulting processes, 
different to process interest 
z boson discovered in 
protonantiproton collisions cern in 
a small bump around mass 
value shown in left plot 
constituted a major discovery back 
time, is a well established 
process now, we make precise 
measurements measure properties, 
crosssection 
plot right 
shows a mass peak 
z bosons decaying to two muons looks 
like in early atlas data back in 
despite small amount 
data available that time, 
is remarkable this compares to 
topology z discovered 
this established lepton pair signature 
one many particles 
discovered time 
is one key signatures we use in 
hadron colliders to search new peaks 
primarily, in high mass region 
this is muon pair mass 
spectrum looks like in atlas 
starting 
z mass peak 
extending to highest 
values we data 
blue area indicates 
contribution to this distribution 
a z boson decaying to two muons 
this is dominant process 
in whole spectrum, 
especially in peak z mass 
colored areas indicate 
standard model contributions to 
spectrum 
black points correspond to data 
expected contributions 
standard model scaled 
integrated luminosity 
data we used 
one see this plot, that data 
match well distribution expected 
standard model alone 
presence a heavy z boson would manifest 
a bump in tail distribution, 
shown here simulated rates 
three different possible masses 
in absence bump, 
limits set masses 
production cross sections 
heavy z bosons 
to increase number 
events in tails, 
we try to use many 
final states possible 
a natural one in this case, 
is electron final state 
here is invariant spectrum 
electronpositron pairs atlas 
despite differences, 
picture is similar 
everything we measure 
carries uncertainties 
originate systematic 
effects associated methods 
limited available statistics 
searches also affected 
uncertainties, 
though statistical uncertainties 
important in this case 
searches typically 
improve using data 
this is demonstrated in this slide, 
compare lepton pair spectra 
luminosities differing 
a factor roughly 
heavy z boson search 
given hints new physics yet 
hadron colliders 
bump searches 
successful in past 
a well known one is higgs search, 
effectively a bump search 
atlas cms scientists looked 
a bump in photon pair 
innvariant mass spectrum 
we already seen this 
example in video 
is interesting to see in 
this demonstration 
statistics make a difference 
in picture spectrum, 
lead to a discovery 
beyond higgs mass, photon pair mass 
spectrum is continuously scanned 
new bumps that could indicate 
presence new phenomena 
a potential bump hinted in 
data mass gev 
significance excess low, so 
search 
conclusive that point 
spectrum scanned 
date became available in 
excess increased 
proportionally to increasing 
luminosity 
thus concluded that bump 
due to a statistical fluctuation 
you see that a firm 
discovery is difficult to make, 
strict requirements 
significance a convincing signal 
must respected concluding 
this concludes this video 
in next video, we will discuss 
another type searches, tail searches
