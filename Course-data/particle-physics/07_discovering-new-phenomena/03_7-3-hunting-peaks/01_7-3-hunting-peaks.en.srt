2
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,668
In this module,
we will discuss searches for

3
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:16,587
new phenomenon beyond the known ones
described by the standard model.

4
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:19,249
In this video, we will talk about bump hunting.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,690
After watching this video, you will
know how we look for new resonances

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,440
in hadron collider data.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,170
How such signal choice led in
the past to important discoveries.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,099
And the impact of statistics for searches.

9
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:40,556
We use the data we collect in hadron
colliders for measurements of processes

10
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:44,970
predicted by the standard model and
for searches for new physics.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,870
We typically measure the cross-section
of a process, the mass of a particle, or

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,710
other properties.

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,910
The searches are typically split
in bump searches or tail searches.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,520
Measurements always precede searches.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,950
It is the confidence that we
know well the standard model and

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,320
what it predicts that
enables us to look beyond.

17
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:13,845
One of the things we measure in our data
is the rate of production of a specific

18
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:17,135
process which allows us to
determine its cross section.

19
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,789
It is given by the formula you have
already seen in previous videos.

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,250
The cross section of the process, for
example production of a Z boson, times

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,620
the branching ratio for a specific decay,
for example to a di-muon pair, is equal

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,300
to the number of events corresponding
to the exact same process divided by

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,580
three numbers that remove biases related
to the way the measurement is performed.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,430
The acceptance, indicating the fraction
of signal events passing selection

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,610
requirements we're applying to the data.

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,850
The reconstruction efficiency of the
relevant objects, muons in our example, and

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,000
the integrated luminosity indicating the
amount of incoming particles we have used.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,400
In the numerator we have to subtract
from the total number of events

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,260
the expected number of background events.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,540
These are the events producing the same
signature, a di-muon pair in our example,

31
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,100
but resulting from other processes,
different to our process of interest.

32
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,530
The Z boson was discovered in
proton-antiproton collisions at CERN in 1994

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,800
as a small bump around its mass
value as shown in the left plot.

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,400
What constituted a major discovery back
at the time, is a well established

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,450
process now, for which we can make precise
measurements and measure properties,

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,790
such as the cross-section.

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,026
The plot on the right
shows how a mass peak for

38
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:57,400
Z bosons decaying to two muons looks
like in early ATLAS data back in 2010.

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,891
Despite the small amount of
data available at that time,

40
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:05,922
it is remarkable how this compares to the
same topology when the Z was discovered.

41
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,666
This established the lepton pair signature

42
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,715
as one with which many particles
have been discovered over time.

43
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:21,565
It is one of the key signatures we use in
hadron colliders to search for new peaks.

44
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:24,525
Primarily, in the high mass region now.

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,760
This is how the muon pair mass
spectrum looks like in ATLAS.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,370
starting from just below
the Z mass peak and

47
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,260
extending up to the highest
values we have data for.

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,470
The blue area indicates
the contribution to this distribution

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,509
from a Z boson decaying to two muons.

50
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,240
This is the dominant process
in the whole spectrum,

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,764
and especially in the peak at the Z mass.

52
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,980
Other colored areas indicate other
standard model contributions to

53
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,570
the spectrum.

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,390
The black points correspond to data.

55
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,710
Expected contributions from
the standard model have been scaled

56
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,630
by the same integrated luminosity
as for the data we have used.

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,470
One can see from this plot, that the data
match very well the distribution expected

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,786
from the standard model alone.

59
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:23,160
Presence of a heavy Zâ€™ boson would manifest itself
as a bump in the tail of the distribution,

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,860
shown here with simulated rates for
three different possible masses.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,422
In the absence of any bump,
limits are set on the masses and

62
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:34,050
production cross sections of
the heavy Z bosons.

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,470
To increase the number
of events in the tails,

64
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,220
we try to use as many
final states as possible.

65
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,060
A natural one in this case,
is the electron final state.

66
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:53,810
Here is the invariant spectrum of
electron-positron pairs from ATLAS.

67
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,969
Despite some differences,
the picture is very similar.

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,870
Everything we measure
carries uncertainties.

69
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,710
These originate from both systematic
effects associated with our methods

70
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,660
and the limited available statistics.

71
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,830
Searches are also affected
by uncertainties,

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,880
though statistical uncertainties
are more important in this case.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,133
Our searches typically
improve when using more data.

74
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,625
This is demonstrated in this slide,
where compare the lepton pair spectra with

75
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,970
luminosities differing by
a factor of roughly 100.

76
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,100
The heavy Z boson search has not
given any hints for new physics yet

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,550
at hadron colliders.

78
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,680
Other bump searches have been
more successful in the past.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,310
A very well known one is the Higgs search,

80
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,590
which was effectively a bump search.

81
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,110
ATLAS and CMS scientists looked for

82
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,770
a bump in the photon pair
innvariant mass spectrum.

83
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,430
We have already seen this
example in video 6.12.

84
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,296
It is interesting to see in
this demonstration how more and

85
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:11,858
more statistics make a difference
in the picture of the spectrum,

86
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,459
and lead to a discovery.

87
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:32,936
Beyond the Higgs mass, the photon pair mass
spectrum is continuously scanned for

88
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:36,729
new bumps that could indicate
the presence of new phenomena.

89
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,480
A potential bump was hinted in the 2015
data at the mass of about 750 GeV.

90
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,551
The significance of the excess was low, so

91
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,805
the search was not
conclusive at that point.

92
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:57,270
The spectrum was scanned again when
more date became available in 2016.

93
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,650
The excess had not increased
proportionally to the increasing

94
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,080
luminosity.

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,940
It was thus concluded that the bump had
been due to a statistical fluctuation.

96
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,210
You see that a firm
discovery is difficult to make,

97
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,240
and strict requirements on
the significance of a convincing signal

98
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
must be respected before concluding.

99
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,148
This concludes this video.

100
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:26,890
In the next video, we will discuss
another type of searches, tail searches.

101
