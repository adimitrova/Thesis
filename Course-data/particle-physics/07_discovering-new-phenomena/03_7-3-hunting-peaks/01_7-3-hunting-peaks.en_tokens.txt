in
this
module
,
we
will
discuss
searches
for
new
phenomenon
beyond
the
known
ones
described
by
the
standard
model
.
in
this
video
,
we
will
talk
about
bump
hunting
.
after
watching
this
video
,
you
will
know
how
we
look
for
new
resonances
in
hadron
collider
data
.
how
such
signal
choice
led
in
the
past
to
important
discoveries
.
and
the
impact
of
statistics
for
searches
.
we
use
the
data
we
collect
in
hadron
colliders
for
measurements
of
processes
predicted
by
the
standard
model
and
for
searches
for
new
physics
.
we
typically
measure
the
cross-section
of
a
process
,
the
mass
of
a
particle
,
or
other
properties
.
the
searches
are
typically
split
in
bump
searches
or
tail
searches
.
measurements
always
precede
searches
.
it
is
the
confidence
that
we
know
well
the
standard
model
and
what
it
predicts
that
enables
us
to
look
beyond
.
one
of
the
things
we
measure
in
our
data
is
the
rate
of
production
of
a
specific
process
which
allows
us
to
determine
its
cross
section
.
it
is
given
by
the
formula
you
have
already
seen
in
previous
videos
.
the
cross
section
of
the
process
,
for
example
production
of
a
z
boson
,
times
the
branching
ratio
for
a
specific
decay
,
for
example
to
a
di-muon
pair
,
is
equal
to
the
number
of
events
corresponding
to
the
exact
same
process
divided
by
three
numbers
that
remove
biases
related
to
the
way
the
measurement
is
performed
.
the
acceptance
,
indicating
the
fraction
of
signal
events
passing
selection
requirements
we
're
applying
to
the
data
.
the
reconstruction
efficiency
of
the
relevant
objects
,
muons
in
our
example
,
and
the
integrated
luminosity
indicating
the
amount
of
incoming
particles
we
have
used
.
in
the
numerator
we
have
to
subtract
from
the
total
number
of
events
the
expected
number
of
background
events
.
these
are
the
events
producing
the
same
signature
,
a
di-muon
pair
in
our
example
,
but
resulting
from
other
processes
,
different
to
our
process
of
interest
.
the
z
boson
was
discovered
in
proton-antiproton
collisions
at
cern
in
1994
as
a
small
bump
around
its
mass
value
as
shown
in
the
left
plot
.
what
constituted
a
major
discovery
back
at
the
time
,
is
a
well
established
process
now
,
for
which
we
can
make
precise
measurements
and
measure
properties
,
such
as
the
cross-section
.
the
plot
on
the
right
shows
how
a
mass
peak
for
z
bosons
decaying
to
two
muons
looks
like
in
early
atlas
data
back
in
2010.
despite
the
small
amount
of
data
available
at
that
time
,
it
is
remarkable
how
this
compares
to
the
same
topology
when
the
z
was
discovered
.
this
established
the
lepton
pair
signature
as
one
with
which
many
particles
have
been
discovered
over
time
.
it
is
one
of
the
key
signatures
we
use
in
hadron
colliders
to
search
for
new
peaks
.
primarily
,
in
the
high
mass
region
now
.
this
is
how
the
muon
pair
mass
spectrum
looks
like
in
atlas
.
starting
from
just
below
the
z
mass
peak
and
extending
up
to
the
highest
values
we
have
data
for
.
the
blue
area
indicates
the
contribution
to
this
distribution
from
a
z
boson
decaying
to
two
muons
.
this
is
the
dominant
process
in
the
whole
spectrum
,
and
especially
in
the
peak
at
the
z
mass
.
other
colored
areas
indicate
other
standard
model
contributions
to
the
spectrum
.
the
black
points
correspond
to
data
.
expected
contributions
from
the
standard
model
have
been
scaled
by
the
same
integrated
luminosity
as
for
the
data
we
have
used
.
one
can
see
from
this
plot
,
that
the
data
match
very
well
the
distribution
expected
from
the
standard
model
alone
.
presence
of
a
heavy
zÃ¢ÂÂ
boson
would
manifest
itself
as
a
bump
in
the
tail
of
the
distribution
,
shown
here
with
simulated
rates
for
three
different
possible
masses
.
in
the
absence
of
any
bump
,
limits
are
set
on
the
masses
and
production
cross
sections
of
the
heavy
z
bosons
.
to
increase
the
number
of
events
in
the
tails
,
we
try
to
use
as
many
final
states
as
possible
.
a
natural
one
in
this
case
,
is
the
electron
final
state
.
here
is
the
invariant
spectrum
of
electron-positron
pairs
from
atlas
.
despite
some
differences
,
the
picture
is
very
similar
.
everything
we
measure
carries
uncertainties
.
these
originate
from
both
systematic
effects
associated
with
our
methods
and
the
limited
available
statistics
.
searches
are
also
affected
by
uncertainties
,
though
statistical
uncertainties
are
more
important
in
this
case
.
our
searches
typically
improve
when
using
more
data
.
this
is
demonstrated
in
this
slide
,
where
compare
the
lepton
pair
spectra
with
luminosities
differing
by
a
factor
of
roughly
100.
the
heavy
z
boson
search
has
not
given
any
hints
for
new
physics
yet
at
hadron
colliders
.
other
bump
searches
have
been
more
successful
in
the
past
.
a
very
well
known
one
is
the
higgs
search
,
which
was
effectively
a
bump
search
.
atlas
and
cms
scientists
looked
for
a
bump
in
the
photon
pair
innvariant
mass
spectrum
.
we
have
already
seen
this
example
in
video
6.12.
it
is
interesting
to
see
in
this
demonstration
how
more
and
more
statistics
make
a
difference
in
the
picture
of
the
spectrum
,
and
lead
to
a
discovery
.
beyond
the
higgs
mass
,
the
photon
pair
mass
spectrum
is
continuously
scanned
for
new
bumps
that
could
indicate
the
presence
of
new
phenomena
.
a
potential
bump
was
hinted
in
the
2015
data
at
the
mass
of
about
750
gev
.
the
significance
of
the
excess
was
low
,
so
the
search
was
not
conclusive
at
that
point
.
the
spectrum
was
scanned
again
when
more
date
became
available
in
2016.
the
excess
had
not
increased
proportionally
to
the
increasing
luminosity
.
it
was
thus
concluded
that
the
bump
had
been
due
to
a
statistical
fluctuation
.
you
see
that
a
firm
discovery
is
difficult
to
make
,
and
strict
requirements
on
the
significance
of
a
convincing
signal
must
be
respected
before
concluding
.
this
concludes
this
video
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
discuss
another
type
of
searches
,
tail
searches
.
