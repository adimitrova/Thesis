in this module we treating 
basics particle acceleration 
detection methods 
in this second video, 
we treat acceleration 
focusing mechanisms inside accelerators 
watching this video, you will 
able to answer following questions 
main components 
an accelerator work 
a complex accelerators 
like that cern work together 
to achieve highest energies 
highest intensities 
inside an accelerator, 
particles move in an evacuated tube 
this is to prevent 
interacting air molecules 
lose energy, transformed 
even if dont, we still to 
supply radio frequency acceleration, 
even in storage ring if we want 
to keep beam energy constant 
this is an accelerated 
charged particle 
loses fraction energy in 
form radiation emitting photons 
this process is called bremsstrahlung, 
process that produces 
photons in an xray tube 
in a tube, 
electron cathode ray beam is stopped 
an inclined watercooled target 
energy electron is 
typically ten kiloelectron volts 
thus yield xray photons 
a comparable energy 
also lateral acceleration creates 
bremsstrahlung, namely synchrotron radiation 
relativistic particles, 
lost power per turn p is 
proportional to fourth power 
relativistic factor gamma, 
inversely proportional 
to radius curvature rho 
is large light particles 
circulating in small orbits 
this loss must replaced 
constantly to get a stable beam 
in an orbit constant radius 
synchrotron radiation is a nuisance 
one uses to produce 
monochromatic photons 
swiss light source paulscherrerinstitute 
in villigen is a source high brightness 
brightness light based an electron synchrotron 
giga electron volts 
is beam lines used researching 
material science, biology, chemistry 
accelerating electric field is generated 
a vacuum tube amplifier, klystron 
an intense electron beam is accelerated, 
bunched in a resonant cavity 
in a second resonant cavity 
electron kinetic energy is 
extracted in form 
a radio frequency wave 
modern klystrons normally several 
amplification stages 
beam is held a circular 
path dipole magnets 
transverse focusing beam is 
done quadruple magnetic fields 
a low quadruple component is normally 
present even in a dipole magnet 
focalizing forces come a slight 
horizontal component magnetic 
field, changes sign one passe 
to orbital plane 
alternating 
this quadruple configuration 
one is rotated degrees, 
focalization is obtained 
in horizontal 
vertical directions transverse to beam 
magnets dipolar quadruple fields 
thus complany in accelerator ring 
two coils create a dipole field, 
four create a quadruple field shown 
today coils normally 
superconducting to minimize 
resistive loss 
focalization is also 
needed in longitudinal direction 
reason is that particles 
must arrive synchronously 
to acceleration points 
thus, injected in short packets 
if arrive radio frequency 
resonators increasing slope 
electric field, phase remains stable 
a particle arriving a slight 
delay compared to ideal phase 
will see a field that is 
stronger average field 
a particle a slight advance will 
contrary see less accelerating field 
in this way, 
particles will automatically 
oscillate around ideal phase 
we lower energy losses synchrotron 
radiation increasing radius curvature rho, 
weakening time dipole field 
asymptotically, we 
let rho tend to infinity, 
resulting in a linear accelerator 
almost every accelerator complex 
begins a device 
much vacuum tube contains 
beam is a resonant 
structure radio frequency 
a traveling electromagnetic wave 
between resonant cavities, 
there spacers made conductive tubes 
length must follow velocity 
accelerated particles, ie 
equal to velocity times 
half period radio frequency 
is also necessary that 
passing in a unshielded portion cavity, 
electric field 
desired sign value 
velocity particle is 
sufficiently close to speed light, 
spacing becomes constant 
todays powerful accelerators 
mainly working in synchrotron mode 
powerful, 
large hadron collider, 
in operation since 
is part a complex accelerators 
to obtain maximum energy luminosity 
in , energy 
proton beam tev 
in , raised to tev 
a technical interruption, 
that started in february , 
operation resumed in 
tev per beam 
this corresponds to impressive 
energy j 
path particles

short cern video a 
in next video we 
will visit cern 
to discuss key components lhc
