cern accelerator complex 
is a chain machines, 
accelerate particles 
to increasing energy 
machine increases energy 
a particle beam injecting 
next machine 
chains accelerators 
equipped experimental hall 
in beams used 
fixed target experiments lower energy 
source protons is a simple 
bottle gaseous hydrogen 
an electric field ionizes 
hydrogen atoms to obtain protons 
linac , 
first link in chain, accelerates 
protons to an energy mev 
beam is injected 
ps injector synchrotron, 
is called ps booster 
accelerates protons to gev 
accumulates 
theyre injected 
proton synchrotron, 
ps, carries 
beam to gev 
protons sent to 
super proton synchrotron, 
sps in 
turn accelerated to gev energy 
finally, protons 
sent to two beam tubes 
large hadron collider, lhc 
beam travels clockwise 
in first tube 
counter clockwise in second tube 
takes minutes seconds to 
fill two rings lhc 
minutes protons to reach 
maximum energy today tev 
normal operating conditions, 
beams circulate 
several hours in tubes lhc 
focused pairs 
quadropoles towards 
interaction point 
two beams collide 
inside four detectors 
alice, atlas, cms lhcb 
collision point, 
total energy in center 
mass is tev today 
lhc accelerate 
protons, also heavy ions 
lead ions lhc extracted 
a vaporized lead source 
passed a linac 
collected 
accelerated ring 
low energy ions 
path is that 
protons end this path, 
ions reach maximum energy
