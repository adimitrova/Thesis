2
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:15,508
In this module we are treating
the basics of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,125
detection methods.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,480
In this second video,
we treat the acceleration and

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,740
focusing mechanisms inside accelerators.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,360
After watching this video, you will be
able to answer the following questions.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,270
What are the main components of
an accelerator and how do they work?

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,840
And how does a complex of accelerators
like that at CERN work together

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,250
to achieve the highest energies and
highest intensities?

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,800
Inside an accelerator,
particles move in an evacuated tube.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,120
And this is to prevent them from
interacting with air molecules and

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,270
lose energy, or be transformed.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,310
Even if they don't, we still have to  
supply radio frequency acceleration,

14
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,610
even in the storage ring if we want
to keep the beam energy constant.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,450
This is because an accelerated
charged particle

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,370
loses some fraction of its energy in
the form of radiation by emitting photons.

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,270
This process is called bremsstrahlung,

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,110
the same process that produces
photons in an X-ray tube.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,740
In such a tube,

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,120
the electron cathode ray beam is stopped
by an inclined water-cooled target.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,566
The energy of the electron is
typically ten kiloelectron volts.

22
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:33,140
They thus yield X-ray photons of
a comparable energy.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,013
But also lateral acceleration creates 
bremsstrahlung, namely synchrotron radiation.

24
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,890
For relativistic particles,

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,820
the lost power per turn P is
proportional to the fourth power

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,021
of the relativistic factor gamma,

27
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:54,637
and the inversely proportional
to the radius of curvature rho.

28
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:58,136
It is large for light particles
circulating in small orbits.

29
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:02,817
This loss must be replaced
constantly to get a stable beam

30
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:05,472
in an orbit of constant radius.

31
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:10,120
But synchrotron radiation is more than a nuisance.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,955
One uses it to produce
monochromatic photons.

33
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:19,153
The Swiss Light Source at the Paul-Scherrer-Institute
in Villigen is a source of high brightness

34
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:26,370
brightness light based on an electron synchrotron 
of 2.4 giga electron volts.

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,510
Is beam lines are used researching
material science, biology, and chemistry.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,660
The accelerating electric field is generated
by a vacuum tube amplifier, the klystron.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,645
An intense electron beam is accelerated,
then bunched in a resonant cavity.

38
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:49,235
In a second resonant cavity
the electron kinetic energy is

39
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,743
extracted in the form of
a radio frequency wave.

40
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:59,040
Modern klystrons have normally several
such amplification stages.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,710
The beam is held on a circular
path by dipole magnets.

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,180
The transverse focusing of the beam is
done by quadruple magnetic fields.

43
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,525
A low quadruple component is normally
present even in a dipole magnet.

44
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:18,917
The focalizing forces come from a slight
horizontal component of the magnetic

45
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:23,920
field, which changes sign as one passe from
below to above the orbital plane.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,227
By alternating

47
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:30,900
this quadruple configuration with
one which is rotated 90 degrees,

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,060
the focalization is obtained
in both horizontal and

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,430
vertical directions transverse to the beam.

50
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,830
Magnets with dipolar and quadruple fields
thus the complany in the accelerator ring.

51
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,734
Two coils have create a dipole field,
four create a quadruple field as shown.

52
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:54,316
Today these coils are normally
superconducting to minimize

53
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,670
resistive loss.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,020
But focalization is also
needed in the longitudinal direction.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,680
The reason is that the particles
must arrive synchronously

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,840
to acceleration points.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,770
Thus, they are injected in short packets.
If they arrive at radio frequency

58
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,090
resonators on the increasing slope of the
electric field, their phase remains stable.

59
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,380
A particle arriving with a slight
delay compared to the ideal phase

60
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,750
will see a field that is
stronger than the average field.

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,900
A particle with a slight advance will on
the contrary see less accelerating field.

62
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,621
In this way,

63
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,499
the particles will automatically
oscillate around the ideal phase.

64
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:48,795
We can lower energy losses from synchrotron
radiation by increasing the radius or curvature rho,

65
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:52,620
weakening at the same time the dipole field.

66
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,940
Asymptotically, we can
let rho tend to infinity,

67
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,300
resulting in a linear accelerator.

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,010
Almost every accelerator complex
begins with such a device.

69
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,660
Much of the vacuum tube which contains
the beam itself is a resonant

70
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,409
structure of radio frequency with
a traveling electromagnetic wave.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,240
Between the resonant cavities,
there are spacers made of conductive tubes.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,860
Their length must follow the velocity
of the accelerated particles, i.e.

73
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,880
they should be equal to the velocity times
half the period of the radio frequency.

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,235
It is also necessary that when
passing in a unshielded portion of the cavity,

75
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:38,206
the electric field has
the desired sign and value.

76
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:43,830
Once the velocity of the particle is
sufficiently close to the speed of light,

77
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,730
the spacing becomes constant.

78
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,250
Today's powerful accelerators
are mainly working in synchrotron mode.

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,590
The most powerful,

80
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,250
the Large Hadron Collider,
has been in operation since 2008.

81
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,840
It is part of a complex of accelerators
to obtain maximum energy and luminosity.

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,100
In 2011 and 12, the energy of the
proton beam was 3.5 TeV.

83
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,040
In 2012, it was raised to 4 TeV.

84
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,890
And after a technical interruption,
that started in February 2013,

85
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,360
the operation resumed in 2015 with
7 TeV per beam.

86
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,550
This corresponds to the impressive
energy of 1.12 ÂµJ.

87
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,100
The path of particles through
the complex is shown in

88
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,200
the short CERN video 3.2a.

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,893
In the next video we
will visit CERN

90
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:51,916
to discuss the key components of the LHC

91
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:57,113
with Prof. Tobias Golling of University of Geneva.
