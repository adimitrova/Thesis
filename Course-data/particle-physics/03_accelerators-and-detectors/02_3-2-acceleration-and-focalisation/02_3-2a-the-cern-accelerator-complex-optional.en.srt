2
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:13,606
The CERN accelerator complex
is a chain of machines,

3
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:16,454
which accelerate particles
to increasing energy.

4
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:20,893
Each machine increases the energy of
a particle beam before injecting it into

5
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:21,995
the next machine.

6
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:25,721
Most of the chain's accelerators are
equipped with their own experimental hall

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:29,370
in which the beams are used for
fixed target experiments at lower energy.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,723
The source of protons is a simple
bottle of gaseous hydrogen.

9
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:39,390
An electric field ionizes
the hydrogen atoms to obtain protons.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,134
The Linac 2,

11
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:44,365
the first link in the chain, accelerates
the protons up to an energy of 50 MeV.

12
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,450
The beam is then injected into
the PS injector synchrotron,

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,540
which is called the PS Booster.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,556
It accelerates protons up to 1.4 GeV and

15
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,405
accumulates them.

16
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:11,774
They're then injected

17
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:18,589
into the Proton Synchrotron,

18
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:23,045
the PS, which carries

19
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:28,559
the beam up to 25 GeV.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,145
The protons are then sent to
the Super Proton Synchrotron,

21
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:43,810
the SPS where they are in
turn accelerated to 450 GeV energy.

22
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,534
And finally, the protons
are sent to the two beam tubes of

23
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:09,609
the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC.

24
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:12,080
The beam travels clockwise
in the first tube and

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,130
counter clockwise in the second tube.

26
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:23,990
It takes about 4 minutes 20 seconds to
fill each of the two rings of the LHC

27
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,668
and 20 minutes for the protons to reach
their maximum energy of today 6.5 TeV.

28
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:32,435
Under normal operating conditions,

29
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:36,937
the beams circulate for
several hours in the tubes of the LHC.

30
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:42,903
They are focused by pairs

31
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:48,586
of quadropoles towards

32
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:54,559
the interaction point.

33
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,130
The two beams collide
inside four detectors.

34
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,727
ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.

35
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,093
At the collision point,

36
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,070
the total energy in the center of
mass is 13 TeV today.

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,697
But the LHC does not only accelerate
protons, but also heavy ions.

38
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:31,346
The lead ions of the LHC are extracted
from a vaporized lead source and

39
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:34,874
passed through a Linac 3
before being collected and

40
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:38,001
accelerated into the ring
of low energy ions.

41
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:42,682
Then their path is the same as that for
protons. At the end of this path,

42
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,880
the ions reach their maximum energy.

43
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,644
