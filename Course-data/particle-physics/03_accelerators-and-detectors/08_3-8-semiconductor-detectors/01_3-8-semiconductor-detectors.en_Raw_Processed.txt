in this module, we touch basics 
particle acceleration 
detection methods 
in this video, we will continue 
discussion particle detection 
techniques semiconductor devices 
watched this video, you will 
know semiconductor detectors detect 
ionization caused 
traversing charged particles 
this is used to 
identify charged particles 
to measure trajectories 
this particular type ionization 
detectors uses properties 
semiconductors to detect measure 
dedx charged particles 
a charged particle 
traverses a semiconductor, 
will create an electronhole pair 
since conduction band is 
close to valence band, 
takes ev dedx to create a pair 
compared to ev to ionize a gas atom 
charges detected 
applying an electric field 
semiconductor detectors 
good energy resolution 
compact since 
made a solid 
thin a required thickness 
much smaller additional length 
special resolution is in 
order micrometers, ideal 
a tracking detectors 
also produce fast signals, 
however expensive 
fragile to make mechanical, 
chemical electrical impacts, 
performance is 
degraded irradiation 
basis a semiconductor detector 
is a pn junction reverse bias 
two different semi conductor types, 
n p, in contact, 
diffusion creates a zone free charge 
carriers around contact surface 
a depletion zone forms junction, 
creating a potential barrier, 
prevents conduction 
between two semiconductors 
application a reverse bias 
voltage widens depletion zone, 
this is semiconductor diodes work 
passage ionizing particles 
liberates electronhole pairs in 
depletion zone 
charge collected to ends, 
diode conducts a small current 
a short time 
semiconductor detectors a good 
efficiency since ev 
necessary to create 
a single electronhole pair 
so, detectors ten 
times sensitive a gas, 
a hundred times 
sensitive a scintillator 
it, therefore, a lower detection 
threshold a better energy resolution 
since primary ionization 
means less signal fluctuations 
threshold dedx is 
low, so that is a good linearity 
however, to measure 
highly ionizing particles 
requires a large dynamic range 
readout electronics since dedx 
is proportional to square 
charge particle 
even if junction is in reverse bias, 
there is still a small current 
order na junction 
this is called leakage current 
is due to motion 
minority careers, effects 
impurities surface effects 
time electrical signal 
is order nano seconds 
so semi conductor detectors fast 
scintillators we will 
discuss in next video 
energy deposition 
dedx is local 
therefore, electrodes 
structured in one 
sides to locate 
passage particles 
distance metalized structures, 
called strips, is typically 
order m 
in this picture, you see an example 
silicone microstrip sensor 
ams detector is operating 
international space station 
alice detector operating 
large hadron collider 
channel metallic structure 
must connected to readout 
electronics micro bonding 
applications a semiconductor detector 
in particle physics include following 
used arranged in layers to measure 
trajectory charged particles 
this profits development in 
micro electronic technology to fabricate 
precise structures silicon 
semiconductor materials 
example microstrip detectors 
used in atlas 
large hadron collider in ams 
pixel detectors used 
first time lhc 
charged coupled devices, ccd, used in 
digital cameras, many others 
semi conductor detectors also 
measure deposited element 
excellent resolution allows 
identification charge 
penetrating particle 
in a tracking device 
also sensitive 
elements in a calorimeter 
this application is limited 
thickness depletion 
zone goes micrometers 
to order millimeters 
maximum chip size that produced 
is centimeters squared 
here is an example a silicon wafer, 
so big rectangle center 
sides, 
testing circuits 
allow to test quality 
sensor using 
to assemble a detecting unit 
using it, 
one must cut sensor 
this is an example a cut sensor 
usually, one connects several 
sensors together to build 
detection unit like this 
one there two 
silicon sensors connected 
middle micro bonding 
one end micro bonding connects 
to readout electronics 
example applications 
using semiconductor 
sensors will shown in video 
in next video, well first talk
