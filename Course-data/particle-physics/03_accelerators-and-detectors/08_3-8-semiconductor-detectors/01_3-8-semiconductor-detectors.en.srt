2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,766
In this module, we touch the basics
of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,690
detection methods.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,670
In this video, we will continue our
discussion on particle detection

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,956
techniques with semiconductor devices.

6
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:29,580
After having watched this video, you will
know how semiconductor detectors detect

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,210
the ionization caused by
traversing charged particles.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,790
And how this is used to
identify charged particles and

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,930
to measure their trajectories.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,640
This particular type of ionization
detectors uses the properties of

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,410
semiconductors to detect and measure
dE/dx of charged particles.

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,100
When a charged particle
traverses a semiconductor,

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,110
it will create an electron-hole pair.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,270
Since the conduction band is
close to the valence band,

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,820
it takes only 3 eV of dE/dx to create a pair

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,230
compared to the 30 eV to ionize a gas atom.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,140
The charges can be detected by
applying an electric field.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,535
Semiconductor detectors have
very good energy resolution.

19
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,630
They are compact since
they are made of a solid.

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,730
They are thin with a required thickness
much smaller than their additional length.

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,407
The special resolution is in
the order of micrometers, ideal for

22
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,200
a tracking detectors.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,790
And also they produce fast signals,
however they are expensive.

24
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,041
They are fragile to make mechanical,
chemical and electrical impacts,

25
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:47,480
and their performance is
degraded by irradiation.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,423
The basis of a semi-conductor detector
is a p-n junction with reverse bias.

27
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:56,818
When two different semi conductor types,
n and p, are in contact,

28
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:02,240
diffusion creates a zone free of charge
carriers around the contact surface.

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,750
A depletion zone forms at the junction,
creating a potential barrier,

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,780
which prevents conduction
between the two semiconductors.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,170
The application of a reverse bias
voltage widens the depletion zone,

32
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,180
and this is how semiconductor diodes work.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,103
The passage of ionizing particles
liberates electron-hole pairs in

34
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:25,060
the depletion zone.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,560
Charge are collected to both ends, and

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,700
the diode conducts a small current for
a short time.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,860
Semiconductor detectors have a good
efficiency since only 3 eV

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,930
are necessary to create
a single electron-hole pair.

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,462
So, these detectors are ten
times more sensitive than a gas,

40
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:49,450
and a hundred times more
sensitive than a scintillator.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,650
It, therefore, has a lower detection
threshold and a better energy resolution

42
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,270
since more primary ionization
means less signal fluctuations.

43
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,146
The threshold for dE/dx is
very low, so that is a good linearity.

44
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:08,762
However, to measure
highly ionizing particles

45
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:13,363
requires a large dynamic range of
readout electronics since dE/dx

46
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:18,840
is proportional to the square
of the charge of the particle.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,900
Even if the junction is in reverse bias,

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,100
there is still a small current of the
order of nA through the junction.

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,560
This is called leakage current and
it is due to the motion

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,480
of minority careers, effects
of impurities and surface effects.

51
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,630
The time of the electrical signal
is of the order of nano seconds.

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,007
So semi conductor detectors are as fast as

53
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:51,520
scintillators which we will
discuss in the next video.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,420
The energy deposition by
the dE/dx is very local.

55
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,329
Therefore, the electrodes
can be structured in one or

56
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,290
both sides to locate
the passage of particles.

57
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,420
The distance of metalized structures,

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,420
called strips, is typically of
the order of 50 Âµm.

59
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,947
And in this picture, you see an example
of silicone microstrip sensor

60
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:20,460
of the AMS detector which is operating
on the International Space Station and

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,670
of the ALICE detector operating
at the Large Hadron Collider.

62
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,402
Each channel of the metallic structure
must be connected to the readout

63
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,367
electronics through micro bonding.

64
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:41,960
Applications of a semiconductor detector
in particle physics include the following.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,540
They are used arranged in layers to measure
the trajectory of charged particles.

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,610
And this profits from the development in
micro electronic technology to fabricate

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,020
precise structures on silicon and
other semiconductor materials.

68
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,862
Example are microstrip detectors
used in the ATLAS

69
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:05,170
at the Large Hadron Collider and in AMS.

70
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,230
Pixel detectors which are being used for
the first time at LHC.

71
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,660
Charged coupled devices, CCD, used in
digital cameras, and many others.

72
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,560
Semi conductor detectors also
measure the deposited element.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
Their excellent resolution allows
the identification of the charge of

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,420
the penetrating particle
in a tracking device.

75
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,390
They can also be sensitive
elements in a calorimeter.

76
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,823
This application is only limited
by the thickness of the depletion

77
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:45,180
zone which goes from 50 micrometers
up to order of millimeters and

78
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,217
the maximum chip size that can be produced
which is about 50 centimeters squared.

79
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:56,004
Here is an example of a silicon wafer,

80
00:05:56,004 --> 00:06:00,417
so the big rectangle at the center.
And the sides,

81
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:05,583
they are testing circuits which
allow to test the quality

82
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:11,950
of the sensor before using
it to assemble a detecting unit.

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,310
Before using it,
one must cut the sensor.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,450
And this is an example of a cut sensor.

85
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,620
And usually, one connects several
sensors together to build

86
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,450
the detection unit like this
one where there are two

87
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,240
silicon sensors connected at
the middle by micro bonding and

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,650
at the one end micro bonding connects
them to the readout electronics.

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,504
More example of applications
using semi-conductor

90
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,857
sensors will be shown in video 3.10.

91
00:06:54,857 --> 00:07:00,963
In the next video, we'll first talk about
the scintillators and Cherenkov detectors.
