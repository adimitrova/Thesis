00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:12,438
I will first show you the effect of the Lorentz force

3
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:17,550
with a cathode ray tube 
filled with a rarified gas.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,110
This gas is fluorescent, and thus makes the particle passage visible. 

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,290
A heated filament emits electrons, 

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,780
which are then accelerated by an electric field.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,720
They leave the cathode pointing upwards.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,780
The Helmholtz coils,

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,985
in front of and behind the tube, generate a magnetic field which points towards you. 

10
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:44,725
The electrons are thus deviated towards the center of the tube. 

11
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:51,455
With ambient light, one cannot see the faint fluorescence of the gas. 

12
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,345
When we dim the light, it becomes visible. 

13
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,955
Now I increase the magnetic field strength.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,730
At constant electron momentum, the radius of curvature becomes smaller. 

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,360
The electrons circulate around the magnetic field direction,

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,030
with the cyclotron frequency. 

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,500
If I now reduce the magnetic field strength,

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:29,505
The radius of curvature increases, and the electrons hit the glass of the tube. 

19
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:33,224
Let us quickly calculate the cyclotron frequency with which

20
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:38,224
The electrons circulate in the tube. 

21
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:45,224
The Lorentz force q(v x B) gives us the centripetal force, which makes them follow a circle,

22
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:52,224
if v is orthogonal to B. The absolute value of the force is simply
(evB)

23
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:59,224
and must be equal to mv^2/rho, where rho is the radius of the circle. 

24
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:10,224
This gives us v = e B rho/m, the velocity is thus constant. 

25
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:17,224
The frequency with which they circulate is v/(2 pi rho),

26
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:24,224
which equals (eB)/(2 pi m). This is thus also a constant in the non-relativistic case. 

27
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:26,000
This gives us an angular frequency of (2 pi f)= eB/m, the cyclotron frequency.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,385
