hello, welcome to this third module 
introductory course, well touch 
upon basics particle 
acceleration detection methods 
in this video, 
we will explain physical principles 
linear circular accelerators 
afterwards, you will able to 
answer following questions 
principles particle 
acceleration electromagnetic fields 
an electrostatic 
accelerator work 
cyclotrons 
synchrotrons work 
force acting a particle 
charge e, in an electric field e, 
a magnetic field b, is given 
lorentz force that is quoted in blue 
electric fields used to accelerate 
particles increasing momentum 
magnetic fields serve to deflect 
original direction, 
to store in a ring, 
to focus a beam particles 
simplest accelerator 
electrons is cathode ray tube, 
that you may remember 
grandfathers tv set 
an electron emerging a heated 
filament is accelerated a potential v 
energy outgoing electron 
is obviously v electron volts 
electrostatic accelerators chain 
together stages this type shown in 
this photograph 
energy is limited stability 
high voltage insulation 
thus, exceed 
a few million electron volts 
to reach a higher energy requires that 
projectile passes several times 
an accelerating potential 
simplest circular 
accelerator is cyclotron 
in a uniform constant magnetic field b, 
a particle charge e moves 
a circle radius rho equal to p 
divided eb p is moment 
angular frequency this movement 
is called cyclotron frequency omegac 
is proportion to ratio e 
m particle charge mass 
proportional to magnetic 
field intensity b 
particle is accelerated 
electric field present 
between two d shaped cavities 
this field is provided 
a radio frequency generator 
that frequency is equal 
to cyclotron frequency 
in non relativistic domain, 
this frequency is constant 
circumference orbit increases 
proportional to velocity 
particle 
thus, we inject particles 
in a quasi continuous manner, 
if accelerating rf 
frequencys high 
an even multiple 
cyclotron frequency 
you find a calculation 
cyclotron frequency in video a 
cyclotron limits in 
that velocity particle 
remain proportional to momentum, 
approaches speed light 
in an asymptotic process 
in relativistic limit, 
velocity barely increases 
despite a steady increase in energy 
acceleration radio frequency 
particle revolution frequency dephase 
thus quickly an energy tens 
mev protons 
one must thus adjust radio 
frequency to relativistic velocity 
example, proton cyclotron 
paul scherrer institute in villigen, 
switzerland accelerates protons to 
nearly speed light 
you see a picture this 
accelerator in this photograph 
asymptotic saturation speed 
particle to speed light is, 
contrary, useful, provided that 
radius curvature is held constant 
in this case, rotational frequency, 
again, is independent energy 
this is principle synchrotron 
increasing magnetic field 
proportional to momentum 
particle, 
radius curvature remains constant 
one to fill a large 
volume a magnetic field, 
concentrate inside a vacuum 
chamber, whose shape approximates a ring 
synchrotron frequency becomes 
constant high energies if field b 
is kept proportional to momentum 
we work a constant 
accelerating radio frequency 
rf field is transmitted to 
beam resonant cavities 
synchrotron principle requires 
a certain initial velocity 
sufficiently close to speed light 
beam is thus usually preaccelerated 
injection say, 
a linear accelerator 
acceleration process must stop 
one reaches maximum field 
dipole magnets 
one either extracts beam 
converts accelerator 
a storage ring 
in this latter operational mode, 
provides turn energy 
lost beam via bremsstrahlung 
this loss energy will introduced in 
next section module, video 
separation functions 
concentration components around 
ring, allows to combine two rings 
to construct is called a collider 
a historical example is princeton 
stanford storage ring, an early example 
a particle collider 
worked electrons in two 
rings interact in middle, 
two storage rings touch 
detector rather 
primitive, a spark chamber, 
allow to determine 
scattering angle 
obviously, one also fold two 
accelerators top other, 
even combine if you want to 
collide particles antiparticles 
examples latter type 
colliders tevatron 
fermi national laboratory 
close to chicago in us, 
collided protons 
antiprotons until 
also large electron 
positron collider, lep cern, 
collided electrons positrons 
in operation between 
in tunnel houses 
large hadron collider, lhc cern 
we will return to lhc in 
next video this module
