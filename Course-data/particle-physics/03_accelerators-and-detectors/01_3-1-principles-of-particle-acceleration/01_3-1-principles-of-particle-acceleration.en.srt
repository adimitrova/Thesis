00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:15,452
Hello, and welcome to this third module of
our introductory course, where we'll touch

3
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:19,720
upon the basics of particle
acceleration and detection methods.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,340
In this video,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,250
we will explain the physical principles
of linear and circular accelerators.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,880
Afterwards, you will be able to
answer the following questions.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,380
What are the principles of particle
acceleration by electromagnetic fields?

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,980
How does an electrostatic
accelerator work?

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,590
And how do cyclotrons and
synchrotrons work?

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,820
The force acting on a particle of
charge e, in an electric field E, and

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,050
a magnetic field B, is given by
the Lorentz force that is quoted in blue.

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,650
Electric fields are used to accelerate
particles by increasing their momentum.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,400
Magnetic fields serve to deflect
them from their original direction,

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,390
to store them in a ring, or
to focus a beam of particles.

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,350
The simplest accelerator for
electrons is the cathode ray tube,

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,250
that you may remember from
your grandfather's TV set.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,820
An electron emerging from a heated
filament is accelerated by a potential V.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,420
The energy of the outgoing electron
is then obviously V electron volts.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,360
Electrostatic accelerators chain
together stages of this type as shown in

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,020
this photograph.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,370
Their energy is limited by the stability
of the high voltage insulation.

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,390
Thus, it does not exceed
a few million electron volts.

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,252
To reach a higher energy requires that
the projectile passes several times by

24
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,136
an accelerating potential.

25
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:49,330
The simplest circular
accelerator is the cyclotron.

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,030
In a uniform and constant magnetic field B,
a particle of charge e moves on

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,360
a circle of radius rho equal to p
divided by eB where p is its moment.

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,450
The angular frequency of this movement
is called cyclotron frequency omega_c.

29
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,670
It is proportion to the ratio e over
m of the particle charge and mass and

30
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,850
proportional to the magnetic
field intensity B.

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,620
The particle is accelerated
by the electric field present

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,070
between the two D shaped cavities.

33
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,950
This field is provided by
a radio frequency generator

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,630
such that its frequency is equal
to the cyclotron frequency.

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,570
In the non relativistic domain,

36
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,775
this frequency is constant because
the circumference of the orbit increases

37
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,600
proportional to the velocity
of the particle.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,860
Thus, we can inject particles
in a quasi continuous manner,

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,930
if the accelerating RF
frequency's high and

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,320
an even multiple of
the cyclotron frequency.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,139
You can find a calculation of
the cyclotron frequency in video 3.1a.

42
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,545
The cyclotron has its limits in

43
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:06,302
that the velocity of the particle does not
remain proportional to the momentum, but

44
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:09,530
approaches the speed of light
in an asymptotic process.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,890
In the relativistic limit,

46
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,540
the velocity barely increases
despite a steady increase in energy.

47
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,400
Acceleration radio frequency and
particle revolution frequency dephase

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,900
thus quickly at an energy of some tens
of MeV for protons.

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,704
One must thus adjust the radio
frequency to the relativistic velocity.

50
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:37,611
For example, the proton cyclotron at
the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen,

51
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:42,410
Switzerland accelerates protons to
nearly 80% of the speed of light.

52
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,447
And you can see a picture of this
accelerator in this photograph.

53
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:53,096
The asymptotic saturation of the speed of
the particle to the speed of light is, on

54
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:58,100
the contrary, very useful, provided that
the radius of curvature is held constant.

55
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,679
In this case, the rotational frequency,
again, is independent of energy.

56
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,540
This is the principle of the synchrotron.

57
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,740
By increasing the magnetic field
proportional to the momentum of

58
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,260
the particle,
the radius of curvature remains constant.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,530
One does not have to fill a large
volume with a magnetic field, but

60
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,120
can concentrate it inside a vacuum
chamber, whose shape approximates a ring.

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,510
The synchrotron frequency becomes
constant at high energies if the field B

62
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,130
is kept proportional to the momentum.

63
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,510
We can then work with a constant
accelerating radio frequency.

64
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,439
The RF field is transmitted to
the beam by resonant cavities.

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,890
The synchrotron principle requires
a certain initial velocity

66
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,600
sufficiently close to the speed of light.

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,630
The beam is thus usually pre-accelerated
before injection by say,

68
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
a linear accelerator.

69
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,688
The acceleration process must stop
when one reaches the maximum field of

70
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:56,954
the dipole magnets.

71
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,284
One then either extracts the beam or

72
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,480
converts the accelerator
into a storage ring.

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,980
In this latter operational mode,

74
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,540
it provides at each turn just the energy
lost by the beam via bremsstrahlung.

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,774
This loss of energy will be introduced in
the next section of the module, video 3.2.

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,739
The separation of functions and
the concentration of the components around

77
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:25,360
the ring, allows to combine two rings
to construct what is called a collider.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,900
A historical example is the Princeton-
Stanford storage ring, an early example

79
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,290
of a particle collider.

80
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,820
It worked with electrons in the two
rings which interact in the middle,

81
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,760
where the two storage rings touch.

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,470
The detector was rather
primitive, a spark chamber, but

83
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,890
it did allow to determine
the scattering angle.

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,910
Obviously, one can also fold the two
accelerators on top of each other, or

85
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,540
even combine them if you want to
collide particles and antiparticles.

86
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,474
Examples of the latter type of
colliders are the Tevatron at

87
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,328
the Fermi National Laboratory
close to Chicago in the US,

88
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:07,199
which collided protons and
antiprotons until 2011.

89
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,842
And also the Large Electron
Positron collider, LEP at CERN,

90
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:13,870
which collided electrons and positrons.

91
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,910
It was in operation between 1989 and

92
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,280
2000 in the tunnel which now houses
the Large Hadron Collider, LHC at CERN.

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,054
We will return to the LHC in
the next video of this module.
