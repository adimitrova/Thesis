i will first show you effect lorentz force 
a cathode ray tube 
filled a rarified gas 
this gas is fluorescent, thus makes particle passage visible 
a heated filament emits electrons, 
accelerated an electric field 
leave cathode pointing upwards 
helmholtz coils, 
in front behind tube, generate a magnetic field points towards you 
electrons thus deviated towards center tube 
ambient light, one cannot see faint fluorescence gas 
we dim light, becomes visible 
i increase magnetic field strength 
constant electron momentum, radius curvature becomes smaller 
electrons circulate around magnetic field direction, 
cyclotron frequency 
if i reduce magnetic field strength, 
radius curvature increases, electrons hit glass tube 
let us quickly calculate cyclotron frequency 
electrons circulate in tube 
lorentz force qv x b gives us centripetal force, makes follow a circle, 
if v is orthogonal to b absolute value force is simply 
evb 
must equal to mvrho, rho is radius circle 
this gives us v e b rhom, velocity is thus constant 
frequency circulate is v pi rho, 
equals eb pi m this is thus also a constant in nonrelativistic case 
this gives us an angular frequency pi f ebm, cyclotron frequency
