2
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,230
In this video, I will give you a little insight 

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,900
into how one uses the particle detectors

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,780
which we have introduced in Module 3

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:30,030
to detect charged particles and light. 

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:37,340
At the end of this video you will know how one integrates 

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,890
semiconductor sensors into so-called particle trackers,

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,660
which reconstruct the trajectory of particles, and how one uses

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,160
light detection techniques to detect particles using scintillators. 

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,010
We have already introduced the principles of particle detection by

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,930
semiconductor detectors in video 3.8, and by

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,360
scintillators in video 3.9.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
So, to my right,

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,500
you see two applications of semiconductor detectors,

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,540
on top for the ATLAS experiment of the LHC at CERN, and below

16
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,370
by the space experiment AMS installed on the International Space Station. 

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,020
Let us start by the top set-up.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,560
You see here a part of the ATLAS forward detector

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,220
and the particles enter this part of the

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,060
detector in roughly this direction. 

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,720
They are localised by these silicon

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,690
microstrip detectors, which you see on my left. 

23
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,850
There are in fact two superimposed detectors, glued to each other. 

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,010
They make a small angle, which permits, even by a detector

25
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,380
with single sided read out, to localise the particles in three dimensions. 

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,250
You see on the bottom of each detector a small electronics card,

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,260
directly connected to the detector, which shapes the signal

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,610
and, when a trigger arrives, transmits it, 

29
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,650
in this case an optical signal, through this slim optical fibre coming out. 

30
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,160
You also see this piping behind,

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,770
which is part of the detector infrastructure,

32
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,730
and which transports a cooling liquid, absorbing the heat and

33
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,490
stabilising the temperature of detector and electronics. 

34
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,530
The second line of particle detectors, 

35
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,740
which we very actively follow here at the Department of Nuclear 

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,070
and Particle Physics of the University of Geneva,
are scintillation detectors,

37
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,495
which we have already introduced in video 3.9.

38
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:04,660
So, here

39
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,160
you see the classical way of constructing a scintillation detector. 

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,250
You take a scintillating material, you connect it

41
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,840
via a light guide to a photomultiplier. 

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,880
In the past, in the 1970-80â€™s, these were

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,680
vacuum tubes, very bulky and heavy.

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,790
And here you see the direction which is being followed today. 

45
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,340
On can produce scintillating fibres, 

46
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,713
very fine ones, which can be connected to a very small

47
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:55,247
light detector like this one, 

48
00:03:55,247 --> 00:04:01,920
which allows at the same time to localise 

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,720
particles ant to measure their specific energy loss dE/dx,

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,630
as we have explained in video 3.9.

51
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,280
Once integrated, the set-up looks roughly like this,

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,410
you see a fine layer of scintillators directly coupled 

53
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,920
to a semiconductor light detector, which localises light emission

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,479
and measures its intensity, produced by the passage of the particle. 

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,960
With this one can also construct particle tracking detectors,

56
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,400
which are light, deformable and can be adjusted to

57
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,950
practically any detector shape

58
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,970
since the whole stays flexible and can be 

59
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,370
made to made to follow almost any desired form. 

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,880
With this, 

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,350
you have seen two of our specialties in the development of novel 
particle detectors. 

62
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,238
But we do not stop here. The direction we follow for

63
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:26,040
semiconductor sensors goes towards pixel detectors,

64
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,580
which allow, in the same sensor, 

65
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,070
to directly localise particles in two directions. 

66
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,860
They also present an improvement

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,530
in resolution, which is rather impressive. 

68
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,960
You see here a sensor, which localises particles to about

69
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,170
ten micrometers.

70
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,250
I remind you that the diameter of a human hair

71
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,470
is about 100 micrometers, i.e. the sensor localisation 

72
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,793
is 10 times more precise. 

73
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:13,411
