in this video, i will give you a little insight 
one uses particle detectors 
we introduced in module 
to detect charged particles light 
end this video you will know one integrates 
semiconductor sensors socalled particle trackers, 
reconstruct trajectory particles, one uses 
light detection techniques to detect particles using scintillators 
we already introduced principles particle detection 
semiconductor detectors in video , 
scintillators in video 
so, to right, 
you see two applications semiconductor detectors, 
top atlas experiment lhc cern, 
space experiment ams installed international space station 
let us start top setup 
you see here a part atlas forward detector 
particles enter this part 
detector in roughly this direction 
localised silicon 
microstrip detectors, you see left 
there in fact two superimposed detectors, glued to 
make a small angle, permits, even a detector 
single sided read out, to localise particles in three dimensions 
you see bottom detector a small electronics card, 
directly connected to detector, shapes signal 
and, a trigger arrives, transmits it, 
in this case an optical signal, this slim optical fibre coming 
you also see this piping behind, 
is part detector infrastructure, 
transports a cooling liquid, absorbing heat 
stabilising temperature detector electronics 
second line particle detectors, 
we actively follow here department nuclear 
particle physics university geneva, 
scintillation detectors, 
we already introduced in video 
so, here 
you see classical way constructing a scintillation detector 
you take a scintillating material, you connect 
via a light guide to a photomultiplier 
in past, in s, 
vacuum tubes, bulky heavy 
here you see direction is followed today 
produce scintillating fibres, 
fine ones, connected to a small 
light detector like this one, 
allows time to localise 
particles ant to measure specific energy loss dedx, 
we explained in video 
integrated, setup looks roughly like this, 
you see a fine layer scintillators directly coupled 
to a semiconductor light detector, localises light emission 
measures intensity, produced passage particle 
this one also construct particle tracking detectors, 
light, deformable adjusted to 
practically detector shape 
since whole stays flexible 
made to made to follow almost desired form 
this, 
you seen two specialties in development novel 
particle detectors 
we stop here direction we follow 
semiconductor sensors goes towards pixel detectors, 
allow, in sensor, 
to directly localise particles in two directions 
also present an improvement 
in resolution, is rather impressive 
you see here a sensor, localises particles to 
ten micrometers 
i remind you that diameter a human hair 
is micrometers, ie sensor localisation 
is times precise
