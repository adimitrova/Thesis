2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:13,861
In this module, we touch the basics
of particle exhilaration and

3
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,360
detection matters.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,520
And in this fourth video,

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,380
we will show how heavy charged
particles interact with matter.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,100
These interaction mechanisms
are used to detect them.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,160
At the end of the video, you will know
the energy loss by ionization and

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,940
excitation of heavy charged particles.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,334
And the distribution of the energy
loss for these particles and

10
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:38,740
their angular deviation when
traversing a slice of material.

11
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:45,800
To detect particles, one must make
them obviously interact with matter.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,140
With the exception of neutrinos,
all particles interact in one way or

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,770
another via the electromagnetic force.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,810
Hadrons, obviously, also interact
via the strong or the nuclear force.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,670
Electromagnetic interactions thus play
a predominant role among the mechanisms of

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,990
interaction and particle detection.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,210
Its different reactions are listed here.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,601
We will discuss them in this video and
the one that follows.

19
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:16,973
When a charged particle passes through
a slice of material of thickness dx,

20
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:20,530
it ionizes or excites the atoms it meets.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,650
By this, the particle loses
the part dE of its energy.

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,410
The energy lost per unit length,

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,100
dE/dx, plays a central role in
the detection of stable charged particles.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,458
It depends on both the properties of
the particle such as its charge z and

25
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:40,170
its velocity beta, as well as
the properties of the material crossed,

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,840
like the volume density n_e
of its electrons,

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,280
which is proportional to the atomic
charge and its ionization constant I,

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,110
which describes how easy
it is to ionize its atoms.

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,289
The dependence of dE/dx on
these factors is described by

30
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,828
the Bethe-Bloch formula reproduced
on the top of this slide.

31
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:08,317
One can combine many of the constants
into a single one which is called

32
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,500
K in this slide.

33
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,510
Thus, it can be seen that at low velocity
dE/dx is proportional to the charge

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,380
of the particle squared and

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,910
inversely proportional to
the square of its velocity.

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,230
The energy loss goes
through a shallow minimum,

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,570
located approximately at the same
velocity for all particles.

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,995
In this minimum,
particles are called minimum ionizing.

39
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:38,103
Because of the strong dependence
on the square of the charge,

40
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:43,323
we can even identify the charge of the
incident particle by measuring dE/dx.

41
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:51,399
Beyond the minimum, the energy
loss dE/dx increases slightly

42
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:57,036
with the logarithm of beta gamma equal
to p/m, as shown in this graph.

43
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,803
Here's a summary of dE/dx
in typical gases, liquids, and

44
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,300
metals as presented by
the particle data group.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,320
The minimum of the curves is
approximately at the same velocity for

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,370
all the materials.

47
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,600
It is surprising that the curves for
solids are below that for gas.

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,840
Do not forget that the energy loss
is given here with respect to 

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,598
the surface density.

50
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,920
To find dE/dx in units of penetrated
depth, one must multiply by the volume

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,760
density of the material which is a 150
times greater full lead than for hydrogen.

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,150
The beta gamma scale, the x-axis of
this graph, is converted to momentum

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,150
from neurons, charged pions and
protons to simplify the use of this graph.

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,730
Obviously, the energy
loss by ionization and

55
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,160
excitation is a random process, which
will not always yield the same result.

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,120
Therefore, dE in a given
material thickness dx

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,490
follows a Landau distribution.

58
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,810
This is an asymmetric distribution
around the most probable value E_W

59
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,070
with a width characterized by xi.

60
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,029
The most probable energy loss is
derived from the Bethe-Bloch formula.

61
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:20,752
Since dE/dx increases with decreasing
velocity, the particle loses more and

62
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:24,790
more energy per unit depth
while penetrating the material.

63
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,610
The greatest loss happens immediately
before the particle is stopped.

64
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,950
This is called the Bragg Peak.

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,675
The effect may be beneficial
in medical applications.

66
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,282
When irradiating tissue by charged
particles, one can adjust the initial

67
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:45,033
momentum and thus, the penetration such
that most of the energy is deposited

68
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:49,591
where a cancerous tumor is located,
preserving healthy tissue around.

69
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:55,434
Multiple scattering off
atomic electrons also deflect

70
00:04:55,434 --> 00:05:00,230
the incident particle from its initial
direction and displaces its path.

71
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,905
The distribution of angular deflection
follows a Gaussian around zero.

72
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:08,195
The width depends on particle and
material properties as shown.

73
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:12,075
The latter can be combined
into the radiation length, X_0,

74
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,053
which we will introduce
later in this module.

75
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:19,990
Hadrons, of course, also belong
to the class of heavy particles.

76
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,210
In addition to
electromagnetic interactions,

77
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,200
they can interact with matter nuclei
through strong or nuclear interactions.

78
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,550
Elastic scattering makes them
lose energy to a lesser extent

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,560
because nuclei are typically heavy and
recoil little.

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,510
Inelastic interactions occur at high
energies and create additional particles.

81
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,640
These deposit energy by dE/dx, but
can also, in turn, produce more particles.

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,280
At sufficient energy, typically,
a few GeV,

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,760
this will generate a cascade process
which is called a hadron shower.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,112
You see in this image a simulation
of such a process with an incoming

85
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,470
high-energy proton.

86
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,720
Each block dot represents a unit of
energy loss by a charged particle.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,370
The characteristic
lengths of this processes

88
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,510
are the nuclear collision lengths
applying to elastic interactions and

89
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,720
the nuclear interaction length
applying to inelastic interactions.

90
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,200
Both can be found in the tables
of the Particle Data Group.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,647
They are typically much larger than
the radiation length of the material.

92
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:28,781
In the next video, we talk about
the interactions of light particles in

93
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:31,548
general, and bremsstrahlung in particular.

94
