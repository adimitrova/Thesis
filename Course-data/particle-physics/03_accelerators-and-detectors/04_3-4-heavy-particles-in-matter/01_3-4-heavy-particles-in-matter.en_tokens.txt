in
this
module
,
we
touch
the
basics
of
particle
exhilaration
and
detection
matters
.
and
in
this
fourth
video
,
we
will
show
how
heavy
charged
particles
interact
with
matter
.
these
interaction
mechanisms
are
used
to
detect
them
.
at
the
end
of
the
video
,
you
will
know
the
energy
loss
by
ionization
and
excitation
of
heavy
charged
particles
.
and
the
distribution
of
the
energy
loss
for
these
particles
and
their
angular
deviation
when
traversing
a
slice
of
material
.
to
detect
particles
,
one
must
make
them
obviously
interact
with
matter
.
with
the
exception
of
neutrinos
,
all
particles
interact
in
one
way
or
another
via
the
electromagnetic
force
.
hadrons
,
obviously
,
also
interact
via
the
strong
or
the
nuclear
force
.
electromagnetic
interactions
thus
play
a
predominant
role
among
the
mechanisms
of
interaction
and
particle
detection
.
its
different
reactions
are
listed
here
.
we
will
discuss
them
in
this
video
and
the
one
that
follows
.
when
a
charged
particle
passes
through
a
slice
of
material
of
thickness
dx
,
it
ionizes
or
excites
the
atoms
it
meets
.
by
this
,
the
particle
loses
the
part
de
of
its
energy
.
the
energy
lost
per
unit
length
,
de/dx
,
plays
a
central
role
in
the
detection
of
stable
charged
particles
.
it
depends
on
both
the
properties
of
the
particle
such
as
its
charge
z
and
its
velocity
beta
,
as
well
as
the
properties
of
the
material
crossed
,
like
the
volume
density
n_e
of
its
electrons
,
which
is
proportional
to
the
atomic
charge
and
its
ionization
constant
i
,
which
describes
how
easy
it
is
to
ionize
its
atoms
.
the
dependence
of
de/dx
on
these
factors
is
described
by
the
bethe-bloch
formula
reproduced
on
the
top
of
this
slide
.
one
can
combine
many
of
the
constants
into
a
single
one
which
is
called
k
in
this
slide
.
thus
,
it
can
be
seen
that
at
low
velocity
de/dx
is
proportional
to
the
charge
of
the
particle
squared
and
inversely
proportional
to
the
square
of
its
velocity
.
the
energy
loss
goes
through
a
shallow
minimum
,
located
approximately
at
the
same
velocity
for
all
particles
.
in
this
minimum
,
particles
are
called
minimum
ionizing
.
because
of
the
strong
dependence
on
the
square
of
the
charge
,
we
can
even
identify
the
charge
of
the
incident
particle
by
measuring
de/dx
.
beyond
the
minimum
,
the
energy
loss
de/dx
increases
slightly
with
the
logarithm
of
beta
gamma
equal
to
p/m
,
as
shown
in
this
graph
.
here
's
a
summary
of
de/dx
in
typical
gases
,
liquids
,
and
metals
as
presented
by
the
particle
data
group
.
the
minimum
of
the
curves
is
approximately
at
the
same
velocity
for
all
the
materials
.
it
is
surprising
that
the
curves
for
solids
are
below
that
for
gas
.
do
not
forget
that
the
energy
loss
is
given
here
with
respect
to
the
surface
density
.
to
find
de/dx
in
units
of
penetrated
depth
,
one
must
multiply
by
the
volume
density
of
the
material
which
is
a
150
times
greater
full
lead
than
for
hydrogen
.
the
beta
gamma
scale
,
the
x-axis
of
this
graph
,
is
converted
to
momentum
from
neurons
,
charged
pions
and
protons
to
simplify
the
use
of
this
graph
.
obviously
,
the
energy
loss
by
ionization
and
excitation
is
a
random
process
,
which
will
not
always
yield
the
same
result
.
therefore
,
de
in
a
given
material
thickness
dx
follows
a
landau
distribution
.
this
is
an
asymmetric
distribution
around
the
most
probable
value
e_w
with
a
width
characterized
by
xi
.
the
most
probable
energy
loss
is
derived
from
the
bethe-bloch
formula
.
since
de/dx
increases
with
decreasing
velocity
,
the
particle
loses
more
and
more
energy
per
unit
depth
while
penetrating
the
material
.
the
greatest
loss
happens
immediately
before
the
particle
is
stopped
.
this
is
called
the
bragg
peak
.
the
effect
may
be
beneficial
in
medical
applications
.
when
irradiating
tissue
by
charged
particles
,
one
can
adjust
the
initial
momentum
and
thus
,
the
penetration
such
that
most
of
the
energy
is
deposited
where
a
cancerous
tumor
is
located
,
preserving
healthy
tissue
around
.
multiple
scattering
off
atomic
electrons
also
deflect
the
incident
particle
from
its
initial
direction
and
displaces
its
path
.
the
distribution
of
angular
deflection
follows
a
gaussian
around
zero
.
the
width
depends
on
particle
and
material
properties
as
shown
.
the
latter
can
be
combined
into
the
radiation
length
,
x_0
,
which
we
will
introduce
later
in
this
module
.
hadrons
,
of
course
,
also
belong
to
the
class
of
heavy
particles
.
in
addition
to
electromagnetic
interactions
,
they
can
interact
with
matter
nuclei
through
strong
or
nuclear
interactions
.
elastic
scattering
makes
them
lose
energy
to
a
lesser
extent
because
nuclei
are
typically
heavy
and
recoil
little
.
inelastic
interactions
occur
at
high
energies
and
create
additional
particles
.
these
deposit
energy
by
de/dx
,
but
can
also
,
in
turn
,
produce
more
particles
.
at
sufficient
energy
,
typically
,
a
few
gev
,
this
will
generate
a
cascade
process
which
is
called
a
hadron
shower
.
you
see
in
this
image
a
simulation
of
such
a
process
with
an
incoming
high-energy
proton
.
each
block
dot
represents
a
unit
of
energy
loss
by
a
charged
particle
.
the
characteristic
lengths
of
this
processes
are
the
nuclear
collision
lengths
applying
to
elastic
interactions
and
the
nuclear
interaction
length
applying
to
inelastic
interactions
.
both
can
be
found
in
the
tables
of
the
particle
data
group
.
they
are
typically
much
larger
than
the
radiation
length
of
the
material
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
talk
about
the
interactions
of
light
particles
in
general
,
and
bremsstrahlung
in
particular
.
