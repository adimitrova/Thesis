in this module, we touch basics 
particle exhilaration 
detection matters 
in this fourth video, 
we will show heavy charged 
particles interact matter 
interaction mechanisms 
used to detect 
end video, you will know 
energy loss ionization 
excitation heavy charged particles 
distribution energy 
loss particles 
angular deviation 
traversing a slice material 
to detect particles, one must make 
obviously interact matter 
exception neutrinos, 
particles interact in one way 
another via electromagnetic force 
hadrons, obviously, also interact 
via strong nuclear force 
electromagnetic interactions thus play 
a predominant role among mechanisms 
interaction particle detection 
different reactions listed here 
we will discuss in this video 
one that follows 
a charged particle passes 
a slice material thickness dx, 
ionizes excites atoms meets 
this, particle loses 
part de energy 
energy lost per unit length, 
dedx, plays a central role in 
detection stable charged particles 
depends properties 
particle charge z 
velocity beta, well 
properties material crossed, 
like volume density ne 
electrons, 
is proportional to atomic 
charge ionization constant i, 
describes easy 
is to ionize atoms 
dependence dedx 
factors is described 
bethebloch formula reproduced 
top this slide 
one combine many constants 
a single one is called 
k in this slide 
thus, seen that low velocity 
dedx is proportional to charge 
particle squared 
inversely proportional to 
square velocity 
energy loss goes 
a shallow minimum, 
located approximately 
velocity particles 
in this minimum, 
particles called minimum ionizing 
strong dependence 
square charge, 
we even identify charge 
incident particle measuring dedx 
beyond minimum, energy 
loss dedx increases slightly 
logarithm beta gamma equal 
to pm, shown in this graph 
heres a summary dedx 
in typical gases, liquids, 
metals presented 
particle data group 
minimum curves is 
approximately velocity 
materials 
is surprising that curves 
solids that gas 
forget that energy loss 
is given here respect to 
surface density 
to find dedx in units penetrated 
depth, one must multiply volume 
density material is a 
times greater full lead hydrogen 
beta gamma scale, xaxis 
this graph, is converted to momentum 
neurons, charged pions 
protons to simplify use this graph 
obviously, energy 
loss ionization 
excitation is a random process, 
will always yield result 
therefore, de in a given 
material thickness dx 
follows a landau distribution 
this is an asymmetric distribution 
around probable value ew 
a width characterized xi 
probable energy loss is 
derived bethebloch formula 
since dedx increases decreasing 
velocity, particle loses 
energy per unit depth 
while penetrating material 
greatest loss happens immediately 
particle is stopped 
this is called bragg peak 
effect may beneficial 
in medical applications 
irradiating tissue charged 
particles, one adjust initial 
momentum thus, penetration 
that energy is deposited 
a cancerous tumor is located, 
preserving healthy tissue around 
multiple scattering 
atomic electrons also deflect 
incident particle initial 
direction displaces path 
distribution angular deflection 
follows a gaussian around zero 
width depends particle 
material properties shown 
latter combined 
radiation length, x, 
we will introduce 
later in this module 
hadrons, course, also belong 
to class heavy particles 
in addition to 
electromagnetic interactions, 
interact matter nuclei 
strong nuclear interactions 
elastic scattering makes 
lose energy to a lesser extent 
nuclei typically heavy 
recoil little 
inelastic interactions occur high 
energies create additional particles 
deposit energy dedx, 
also, in turn, produce particles 
sufficient energy, typically, 
a few gev, 
this will generate a cascade process 
is called a hadron shower 
you see in this image a simulation
