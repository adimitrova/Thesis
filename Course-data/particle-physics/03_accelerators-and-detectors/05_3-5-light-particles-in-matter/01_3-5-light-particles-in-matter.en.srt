2
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:14,598
In this module, we are touching
the basics of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,870
detection techniques.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,940
In this video, we show how light
charged particles interacts with matter.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,280
These interactions are used
to detect these particles.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,100
At the end of this video, you will
know the energy loss by ionization and

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,520
excitation for electrons.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,310
And the energy loss by radiation,
specific to light particles.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,343
For light particles like electrons and
positrons,

10
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,640
things get slightly complicated.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,425
The formula for dE/dx is similar 
to that for heavy particles.

12
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:55,284
But the special properties of scattering
between electrons, the MÃ¸ller

13
00:00:55,284 --> 00:01:00,784
scattering, and between electrons and
positrons, Bhabha scattering, come in.

14
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:04,702
The difference between dE/dx for electrons and

15
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:07,695
positrons is however not very large.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,490
But there is an important difference
between light and heavy particles.

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,670
Since light projectiles and
atomic electrons are of comparable mass,

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,120
interaction with atomic
electrons causes bremsstrahlung.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,390
The energy loss, dE/dx

20
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,680
by this process, is proportional
to the energy of the projectile.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,654
The material properties that
come into play can be combined

22
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:42,038
into a single constant,
the radiation length X_0.

23
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,323
By integrating the energy loss,

24
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:49,370
we can calculate the remaining energy,
E(x) of the electron.

25
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,650
It is a function which
decreases exponentially

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,130
with the penetrated material depth x.

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,750
The radiation length is then given as
the path length after which the energy

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,960
of the projectile is
reduced by a factor of e.

29
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,995
To obtain the energy loss, dE/dx, or

30
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,675
the radiation length in terms of
the target surface density,

31
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,549
one must take into action the volume
density of rho of the material.

32
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:26,191
Many material properties are tabulated
by the Particle Data Group,

33
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:31,159
particularly the volume density and
the radiation length,

34
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,506
that you can find on the web page
quoted here at the bottom of the page.

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,636
A property specific to positrons
is that they can annihilate with

36
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:46,200
atomic electrons of the material.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,131
This process is important at low
energy that is at the end of the path

38
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:54,430
just before the positron stops.

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,380
From annihilation at rest, two photons
are emitted back to back, each with

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,400
an energy equal to the mass of the
electron, which is 511 keV.

41
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,510
At energy above about 10 MeV,
electrons and

42
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,307
positrons lose energy
mainly by bremsstrahlung,

43
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:20,117
which dominates over ionization and
excitation.

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:25,117
This means that many photons are produced
when high energy electrons go through

45
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,440
matter.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,750
Those are mostly converted
into electron-positron pairs,

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,560
as discussed in the next video.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,406
And these pairs will emit photons in turn.

49
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:44,215
In this way, high energy electrons
generate electron photon showers in

50
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:48,520
matter, which are populated by
a large number of particles.

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,191
The strong interaction of hadrons with
the nuclei of the material can also

52
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,410
cause showers called hadronic showers.

53
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,242
These are typically less populated
at comparable energies because

54
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:06,177
the lightest hadron, the pion,
has a mass of about 100 MeV.

55
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:11,640
For the same reason, they are wider and
less regular than electromagnetic showers.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,034
Again, the table provided
by the Particle Data Group

57
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:22,550
summarizes the properties or materials
often used in particle detectors.

58
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,497
The characteristic lengths for

59
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:29,256
nuclear interaction are typically
comparable to the radiation length for

60
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:32,730
lighter materials but
much higher for heavy materials.

61
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:41,871
In the next video, we will discuss in more
detail how photons interact with matter.
