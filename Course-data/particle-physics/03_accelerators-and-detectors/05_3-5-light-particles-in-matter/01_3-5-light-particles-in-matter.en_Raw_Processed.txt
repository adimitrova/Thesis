music 
in this module, we touching 
basics particle acceleration 
detection techniques 
in this video, we show light 
charged particles interacts matter 
interactions used 
to detect particles 
end this video, you will 
know energy loss ionization 
excitation electrons 
energy loss radiation, 
specific to light particles 
light particles like electrons 
positrons, 
things get slightly complicated 
formula dedx is similar 
to that heavy particles 
special properties scattering 
between electrons, mller 
scattering, between electrons 
positrons, bhabha scattering, come in 
difference between dedx electrons 
positrons is however large 
there is an important difference 
between light heavy particles 
since light projectiles 
atomic electrons comparable mass, 
interaction atomic 
electrons causes bremsstrahlung 
energy loss, dedx 
this process, is proportional 
to energy projectile 
material properties that 
come play combined 
a single constant, 
radiation length x 
integrating energy loss, 
we calculate remaining energy, 
ex electron 
is a function 
decreases exponentially 
penetrated material depth x 
radiation length is given 
path length energy 
projectile is 
reduced a factor e 
to obtain energy loss, dedx, 
radiation length in terms 
target surface density, 
one must take action volume 
density rho material 
many material properties tabulated 
particle data group, 
particularly volume density 
radiation length, 
that you find web page 
quoted here bottom page 
a property specific to positrons 
is that annihilate 
atomic electrons material 
this process is important low 
energy that is end path 
positron stops 
annihilation rest, two photons 
emitted back to back, 
an energy equal to mass 
electron, is kev 
energy mev, 
electrons 
positrons lose energy 
mainly bremsstrahlung, 
dominates ionization 
excitation 
this means that many photons produced 
high energy electrons go 
matter 
mostly converted 
electronpositron pairs, 
discussed in next video 
pairs will emit photons in turn 
in this way, high energy electrons 
generate electron photon showers in 
matter, populated 
a large number particles 
strong interaction hadrons 
nuclei material also 
cause showers called hadronic showers 
typically less populated 
comparable energies 
lightest hadron, pion, 
a mass mev 
reason, wider 
less regular electromagnetic showers 
again, table provided 
particle data group 
summarizes properties materials 
often used in particle detectors 
characteristic lengths 
nuclear interaction typically 
comparable to radiation length 
lighter materials 
much higher heavy materials 
in next video, we will discuss in 
detail photons interact matter
