in
this
module
,
we
are
touching
the
basics
of
particle
acceleration
and
detection
techniques
.
in
this
video
,
we
show
how
light
charged
particles
interacts
with
matter
.
these
interactions
are
used
to
detect
these
particles
.
at
the
end
of
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
energy
loss
by
ionization
and
excitation
for
electrons
.
and
the
energy
loss
by
radiation
,
specific
to
light
particles
.
for
light
particles
like
electrons
and
positrons
,
things
get
slightly
complicated
.
the
formula
for
de/dx
is
similar
to
that
for
heavy
particles
.
but
the
special
properties
of
scattering
between
electrons
,
the
mÃ£Â¸ller
scattering
,
and
between
electrons
and
positrons
,
bhabha
scattering
,
come
in
.
the
difference
between
de/dx
for
electrons
and
positrons
is
however
not
very
large
.
but
there
is
an
important
difference
between
light
and
heavy
particles
.
since
light
projectiles
and
atomic
electrons
are
of
comparable
mass
,
interaction
with
atomic
electrons
causes
bremsstrahlung
.
the
energy
loss
,
de/dx
by
this
process
,
is
proportional
to
the
energy
of
the
projectile
.
the
material
properties
that
come
into
play
can
be
combined
into
a
single
constant
,
the
radiation
length
x_0
.
by
integrating
the
energy
loss
,
we
can
calculate
the
remaining
energy
,
e
(
x
)
of
the
electron
.
it
is
a
function
which
decreases
exponentially
with
the
penetrated
material
depth
x.
the
radiation
length
is
then
given
as
the
path
length
after
which
the
energy
of
the
projectile
is
reduced
by
a
factor
of
e.
to
obtain
the
energy
loss
,
de/dx
,
or
the
radiation
length
in
terms
of
the
target
surface
density
,
one
must
take
into
action
the
volume
density
of
rho
of
the
material
.
many
material
properties
are
tabulated
by
the
particle
data
group
,
particularly
the
volume
density
and
the
radiation
length
,
that
you
can
find
on
the
web
page
quoted
here
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
.
a
property
specific
to
positrons
is
that
they
can
annihilate
with
atomic
electrons
of
the
material
.
this
process
is
important
at
low
energy
that
is
at
the
end
of
the
path
just
before
the
positron
stops
.
from
annihilation
at
rest
,
two
photons
are
emitted
back
to
back
,
each
with
an
energy
equal
to
the
mass
of
the
electron
,
which
is
511
kev
.
at
energy
above
about
10
mev
,
electrons
and
positrons
lose
energy
mainly
by
bremsstrahlung
,
which
dominates
over
ionization
and
excitation
.
this
means
that
many
photons
are
produced
when
high
energy
electrons
go
through
matter
.
those
are
mostly
converted
into
electron-positron
pairs
,
as
discussed
in
the
next
video
.
and
these
pairs
will
emit
photons
in
turn
.
in
this
way
,
high
energy
electrons
generate
electron
photon
showers
in
matter
,
which
are
populated
by
a
large
number
of
particles
.
the
strong
interaction
of
hadrons
with
the
nuclei
of
the
material
can
also
cause
showers
called
hadronic
showers
.
these
are
typically
less
populated
at
comparable
energies
because
the
lightest
hadron
,
the
pion
,
has
a
mass
of
about
100
mev
.
for
the
same
reason
,
they
are
wider
and
less
regular
than
electromagnetic
showers
.
again
,
the
table
provided
by
the
particle
data
group
summarizes
the
properties
or
materials
often
used
in
particle
detectors
.
the
characteristic
lengths
for
nuclear
interaction
are
typically
comparable
to
the
radiation
length
for
lighter
materials
but
much
higher
for
heavy
materials
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
discuss
in
more
detail
how
photons
interact
with
matter
.
