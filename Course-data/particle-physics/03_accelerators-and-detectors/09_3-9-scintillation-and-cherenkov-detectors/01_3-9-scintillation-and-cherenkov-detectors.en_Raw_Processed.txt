in this module, we touching 
basics particle acceleration 
detection metals 
in this video, well continue 
discussion particle detection, 
techniques, talking 
scintillators cherenkov detectors 
watching this video, you will know 
principle particle detection 
scintillation light, measurements 
that done via cherenkov effect 
in scintillation detectors, 
also called simply scintillators, 
particles detected means 
luminescence mechanism 
certain materials, 
exposed to radiation, absorb energy, 
is emitted light 
if light emission occurs soon 
radiation, we call fluorescence 
if takes milliseconds to 
emit light, we call phosphorescence 
scintillation corresponds to fluorescence, 
radiation charged particles, 
high energy photons neutrons 
there two types scintillating 
materials, inorganic materials, 
fluorescence is associated to 
intermediate states due to impurities 
a high atomic number, so 
wellsuited photon detection 
ceramics, 
glasses, liquids, noble gases 
crystals, 
thalliumdoped sodium iodide, 
lead tungstate bismuth germanate, 
also called bgo 
this is an example 
a bismuth germanate, 
a bgo crystal, is quite heavy 
organic materials second 
type scintillating materials 
in these, source fluorescence 
excited molecular states 
high hydrogen content, so 
well suited neutron detection 
crystals, liquids 
doped plastics like this example here 
a short response times, 
ranging nanoseconds 
organic scintillators towards 
nanoseconds inorganic ones 
a particle traversing a scintillator 
excites atoms molecules 
material, will return 
to ground state emitting photons 
if material is transparent 
least a portion scintillation 
wavelength spectrum, photons 
emitted collected end 
scintillator a photosensitive 
detector, example, 
in photomultiplier tube, pmt, 
often to a light guide 
collected light is 
transformed an electrical signal 
shape signal, 
is shown in plot bottom, 
is characterized short rise 
time, typically less one nanosecond, 
much larger decay time 
order nanoseconds 
this short rise time makes scintillator 
response faster ionization detectors 
thats used 
in triggering systems 
a good efficiency, energy 
needed to create a scintillation photon 
ranges electronvolt 
thalliumdoped sodium iodide, 
to a few hundred electron volts 
doped plastic bgo 
except low energies, 
linear, that is, 
number photons is proportional 
to energy deposition 
thus, counting photons allows to 
measure deposited energy d dx 
often, light guides used to transport 
scintillation light to photodetector, 
minimizing losses absorption 
leakage 
used to adapt shape 
scintillator cross section 
to that photodetector 
here is an example a light guide, 
so 
typically scintillators 
will connected here 
light will routed 
to photodetector, 
will connected 
here bottom 
in cases, light guides also 
serve to shift emission 
spectrum scintillation light 
to better match spectral 
sensitivity photodetector 
is called a wavelength shifter 
materials 
absorb scintillation light 
remit in a different wavelength 
in order to minimize light 
losses reflection, 
light guides well scintillators 
use total internal reflection 
if incident angle theta photon 
is larger a critical angle, 
theta c, sine theta c is equal 
to ratio between reflecting 
index in air 
in scintillator light guides, 
photon will escape reflection 
will reach photodetector 
plastic, 
critical angle is degrees 
smaller angles, mirror reflection a 
external reflector like reflective paint, 
paper 
special foils like liquidity used 
reflection 
reduced using luo gel, 
reflective 
index to join elements 
here is an example 
scintillator bars, 
painted white 
paint to minimize reflection 
also connected to 
wavelength shifter fibers, 
guide light 
to photodetector, 
will connected here top 
wavelength spectrum photons 
emitted scintillation an error 
distribution around a maximum 
plastic, 
maximum is nanometers 
thalliumdoped sodium 
iodide nanometers 
nanometers bgo, 
nanometers 
cadmium tungstate, shown in this graph 
also shown is detection efficiency 
a specific photodetector, 
a photomultiplier 
this quantity is often called 
quantum efficiency 
is optimum in a certain spectral range, 
so 
photomultiplier must 
adapted to material used 
sometimes a dopant is added to 
detection material to shift 
wavelength better fit 
photomultiplier sensitivity 
dopant absorbs scintillation 
photons quickly, 
that is in less one nanosecond, 
emits photons another wavelength 
photon must pass scintillator 
to reach photosensitive elements 
photons will absorbed way 
number nonabsorbed photons 
decreases distance following 
an exponential distribution, depends 
attenuation length material, 
is generally 
order one meter 
this allows to build large 
scintillation detectors 
purpose photodetector is 
to convert scintillation photons 
to an electrical signal, 
processed 
electronically amplification 
here we show a photomultiplier, 
conversion photons 
an electrical signal is achieved 
via photoelectric effect 
in a thin layer alkali metal 
alloy called photocathode 
quantum efficiency measures number 
photoelectrons created 
per incident photon 
modern photocathodes, 
this is typically , , 
depending wavelength, shown in 
this plot two different photocathodes 
behind photocathode is 
a series electrodes, 
typically to , called dynodes 
contain a particular alloy 
low ionization energy 
an increasing electrical 
potential is applied 
photoelectrons emitted 
photocathode accelerated 
focalized first dynode 
release, typically between two 
five electrons per photoelectron, 
depending applied voltage 
signal amplification progresses 
line to dynode, 
total gain reach 
million dynodes 
here is an example 
a photo tube metal dynodes 
another type photodetector 
implements dynodes 
grades like in this example 
a metal mesh photo tube, 
you see is much compact 
photo tube metal dynodes 
so lets see cherenkov 
effect an used to detect particles 
a charged particles velocity 
v going a medium 
refractive index n will 
polarize atom along path 
atoms become electric dipoles 
emit electromagnetic radiation upon 
returning to ground state 
if velocity particle 
exceed that light in medium, 
radiation dipoles upstream 
downstream sides to cancel 
if contrary, velocity 
particle v is larger c n, 
c is velocity light 
in a vacuum n is reflective 
index medium, downstream 
material cannot polarized 
electromagnetic field created 
particle propagates less 
quickly particle 
net radiation results 
waveform to form cone light, 
around part particle 
this is cherenkov effect 
this kind radiation is produced 
in transparent media 
energy loss cherenkov 
radiation is negligible 
there mechanical analogies 
to this mechanism, is like 
a boat in water a plane 
exceeds velocity mach one 
additional threshold 
is a bit larger 
inverse refractive 
index medium 
a threshold radiation is emitted 
in direction particle that 
is theta equal to 
different threshold charged 
particles different masses 
spread to differences between 
reason to identify different isotopes 
particles heavier m max 
will emit radiation 
ring imaging cherenkov, 
go reach, go a step 
here cherenkov light is 
intercepted a detection surface 
photons form a ring, allows to 
measure cherenkov light angle, 
thus determine velocity 
incoming particle 
in addition, intensity 
cherenkov light, that is number 
photons in circle, is proportional 
to square particle charge 
cherenkov light is also emitted in water 
this gives possibility 
build a large mass detector like 
superkamiokande in japan 
this gigantic water tank, 
surrounded photomultipliers, 
is used to detect neutrinos 
in next video, we will see 
different detectors combined to 
form spectrometers calorimeters
