2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:14,168
In this module, we are touching
the basics of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:15,175
detection metals.

4
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:20,389
And in this video, we'll continue our
discussion of particle detection,

5
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:26,320
the techniques, talking about
scintillators and Cherenkov detectors.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,766
After watching this video, you will know
the principle of particle detection by

7
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:37,710
scintillation light, and the measurements
that can be done via the Cherenkov effect.

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,383
In scintillation detectors,
also called more simply scintillators,

9
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:49,570
particles are detected by means
of their luminescence mechanism.

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,310
Certain materials,
when exposed to radiation, absorb energy,

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,991
which is then emitted as light.

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,970
If the light emission occurs soon after
radiation, we call it fluorescence.

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,110
If it takes more than 100 milliseconds to
emit light, we call it phosphorescence.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,942
Scintillation corresponds to fluorescence,

15
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:18,060
after radiation by charged particles,
high energy photons or neutrons.

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,264
There are two types of scintillating
materials, inorganic materials, for

17
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:28,556
which fluorescence is associated to
intermediate states due to impurities.

18
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:33,160
They have a high atomic number, so
they are well-suited for photon detection.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,470
And they can be ceramics,
glasses, liquids, noble gases and

20
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,808
crystals, such as
thallium-doped sodium iodide,

21
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:47,940
lead tungstate or bismuth germanate,
also called the BGO.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,291
And this is an example
of a bismuth germanate,

23
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,870
a BGO crystal, which is quite heavy.

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,900
Organic materials are the second
type of scintillating materials.

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,858
And in these, the source of fluorescence
are excited molecular states.

26
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:14,600
They have high hydrogen content, so they
are well suited for neutron detection.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,102
They can be crystals, liquids and
doped plastics like this example here.

28
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:31,388
Both have a very short response times,
ranging from nanoseconds for

29
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:37,330
organic scintillators towards 0500
nanoseconds for inorganic ones.

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,416
A particle traversing a scintillator
excites the atoms of the molecules of

31
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:48,680
the material, which will then return
to their ground state emitting photons.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,962
If the material is transparent through
at least a portion of the scintillation

33
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,640
wavelength spectrum, the photons
emitted can be collected at the end of

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,970
the scintillator by a photosensitive
detector, for example,

35
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,430
in photomultiplier tube, PMT,
and often to a light guide.

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,520
The collected light is then
transformed into an electrical signal.

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,305
The shape of the signal,
which is shown in the plot on the bottom,

38
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:23,680
is characterized by the very short rise
time, typically less than one nanosecond,

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,418
and then much larger decay time
of the order of 100 nanoseconds.

40
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:35,490
This short rise time makes scintillator
response faster than ionization detectors.

41
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,160
That's why they are used
in triggering systems.

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,930
They have a good efficiency, the energy
needed to create a scintillation photon

43
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,120
ranges from 20 electronvolt for
thallium-doped sodium iodide,

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,040
to a few hundred electron volts for
doped plastic and BGO.

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,260
Except for low energies,
they are linear, that is,

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,260
the number of photons is proportional
to the energy deposition.

47
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,843
Thus, counting photons allows to
measure the deposited energy d by dx.

48
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:15,264
Often, light guides are used to transport
scintillation light to the photodetector,

49
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:19,250
minimizing losses both by absorption and
leakage.

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,780
They are used to adapt the shape
of the scintillator cross section

51
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,900
to that of the photodetector.

52
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,205
And here is an example of a light guide,
so

53
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:33,644
typically the scintillators
will be connected here and

54
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:37,422
the light will be routed
to the photodetector,

55
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:40,931
which will be connected
here at the bottom.

56
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:46,061
In some cases, light guides also
serve to shift the emission

57
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:51,294
spectrum of scintillation light
to better match the spectral

58
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:58,260
sensitivity of the photodetector with
what is called a wavelength shifter.

59
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,940
These are materials which
absorb scintillation light and

60
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,150
remit it in a different wavelength.

61
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,788
In order to minimize light
losses by reflection,

62
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:14,863
light guides as well as scintillators
themselves use total internal reflection.

63
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:20,569
If the incident angle theta of the photon
is larger than a critical angle,

64
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:26,274
theta c, which sine of theta c is equal
to the ratio between the reflecting

65
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:30,875
index in air and
in the scintillator over the light guides,

66
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:37,720
the photon will not escape by reflection
and will reach the photodetector.

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,434
For plastic,
the critical angle is about 39 degrees.

68
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:50,007
At smaller angles, mirror reflection on a
external reflector like reflective paint,

69
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:55,060
paper or
special foils like liquidity are used.

70
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,994
Reflection can be further
reduced using luo gel,

71
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:03,850
with the same reflective
index to join the elements.

72
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,033
And here is an example
of scintillator bars,

73
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:13,770
which have painted with white
paint to minimize reflection.

74
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,766
And then also connected to
wavelength shifter fibers,

75
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:22,807
which guide the light
to the photodetector,

76
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:26,434
which will be connected here at the top.

77
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:35,662
The wavelength spectrum of photons
emitted by scintillation has an error of

78
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,000
distribution around a maximum.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,579
For plastic,
the maximum is at 423 nanometers.

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,615
For thallium-doped sodium
iodide at 430 nanometers.

81
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:53,623
At 480 nanometers for BGO,
and 475 nanometers for

82
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:57,860
cadmium tungstate, as shown in this graph.

83
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,580
Also shown is the detection efficiency for

84
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,060
a specific photodetector,
a photomultiplier.

85
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,010
This quantity is often called
the quantum efficiency.

86
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,040
It is optimum in a certain spectral range,
so

87
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,040
the photomultiplier must be
adapted to the material used.

88
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,632
Sometimes a dopant is added to
the detection material to shift

89
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:25,590
the wavelength and better fit
the photomultiplier sensitivity.

90
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,425
The dopant absorbs the scintillation
of photons and quickly,

91
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:34,210
that is in less than one nanosecond,
emits photons with another wavelength.

92
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,350
Photon must pass through the scintillator
to reach the photosensitive elements.

93
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,430
Some photons will be absorbed on the way.

94
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,310
The number of non-absorbed photons
decreases with distance following

95
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,890
an exponential distribution, which depends
on the attenuation length of the material,

96
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,370
which is generally of
the order of one meter.

97
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,134
And this allows to build large
scintillation detectors.

98
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:07,493
The purpose of the photodetector is
to convert scintillation photons

99
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,242
to an electrical signal,

100
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:13,780
which can be then processed
electronically after amplification.

101
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,450
Here we show a photomultiplier,
where the conversion of photons into

102
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,920
an electrical signal is achieved
via the photoelectric effect

103
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,889
in a thin layer of alkali metal
alloy called photocathode.

104
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,598
The quantum efficiency measures the number

105
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,686
of photoelectrons created
per incident photon.

106
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:39,660
For modern photocathodes,
this is typically 30, 40%,

107
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,780
depending on the wavelength, as shown in
this plot for two different photocathodes.

108
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,320
Behind the photocathode is
a series of electrodes,

109
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,030
typically 10 to 14, called dynodes.

110
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,440
They contain a particular alloy
with low ionization energy.

111
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,142
An increasing electrical
potential is applied.

112
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,650
The photoelectrons emitted by
the photocathode are accelerated and

113
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,560
focalized on the first dynode.

114
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,570
They release, typically between two and

115
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,160
five electrons per photoelectron,
depending on the applied voltage.

116
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,220
The signal amplification progresses
from line to dynode, and

117
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,700
the total gain can reach 10
million after 14 dynodes.

118
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,410
And here is an example of

119
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:39,450
a photo tube with metal dynodes.

120
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,796
Another type of photodetector
implements dynodes

121
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:50,760
as grades like in this example
of a metal mesh photo tube,

122
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,484
which you see is much more compact then
the photo tube with metal dynodes.

123
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:08,927
So let's now see how the Cherenkov
effect an be used to detect particles.

124
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:13,025
A charged particles of velocity
v going through a medium

125
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:18,030
of refractive index n will
polarize the atom along its path.

126
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,812
These atoms become electric dipoles and

127
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:25,660
emit electromagnetic radiation upon
returning to the ground state.

128
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,631
If the velocity of the particle does
not exceed that of light in the medium,

129
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:37,040
radiation of the dipoles of the upstream
and downstream sides are about to cancel.

130
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,475
If on the contrary, the velocity of
the particle v is larger than c over n,

131
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,473
where c is the velocity of the light
in a vacuum and n is the reflective

132
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:53,370
index of the medium, the downstream
material cannot be polarized.

133
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,237
The electromagnetic field created
by the particle propagates less

134
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:03,018
quickly than the particle itself and
the net radiation results its

135
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:08,550
waveform to form the cone of light,
around the part or the particle.

136
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,080
This is the Cherenkov effect.

137
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,940
This kind of radiation is produced
in all transparent media.

138
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,450
The energy loss by Cherenkov
radiation is negligible.

139
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,520
There are mechanical analogies
to this mechanism, which is like

140
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,400
a boat in the water or a plane which
exceeds the velocity of mach one.

141
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,810
The additional threshold
is then a bit larger than

142
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,915
the inverse of the refractive
index of the medium.

143
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:41,822
A threshold of radiation is emitted
in the direction of the particle that

144
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,444
is at theta equal to 0.

145
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:48,277
The different threshold for charged
particles with different masses can be

146
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:53,422
spread to differences between them for
reason to identify different isotopes.

147
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:58,076
Particles heavier than m max
will not emit radiation.

148
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:04,380
Ring imaging Cherenkov,
go the reach, go a step further.

149
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,680
Here the Cherenkov light is
intercepted by a detection surface.

150
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,500
Photons form a ring, which allows to
measure Cherenkov light angle, and

151
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,850
thus determine the velocity
of the incoming particle.

152
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,420
In addition, the intensity of
the Cherenkov light, that is the number of

153
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,680
photons in the circle, is proportional
to the square of the particle charge.

154
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,460
Cherenkov light is also emitted in water.

155
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,250
This gives the possibility of
build a large mass detector like

156
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,940
the Super-Kamiokande in Japan.

157
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,449
This gigantic water tank,
surrounded by photomultipliers,

158
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,580
is used to detect neutrinos.

159
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,375
In the next video, we will see how
the different detectors are combined to

160
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,968
form spectrometers and calorimeters.

161
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:57,259
