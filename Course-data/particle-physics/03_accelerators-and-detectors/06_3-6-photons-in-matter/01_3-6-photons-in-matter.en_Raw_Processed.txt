in this module we in process discussing 
basics particle acceleration 
particle detection 
in this video, we will demonstrate 
photons interact matter 
end this video, you will know 
mechanisms detected, 
namely, photoelectric effect, 
compton scattering pair production 
in processes, photon is either 
absorbed scattered a wide angle 
photons in a beam 
keep original energy, 
flux is diminished 
a photon beam will thus 
attenuated rather lose energy 
probability an interaction in 
a given target thickness is a constant, 
proportional to cross 
section process 
this leads to an exponential decrease 
intensity a photon beam 
a function absorber thickness 
weve already calculated an example 
this in optional video a 
photons detected interactions 
produce charged particles 
photoelectric effect is absorption 
a photon an atomic electron, dominant 
between ionization energy an atom 
kv photon energy 
compton scattering is elastic 
scattering a photon a quasifree 
atomic electron, dominant around photon 
energies roughly mev 
pair production is conversion 
a photon an electronpositron pair 
in electromagnetic field 
typically a nucleus, dominant 
photon energies much larger 
mev 
we will discuss processes 
one one in follows 
in photoelectric process, 
atomic electron is released 
atom absorbs photon 
kinetic energy is difference 
between photon energy 
ionization energy 
this latter one depends shell 
electron 
is typically between 
electron volts 
photoelectric process is 
feasible a free electron 
would violate conservation momentum 
if photon energy 
is larger k shell energy, 
cross section is dominated 
level roughly 
absorption k shell electrons, 
since proximity nucleus 
eases absorption recoil energy 
sigmath, in this formula, is standard 
crosssection thompson scattering, 
sets scale this cross section 
dependence atomic 
charge to fifth power 
photon energy to 
power 
favors photoelectric process 
low energy photons in heavy materials 
high energies in 
relativistic limit, 
energy dependence 
becomes simply egamma 
vacancy opened 
photoelectric effect filled 
another electron an upper shell, 
say l shell example 
this will result in either emission 
an xray energy el ek 
emission an auger electron, 
if available energy is greater 
ionization energy higher shells 
in compton scattering, dominant 
intermediate energies around mev, 
a photon is scattered a quasifree electron 
cross section is given 
kleinnishima formula is obtained 
quantum electrodynamics that 
well discuss in module 
energy scattered electron is 
maximum scattering angle is 
degrees a maximum electron 
energy that is given formula 
bottom this page 
compton scattering cross section 
is typically barn 
in forward direction 
backward scattering, 
varies between barn 
low energies barn kev 
high energy, process is thus dominated 
scattering in forward direction 
in electromagnetic field a nucleus, 
photon convert 
an electronpositron pair 
energy threshold is essentially 
twice mass electron 
a small correction 
recoil fo nucleus 
this process cannot take place in vacuum 
energymomentum conservation, 
little energy is transmitted to 
nucleus, mev heavy nuclei 
low 
modest energies crosssection per atom 
is given in terms radiation length 
this is length one 
we defined in video , ie, 
length an electron loses 
e energy bremsstrahlung 
in this image, taken a historical 
bubble chamber, we see tracks 
left charged particles small 
bubbles formed in an overheated liquid 
chamber is immersed in a magnetic 
field octagonal to projection plane, 
deflects trajectories 
this is an atypical process in that 
a photon enters left 
converts an electron positron pair 
in field an atomic electron 
in field a nucleus 
this produces is called a trident 
three 
charged particle tracks you see 
attached to left vertex 
pair particles lose 
energy in liquid, 
trajectories spirals 
that you see left 
atomic electron takes an appreciable 
recoil energy 
small mass 
stiff track goes to right 
little curvature 
halfway, 
electron emits a bremsstrahlung photon, 
in turn converts 
an electronpositron pair 
you see this pair vshaped 
tracks right 
crosssection pair production 
becomes almost independent 
photo energy 
an energy gev 
depends material, 
that is to say x 
conversion probability per unit 
distance is inversely proportional to 
radiation length 
mean free path 
a photon converts 
is inverse this probability 
thus a radiation length 
busy plot right shows 
summary contributions 
processes to photon 
total cross section in metal 
among this important ones 
photoelectric effect low energies 
pair production high energies 
in between around mev, 
minimum cross section, 
compton scattering dominates 
processes 
high energy, we seen 
energies gev, electrons 
positrons lose energy almost 
exclusively bremsstrahlung 
photons convert to electrons 
positrons pair production 
two phenomena 
characteristic length, 
radiation length 
successive combination 
two effects 
results in formation is 
called an electromagnetic shower 
whenever an electron, 
positron photon high 
energy enters a medium, 
will cause a shower 
a simulation is shown right 
again, black dot corresponds 
to a unit energy loss 
in next video, 
we will see ionization detectors 
measure passage charged particles
