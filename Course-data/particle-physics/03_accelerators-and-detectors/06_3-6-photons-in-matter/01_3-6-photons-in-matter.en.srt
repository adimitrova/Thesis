2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,153
In this module we are in the process of discussing
the basics of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:15,050
particle detection.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,220
In this video, we will demonstrate
how photons interact with matter.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,540
At the end of this video, you will know
the mechanisms by which they are detected,

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,842
namely, the photoelectric effect,
Compton scattering and pair production.

7
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:38,130
In these processes, the photon is either
absorbed or scattered by a wide angle.

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,470
Most of the photons in a beam
keep their original energy, but

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,630
their flux is diminished.

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,920
A photon beam will thus be
attenuated rather than lose energy.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,870
The probability of an interaction in
a given target thickness is a constant,

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,990
proportional to the cross
section of the process.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,720
This leads to an exponential decrease
of the intensity of a photon beam

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,640
as a function of absorber thickness.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,630
We've already calculated an example
of this in the optional video 1.3a.

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,520
Photons are detected by interactions
which produce charged particles.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,760
The photoelectric effect is the absorption
of a photon by an atomic electron, dominant

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,190
between the ionization energy of an atom
and about 100kV of photon energy.

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,520
Compton scattering is the elastic
scattering of a photon off a quasi-free

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,819
atomic electron, dominant around photon
energies roughly 1 MeV.

21
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:39,245
Pair production is the conversion of
a photon into an electron-positron pair

22
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:43,445
in the electromagnetic field of
typically of a nucleus, dominant for

23
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:47,365
photon energies much larger
than 1 MeV.

24
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:50,025
We will discuss these processes
one by one in what follows.

25
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:54,420
In the photoelectric process,

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,442
the atomic electron is released
when the atom absorbs the photon.

27
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,928
Its kinetic energy is then the difference
between the photon energy and

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,910
the ionization energy.

29
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,830
This latter one depends on the shell
where the electron was and

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,360
is typically between and
1 and 25 electron volts.

31
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,580
The photoelectric process is
not feasible for a free electron.

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,530
It would violate conservation of momentum.

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,840
If the photon energy
is larger than the K shell energy,

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,587
the cross section is dominated
at the level of roughly 80% by

35
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:30,080
the absorption of K shell electrons,

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,270
since the proximity of the nucleus
eases absorption of the recoil energy.

37
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,577
Sigma_Th, in this formula, is the standard
cross-section of Thompson scattering,

38
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:44,240
it sets the scale of this cross section.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,870
The dependence on the atomic
charge to the fifth power and

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,190
the photon energy to
the power -7/2

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,730
favors the photoelectric process for
low energy photons in heavy materials.

42
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,950
At high energies in
the relativistic limit,

43
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,720
the energy dependence
becomes simply 1/E_gamma.

44
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,690
The vacancy opened by
the photoelectric effect can be filled

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,250
by another electron of an upper shell,
say the L shell for example.

46
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,497
This will result in either the emission
of an X-ray with energy E_l- E_k or

47
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:23,079
the emission of an Auger electron,

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:29,031
if the available energy is greater than
the ionization energy for higher shells.

49
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:36,566
In Compton scattering, dominant at
intermediate energies around 1 MeV,

50
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:41,830
a photon is scattered off a quasi-free electron.

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,570
The cross section is given by the
Klein-Nishima formula which is obtained

52
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,510
by quantum electrodynamics that
we'll discuss in module 4.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,420
The energy of the scattered electron is
maximum when the scattering angle is 90

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,130
degrees with a maximum electron
energy that is given by the formula

55
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,210
on the bottom of this page.

56
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,840
The Compton scattering cross section

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,560
is typically about 0.1 barn
in the forward direction.

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,558
For backward scattering,
it varies between 0.1 barn

59
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:19,821
at low energies and 0.04 barn at 100 keV.

60
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:24,240
At high energy, the process is thus dominated
by scattering in the forward direction.

61
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,580
In the electromagnetic field of a nucleus,

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,180
the photon can convert into
an electron-positron pair.

63
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,800
The energy threshold is essentially
twice the mass of the electron

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,060
with a small correction for the
recoil fo the nucleus.

65
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,850
This process cannot take place in vacuum
because of energy-momentum conservation,

66
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,361
but little energy is transmitted to the
nucleus, about 1 MeV for heavy nuclei.

67
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,590
At low and
modest energies the cross-section per atom

68
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,110
is given in terms of the radiation length.

69
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,408
This is the same length as the one
we defined in video 3.5, i.e,

70
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:11,049
the length after which an electron loses
all but 1/e its energy by bremsstrahlung.

71
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:15,860
In this image, taken with a historical
bubble chamber, we see the tracks

72
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,840
left by charged particles as small
bubbles formed in an overheated liquid.

73
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,490
The chamber is immersed in a magnetic
field octagonal to the projection plane,

74
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,399
which deflects the trajectories.

75
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,360
This is an atypical process in that
a photon enters from the left and

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,750
converts into an electron positron pair
in the field of an atomic electron and

77
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,800
not in the field of a nucleus.

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,060
This produces what is called a trident.

79
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,540
These are the three

80
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,990
charged particle tracks you see
attached to the left vertex.

81
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,620
The pair particles lose
their energy in the liquid,

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,830
their trajectories are the spirals
that you see on the left.

83
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,530
The atomic electron takes an appreciable
recoil energy because of it's

84
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,140
small mass.

85
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,070
Its stiff track goes to the right
with very little curvature.

86
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,360
About halfway,
the electron emits a bremsstrahlung photon,

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,590
which in turn converts into
an electron-positron pair.

88
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,800
You see this pair by the V-shaped
tracks on the right.

89
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,720
The cross-section for pair production
becomes almost independent of

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,289
the photo energy above
an energy of about 1 GeV and

91
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,112
then depends only on the material,
that is to say on X_0.

92
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:39,706
The conversion probability per unit
distance is inversely proportional to

93
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,050
the radiation length.

94
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,820
The mean free path for
a photon before it converts

95
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,819
is the inverse of this probability and
thus 9/7 of a radiation length.

96
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,560
The busy plot on the right shows
the summary of the contributions

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,960
of all processes to the photon
total cross section in metal.

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,760
Among this the most important ones are the
photoelectric effect at low energies and

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,630
pair production at high energies

100
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,140
In between around 1 MeV, at
the minimum of the cross section,

101
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,800
Compton scattering dominates
over other processes.

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,180
At high energy, as we have seen at
energies above 1 GeV, electrons and

103
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,370
positrons lose their energy almost
exclusively by bremsstrahlung.

104
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,570
Photons convert to electrons and
positrons by pair production.

105
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,400
The two phenomena have the same
characteristic length,

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,130
the radiation length.

107
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,090
The successive combination
of these two effects

108
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,440
results in the formation of what is
called an electromagnetic shower.

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,900
Whenever an electron,

110
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,860
positron or photon of high
energy enters into a medium,

111
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,750
it will cause such a shower.

112
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,530
A simulation is shown on the right.

113
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,120
Again, each black dot corresponds
to a unit of energy loss.

114
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,813
In the next video,

115
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:05,126
we will see how ionization detectors
measure the passage of charged particles.
