this third module, we discussing techniques 
acceleration detection elementary particles 
this video, we invited to hall sm cern, a hall 
magnets large hadron collider tested in past 
spare magnets still checked 
a part this hall transformed an exhibition 
end this module, you will know to describe elements 
an accelerator know look like in real life 
so, let us meet todays host 
this video, we accompanied 
tobias golling, is one colleagues, 
professor university geneva, dedicates 
research to analysis data atlas experiment lhc 
so, tobis, 
you let us know exactly you in this domain 
yes, pleasure 
in short, i try to find new phenomena in data, 
group 
let put this in context standard model is a great success, 
describes visible matter, forces, well almost forces 
except one 
yes, except one 
higgs mechanism describes 
particules acquire a mass, higgs boson discovered 
cern in , so this is very, well set 
but, there weaknesses model 
example, cannot explain dark matter cannot explain 
gravity, that missing force, there phenomena, like, example, 
famous hierarchy problem, ie 
difference in scale 
exactly, between higgs mass scale gravity 
so, there open questions we to 
we ask theorist colleagues, 
formulate hypotheses, that there particles, 
that one must introduce particles beyond standard model, 
hypothesis is that one create new 
particle in collisions so i dedicate 
research to finding new particles, 
like particles predicted supersymmetry, theories extra dimensions 
so, this, predicted cross sections 
very, small, 
order of, smaller cross sections 
characterising standard model, thus 
we evidently need an high performance accelerator, a collider 
so, properties lhc, 
crucial research 
we expect that particles a large mass, 
that production rate is low 
so, two important parameters lhc this 
energy luminosity 
higher energy allows us to produce massive particles 
a higher luminosity 
means data, a higher production rate, 
events, observed 
lhc is a sort double accelerator 
storage ring, protons circulate in two directions 
so, in principle, is two accelerators in one, isnt 
exactly we principle twoinone, magnets lhc 
there two coils 
one need two accelerators 
there two proton beams in opposite directions 
so, one needs two magnetic fields 
one beam circulates in one direction 
yes 
in opposite direction 
meet interaction points 
yes 
we need lorenz force towards center orbit, 
so we need one magnetic field pointing upwards, one downwards 
this one uses dipole magnets 
so here, we almost sitting one dipole magnets, 
you explain elements magnets a little 
exactly 
so here, one sees two rings, two vacuum tubes, 
one sees two coils, one other, exactly same, 
difference is that current is reversed 
here is common yoke magnetic fields 
cryostat is also in common 
ok 
so, in one coils, there is an upward pointing magnetic field, 
in other, dipole field, pointing downward 
means that we deviating two beam in direction, 
even though opposite directions, simply 
applying lorentz law, gives centripetal force, 
we need, qv x b in this case 
exactly, 
right hand rule 
mh mh 
two coils in cryostat 
one simply build two separate magnets 
one reduce cost this way, 
a common cryostat two coils 
so, enormous energies 
lhc, one needs superconducting coils 
exactly 
ok 
that, in one cryostat 
so, coils made copper, arent 
maybe a few numbers magnetic system, 
show that is really important, 
even essential lhc 
km circumference, 
occupied magnets, magnet system 
ok 
dipoles, like this one 
so this is really heart matter 
magnets practically everywhere 
there magnets everywhere, right 
there , elements like this 
one weighs tons, 
m length a maximum magnetic field tesla 
so we see here is a small segment a dipole, 
in reality is much longer 
ok 
so this makes a gigantic cryogenic system, 
so, practically ring is cryogenic temperature, 
around length km 
yes 
so, later we will see superconducting cables, there tons 
superconducting cables needs tons superfluid helium 
to cool this mass to kelvin 
wow 
so i propose to move to see 
coils look 
also focalising elements lhc 
here we in front one quadruples lhc, serves to focalise two beams 
so, principle this focalisation explained in video , 
is important to focalise beams 
accelerator, tobias 
so, here we come back to luminosity, we already mentioned 
luminosity is inversely proportional 
to common surface two proton beams, 
that is one must focalise them, to reduce this surface 
here we see well 
a section a quadrupole magnet, is responsible focalisation 
one sees well four poles, here two north poles two south poles, 
here two version this magnet, one is responsible 
horizontal focalisation, one vertical one 
one alternates two 
puts in chains 
to an optimum focalisation 
so if we look coils, wires go effectively 
in this direction, dont 
exactly 
so here we in fact 
a section a coil you 
explain ingredients a coil 
yes 
coils composed superconducting cables, 
important, 
we said, there tons cables 
in fact composed strands, a diameter roughly mm 
strands composed 
filaments, ten times finer a human hair 
that means micrometers in diameter 
something like that 
is material 
is niobiumtitanium 
there is copper layer around 
this is normally imbedded in a sort aluminum stabiliser, 
that is there is this gray material 
yes, yes 
ok 
so this serves to wind coils active part 
magnets 
also to transport current around accelerator, doesnt 
exactly 
we cables around accelerator 
if one takes total length filaments, 
one arrives an astronomical scale 
one go five times to sun an back this 
is really incredible, this effort 
is made to produce particles 
you searching for, isnt 
in fact serves this purpose 
so, we still need to discuss an element accelerator 
we covered yet 
accelerating elements 
so i propose that we move to see look like in reality 
in this small video animation we see a cryostat contains four 
superconducting elements, ie radio frequency resonators 
radio frequency wave enters wave guides 
establishes an electric field right polarity, that 
beam is accelerated in direction motion 
so here is one elements 
tobias, you please explain ingredients this 
radio frequency cavity 
course a cavity 
you said, principle purpose to accelerate protons 
an energy gev, 
energy enter lhc, 
to tev, is maximum energy 
here we see wave guides, radio frequency 
generated klystron enter here leaves there 
lhc, a frequency mhz 
ok 
so inside, a stationary wave is formed 
polarity is right right time arrival protons, 
we will a net acceleration in direction electric field 
so, one synchronise this wave beam passage 
is important to monoenergetic beams 
so we must equalise proton energy 
so proton right energy 
enters right moment, there will acceleration 
if we already maximum energy level 
however, if protons arrive early late, 
ie energy is a little large small, an acceleration is felt 
protons decelerated accelerated to approach ideal energy 
this happens automatically, protons enter in increasing 
phase electric field, we seen in video 
so, this accelerating cavity, resonator is around, 
is made copper is emerged in a cryostat, holds 
liquid helium temperature, that copper is superconducting 
so is important that this structure 
also is superconducting 
yes, is important that there is a minimum 
ohmic resistance, that power 
wave is attenuated 
ok, this means that radio frequency wave 
arrives without loss klystron to beam 
exactly 
ok 
so, thank you much, tobias, this visit, 
this demonstration lhc elements 
this concludes this video 
in next video, 
we will start to discuss particle detection
