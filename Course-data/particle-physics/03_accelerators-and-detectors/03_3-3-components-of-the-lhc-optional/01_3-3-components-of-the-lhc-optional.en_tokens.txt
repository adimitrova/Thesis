during
this
third
module
,
we
are
discussing
techniques
for
the
acceleration
and
detection
of
elementary
particles
.
for
this
video
,
we
are
invited
to
hall
sm18
of
cern
,
a
hall
where
the
magnets
of
the
large
hadron
collider
have
been
tested
in
the
past
and
spare
magnets
are
still
being
checked
out
.
a
part
of
this
hall
has
been
transformed
into
an
exhibition
.
at
the
end
of
this
module
,
you
will
know
how
to
describe
the
elements
of
an
accelerator
and
know
how
they
look
like
in
real
life
.
so
,
let
us
meet
todayÃ¢ÂÂs
host
.
for
this
video
,
we
are
accompanied
by
tobias
golling
,
who
is
one
of
my
colleagues
,
professor
at
university
of
geneva
,
who
dedicates
100
%
of
his
research
to
the
analysis
of
data
from
the
atlas
experiment
at
the
lhc
.
so
,
tobis
,
can
you
let
us
know
what
exactly
you
are
doing
in
this
domain
?
>
>
yes
,
with
pleasure
.
in
short
,
i
try
to
find
new
phenomena
in
the
data
,
with
my
group
.
let
me
put
this
in
context
.
the
standard
model
is
a
great
success
,
it
describes
all
visible
matter
,
all
forces
,
well
almost
all
forces
.
>
>
except
one
.
>
>
yes
,
except
one
.
the
higgs
mechanism
describes
how
all
particules
acquire
a
mass
,
and
the
higgs
boson
has
been
discovered
at
cern
in
2012
,
so
all
of
this
is
very
,
very
well
set
.
but
,
there
are
weaknesses
of
the
model
.
for
example
,
it
can
not
explain
dark
matter
and
it
can
not
explain
gravity
,
that
his
the
missing
force
,
and
there
are
other
phenomena
,
like
,
for
example
,
the
famous
hierarchy
problem
,
i.e
.
>
>
the
difference
in
scaleÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
exactly
,
between
the
higgs
mass
and
the
scale
of
gravity
.
so
,
there
are
open
questions
.
what
are
we
to
do
?
we
can
ask
our
theorist
colleagues
,
and
they
formulate
hypotheses
,
that
there
are
particles
,
that
one
must
introduce
particles
beyond
the
standard
model
,
and
the
hypothesis
is
that
one
can
create
these
new
particle
in
our
collisions
.
so
i
dedicate
my
research
to
finding
new
particles
,
like
particles
predicted
by
supersymmetry
,
or
theories
with
extra
dimensions
.
>
>
so
,
for
this
,
the
predicted
cross
sections
are
very
,
very
small
,
are
they
not
?
>
>
they
are
of
the
order
of
,
or
smaller
than
the
cross
sections
characterising
the
standard
model
,
and
thus
we
evidently
need
an
high
performance
accelerator
,
a
collider
.
>
>
so
,
what
are
the
properties
of
the
lhc
,
which
are
crucial
for
your
research
?
>
>
we
expect
that
these
particles
have
a
very
large
mass
,
and
that
their
production
rate
is
very
low
.
so
,
the
two
most
important
parameters
of
the
lhc
for
this
are
the
energy
and
the
luminosity
.
higher
energy
allows
us
to
produce
more
massive
particles
.
>
>
and
a
higher
luminosityÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
it
means
more
data
,
a
higher
production
rate
,
more
events
,
which
can
be
observed
.
>
>
the
lhc
is
a
sort
of
double
accelerator
and
storage
ring
,
where
the
protons
circulate
in
two
directions
.
so
,
in
principle
,
it
is
two
accelerators
in
one
,
isnÃ¢ÂÂt
it
?
>
>
exactly
.
we
have
the
principle
of
two-in-one
,
for
all
the
magnets
of
the
lhc
there
are
two
coils
.
>
>
why
does
one
need
two
accelerators
?
>
>
because
there
are
two
proton
beams
in
opposite
directions
.
so
,
one
needs
two
magnetic
fields
.
>
>
one
beam
circulates
in
one
direction
.
>
>
yes
.
>
>
and
the
other
in
the
opposite
direction
.
and
they
meet
at
the
interaction
points
.
>
>
yes
.
we
need
the
same
lorenz
force
towards
the
center
of
the
orbit
,
so
we
need
one
magnetic
field
pointing
upwards
,
the
other
one
downwards
.
and
for
this
one
uses
these
dipole
magnets
.
>
>
so
here
,
we
are
almost
sitting
on
one
of
these
dipole
magnets
,
can
you
explain
the
elements
of
these
magnets
a
little
?
>
>
exactly
.
so
here
,
one
sees
the
two
rings
,
the
two
vacuum
tubes
,
and
one
sees
two
coils
,
one
and
the
other
,
which
are
exactly
the
same
,
the
only
difference
is
that
the
current
is
reversed
.
and
here
is
the
common
yoke
for
the
magnetic
fields
and
the
cryostat
is
also
in
common
.
>
>
ok.
so
,
in
one
of
these
coils
,
there
is
an
upward
pointing
magnetic
field
,
and
in
the
other
,
the
same
dipole
field
,
but
pointing
downward
.
with
means
that
we
are
deviating
the
two
beam
in
the
same
direction
,
even
though
they
have
opposite
directions
,
simply
applying
lorentzÃ¢ÂÂ
law
,
which
gives
the
centripetal
force
,
which
we
need
,
q
(
v
x
b
)
in
this
case
.
>
>
exactly
,
with
the
right
hand
rule
.
>
>
mh
mh
.
the
two
coils
are
in
the
same
cryostat
.
why
?
why
does
one
not
simply
build
two
separate
magnets
?
>
>
one
can
reduce
the
cost
this
way
,
having
a
common
cryostat
for
the
two
coils
.
>
>
so
,
for
the
enormous
energies
of
the
lhc
,
one
needs
superconducting
coils
.
>
>
exactly
.
>
>
ok.
and
because
of
that
,
all
are
in
one
cryostat
.
so
,
the
coils
themselves
are
made
of
copper
,
arenÃ¢ÂÂt
they
?
>
>
maybe
a
few
numbers
about
the
magnetic
system
,
which
show
that
it
is
really
very
important
,
even
essential
for
the
lhc
.
of
the
27
km
of
circumference
,
85
%
are
occupied
by
magnets
,
the
magnet
systemÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
ok.
>
>
Ã¢ÂÂ¦and
75
%
by
dipoles
,
like
this
one
.
>
>
so
this
is
really
the
heart
of
the
matter
.
magnets
are
practically
everywhere
.
>
>
there
are
magnets
everywhere
,
right
.
there
are
more
than
1000
,
more
than
1200
elements
like
this
.
each
one
weighs
30
tons
,
has
15m
length
and
a
maximum
magnetic
field
of
8.3
tesla
.
>
>
so
what
we
see
here
is
just
a
small
segment
of
a
dipole
,
which
in
reality
is
much
longer
.
>
>
ok.
so
this
makes
a
gigantic
cryogenic
system
,
so
,
practically
all
the
ring
is
at
cryogenic
temperature
,
all
around
its
length
of
27km
.
>
>
yes
.
so
,
later
we
will
see
the
superconducting
cables
,
there
are
1200
tons
of
superconducting
cables
and
it
needs
130
tons
of
superfluid
helium
to
cool
down
all
this
mass
to
1.9
kelvin
.
>
>
wow
.
>
>
so
i
propose
to
move
on
to
see
how
these
coils
look
and
also
the
focalising
elements
of
the
lhc
.
here
we
are
in
front
of
one
of
the
quadruples
of
the
lhc
,
which
serves
to
focalise
the
two
beams
.
so
,
the
principle
of
this
focalisation
has
been
explained
in
video
3.2
,
but
why
is
it
important
to
focalise
the
beams
of
the
accelerator
,
tobias
?
>
>
so
,
here
we
come
back
to
the
luminosity
,
which
we
have
already
mentioned
.
the
luminosity
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
common
surface
of
the
two
proton
beams
,
and
that
is
why
one
must
focalise
them
,
to
reduce
this
surface
.
and
here
we
see
very
well
a
section
of
a
quadrupole
magnet
,
which
is
responsible
for
the
focalisation
.
one
sees
very
well
the
four
poles
,
here
two
north
poles
and
two
south
poles
,
and
then
here
are
two
version
of
this
magnet
,
one
is
responsible
for
horizontal
focalisation
,
the
other
one
for
the
vertical
one
.
one
alternates
the
twoÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
puts
them
in
chains
.
>
>
Ã¢ÂÂ¦to
have
an
optimum
focalisation
.
>
>
so
if
we
look
at
the
coils
,
the
wires
go
effectively
in
this
direction
,
donÃ¢ÂÂt
they
?
>
>
exactly
.
>
>
so
here
we
have
in
fact
a
section
of
such
a
coil
.
can
you
explain
the
ingredients
of
such
a
coil
?
>
>
yes
.
all
coils
are
composed
of
superconducting
cables
,
they
are
very
important
,
as
we
said
,
there
are
1200
tons
of
these
cables
.
they
are
in
fact
composed
of
these
strands
,
with
a
diameter
of
roughly
1mm
.
and
these
strands
are
themselves
composed
of
filaments
,
which
are
ten
times
finer
than
a
human
hair
.
>
>
that
means
about
10
micrometers
in
diameter
?
>
>
something
like
that
.
>
>
what
is
the
material
?
>
>
it
is
niobium-titanium
.
and
there
is
copper
layer
around
.
>
>
and
all
of
this
is
normally
imbedded
in
a
sort
of
aluminum
stabiliser
,
that
is
why
there
is
this
gray
material
.
>
>
yes
,
yes
.
>
>
ok.
so
this
serves
to
wind
the
coils
of
the
active
part
of
the
magnets
.
but
also
to
transport
current
around
the
accelerator
,
doesnÃ¢ÂÂt
it
?
>
>
exactly
.
we
have
these
cables
all
around
the
accelerator
.
if
one
takes
the
total
length
of
the
filaments
,
one
arrives
at
an
astronomical
scale
.
one
can
go
five
times
to
the
sun
an
back
with
this
.
>
>
it
is
really
incredible
,
all
this
effort
which
is
made
to
produce
the
particles
you
are
searching
for
,
isnÃ¢ÂÂt
it
?
>
>
in
fact
it
serves
this
purpose
.
>
>
so
,
we
still
need
to
discuss
an
element
of
the
accelerator
which
we
have
not
covered
yet
.
these
are
the
accelerating
elements
themselves
.
so
i
propose
that
we
move
on
to
see
what
they
look
like
in
reality
.
in
this
small
video
animation
we
see
a
cryostat
which
contains
four
superconducting
elements
,
i.e
.
radio
frequency
resonators
.
the
radio
frequency
wave
enters
through
these
wave
guides
and
establishes
an
electric
field
with
the
right
polarity
,
such
that
the
beam
is
accelerated
in
its
direction
of
motion
.
so
here
is
one
of
these
elements
.
tobias
,
can
you
please
explain
these
ingredients
of
this
radio
frequency
cavity
?
>
>
of
course
.
such
a
cavity
has
as
you
said
,
the
principle
purpose
to
accelerate
protons
from
an
energy
of
450
gev
,
the
energy
with
which
they
enter
the
lhc
,
up
to
7
tev
,
which
is
their
maximum
energy
.
here
we
see
the
wave
guides
,
the
radio
frequency
generated
by
the
klystron
enter
here
and
leaves
there
.
for
the
lhc
,
they
have
a
frequency
of
400
mhz
.
>
>
ok.
so
inside
,
a
stationary
wave
is
formed
.
and
when
the
polarity
is
right
at
the
right
time
of
arrival
of
the
protons
,
we
will
have
a
net
acceleration
in
the
direction
of
the
electric
field
.
so
,
how
does
one
synchronise
this
wave
with
the
beam
passage
?
>
>
it
is
very
important
to
have
mono-energetic
beams
so
we
must
equalise
the
proton
energy
.
so
when
the
proton
with
the
right
energy
enters
at
the
right
moment
,
there
will
be
no
acceleration
if
we
are
already
at
the
maximum
energy
level
.
however
,
if
the
protons
arrive
too
early
or
too
late
,
i.e
.
when
their
energy
is
a
little
too
large
or
too
small
,
an
acceleration
is
felt
the
protons
are
decelerated
or
accelerated
to
approach
the
ideal
energy
.
this
happens
automatically
,
when
the
protons
enter
in
the
increasing
phase
of
the
electric
field
,
as
we
have
seen
in
video
3.2.
so
,
this
accelerating
cavity
,
the
resonator
and
all
what
is
around
,
is
made
of
copper
and
is
emerged
in
a
cryostat
,
which
holds
it
at
liquid
helium
temperature
,
such
that
the
copper
is
superconducting
.
>
>
so
why
is
it
important
that
this
structure
also
is
superconducting
?
>
>
yes
,
it
is
very
important
that
there
is
a
minimum
ohmic
resistance
,
such
that
the
power
of
the
wave
is
not
attenuated
.
>
>
ok
,
this
means
that
the
radio
frequency
wave
arrives
without
loss
from
the
klystron
to
the
beam
.
>
>
exactly
.
>
>
ok.
so
,
thank
you
very
much
,
tobias
,
for
this
visit
,
and
for
this
demonstration
of
the
lhc
elements
.
this
concludes
this
video
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
start
to
discuss
particle
detection
.
