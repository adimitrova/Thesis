2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,460
>> During this third module, we are discussing techniques 

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,980
for the acceleration and detection of elementary particles. 

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,340
For this video, we are invited to hall SM18 of CERN, a hall where

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,920
the magnets of the Large Hadron Collider have been tested in the past and

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,220
spare magnets are still being checked out. 

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,430
A part of this hall has been transformed into an exhibition. 

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,700
At the end of this module, you will know how to describe the elements 

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,220
of an accelerator and know how they look like in real life. 

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,790
So, let us meet today’s host. 

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,710
For this video, we are accompanied by

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,700
Tobias Golling, who is one of my colleagues,

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,680
professor at University of Geneva, who dedicates 100% of his

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,690
research to the analysis of data from the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.

15
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,440
So, Tobis,

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,350
can you let us know what exactly you are doing in this domain?

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,620
>> Yes, with pleasure. 

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,330
In short, I try to find new phenomena in the data,

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,560
with my group. 

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,040
Let me put this in context. The Standard Model is a great success,

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,580
it describes all visible matter, all forces, well almost all forces. 

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,350
>> Except one. 

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,545
>> Yes, except one. 

24
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:47,915
The Higgs mechanism describes how all 

25
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:51,985
particules acquire a mass, and the Higgs boson has been discovered

26
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,895
at CERN in 2012, so all of this is very, very well set. 

27
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:58,845
But, there are weaknesses of the model.

28
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:03,955
For example, it cannot explain dark matter and it cannot explain

29
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:09,910
gravity, that his the missing force, and there are other phenomena, like, for example, 

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,650
the famous hierarchy problem, i.e. 

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,905
>> the difference in scale…

32
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,270
>> exactly, between the Higgs mass and the scale of gravity.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,880
So, there are open questions. What are we to do?

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,130
We can ask our theorist colleagues,

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,310
and they formulate hypotheses, that there are particles,

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,820
that one must introduce particles beyond the Standard Model, 

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,800
and the hypothesis is that one can create these new

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,390
particle in our collisions. So I dedicate 

39
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,530
my research to finding new particles, 

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,260
like particles predicted by supersymmetry, or theories with extra dimensions. 

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,760
>> So, for this, the predicted cross sections 

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,540
are very, very small, are they not?

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,470
>> They are of the order of, or smaller than the cross sections

44
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,380
characterising the Standard Model, and thus 

45
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,230
we evidently need an high performance accelerator, a collider.

46
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,530
>> So, what are the properties of the LHC,

47
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,940
which are crucial for your research?

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,270
>> We expect that these particles have a very large mass,

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,540
and that their production rate is very low. 

50
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,990
So, the two most important parameters of the LHC for this 

51
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,740
are the energy and the luminosity. 

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,830
Higher energy allows us to produce more massive particles.

53
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,490
>> And a higher luminosity…

54
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,760
>> It means more data, a higher production rate,

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,670
more events, which can be observed. 

56
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,740
>> The LHC is a sort of double accelerator and

57
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,760
storage ring, where the protons circulate in two directions. 

58
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,740
So, in principle, it is two accelerators in one, isn’t it?

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,460
>> Exactly. We have the principle of two-in-one, for all the magnets of the LHC

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,100
there are two coils. 

61
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,150
>> Why does one need two accelerators?

62
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,998
>> Because there are two proton beams in opposite directions. 

63
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:32,390
So, one needs two magnetic fields. 

64
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,360
>> One beam circulates in one direction.
>> Yes.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,730
>> And the other in the opposite direction.

66
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,410
And they meet at the interaction points. 

67
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,420
>> Yes. 

68
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,740
We need the same Lorenz force towards the center of the orbit,

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,270
so we need one magnetic field pointing upwards, the other one downwards. 

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,670
And for this one uses these dipole magnets.

71
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,540
>> So here, we are almost sitting on one of these dipole magnets,

72
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,120
Can you explain the elements of these magnets a little?

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,690
>> Exactly. 

74
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,380
So here, one sees the two rings, the two vacuum tubes,

75
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,400
and one sees two coils, one and the other, which are exactly the same, 

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,010
the only difference is that the current is reversed. 

77
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,160
And here is the common yoke for the magnetic fields

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,090
and the cryostat is also in common. 

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,060
>> Ok. 

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,280
So, in one of these coils, there is an upward pointing magnetic field,

81
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,348
and in the other, the same dipole field, but pointing downward. 

82
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:39,390
With means that we are deviating the two beam in the same direction, 

83
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,520
even though they have opposite directions, simply

84
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,960
applying Lorentz’ law, which gives the centripetal force, 

85
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,465
which we need, q(v x B) in this case. 

86
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,900
>> Exactly, 

87
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,370
with the right hand rule. 

88
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,980
>> Mh mh.

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,730
The two coils are in the same cryostat. Why?

90
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,290
Why does one not simply build two separate magnets?

91
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,020
>> One can reduce the cost this way, 

92
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,630
having a common cryostat for the two coils. 

93
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,160
>> So, for the enormous energies of the 

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,750
LHC, one needs superconducting coils. 

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
>> Exactly. 

96
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,240
>> Ok. 

97
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,450
And because of that, all are in one cryostat. 

98
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:36,470
So, the coils themselves are made of copper, aren’t they?

99
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,510
>> Maybe a few numbers about the magnetic system,

100
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,980
which show that it is really very important,

101
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,600
even essential for the LHC. 

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,290
Of the 27 km of circumference, 85% are 

103
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,128
occupied by magnets, the magnet system… 
>> Ok. 

104
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,510
>> …and 75% by dipoles, like this one.

105
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,210
>> So this is really the heart of the matter.

106
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,270
Magnets are practically everywhere. 

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,440
>> There are magnets everywhere, right. 

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,930
There are more than 1000, more than 1200 elements like this. 

109
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,290
Each one weighs 30 tons,

110
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,620
has 15m length and a maximum magnetic field of 8.3 Tesla. 

111
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,950
>> So what we see here is just a small segment of a dipole,

112
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,210
which in reality is much longer. 

113
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,650
>> Ok. 

114
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,830
So this makes a gigantic cryogenic system,

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,600
so, practically all the ring is at cryogenic temperature, 

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,850
all around its length of 27km. 

117
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,790
>> Yes. 

118
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,150
So, later we will see the superconducting cables, there are 1200 tons of 

119
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,710
superconducting cables and it needs 130 tons of superfluid helium

120
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,480
to cool down all this mass to 1.9 Kelvin. 

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,380
>> Wow. 

122
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,330
>> So I propose to move on to see

123
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,920
how these coils look and

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,490
also the focalising elements of the LHC. 

125
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:16,640
Here we are in front of one of the quadruples of the LHC, which serves to focalise the two beams. 

126
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,108
So, the principle of this focalisation has been explained in video 3.2, 

127
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:26,910
but why is it important to focalise the beams

128
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,400
of the accelerator, Tobias?

129
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,670
>> So, here we come back to the luminosity, which we have already mentioned. 

130
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,200
The luminosity is inversely proportional 

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,230
to the common surface of the two proton beams,

132
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,690
and that is why one must focalise them, to reduce this surface. 

133
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,240
And here we see very well 

134
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,110
a section of a quadrupole magnet, which is responsible for the focalisation.

135
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,480
One sees very well the four poles, here two north poles and two south poles, and then

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,320
here are two version of this magnet, one is responsible for

137
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,165
horizontal focalisation, the other one for the vertical one. 

138
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,905
One alternates the two…

139
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,925
>> Puts them in chains.

140
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,665
>> …to have an optimum focalisation. 

141
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:30,565
>> So if we look at the coils, the wires go effectively

142
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,265
in this direction, don’t they?

143
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,375
>> Exactly.
>> So here we have in fact 

144
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,420
a section of such a coil. Can you

145
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,630
explain the ingredients of such a coil?

146
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,180
>> Yes.

147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,870
All coils are composed of superconducting cables, they are very 
important,

148
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,060
as we said, there are 1200 tons of these cables. 

149
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,906
They are in fact composed of these strands, with a diameter of roughly 1mm. 

150
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,480
And these strands are themselves composed of 

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,055
filaments, which are ten times finer than a human hair. 

152
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,590
>> That means about 10 micrometers in diameter?

153
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,060
>> Something like that. 

154
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,530
>> What is the material?

155
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,055
>> It is niobium-titanium.

156
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,790
And there is copper layer around. 

157
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,470
>> And all of this is normally imbedded in a sort of aluminum stabiliser, 

158
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,970
that is why there is this gray material. 

159
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,400
>> Yes, yes.

160
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,030
>> OK.
So this serves to wind the coils of the active part

161
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,690
of the magnets. 

162
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,520
But also to transport current around the accelerator, doesn’t it?

163
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,150
>> Exactly. 

164
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,770
We have these cables all around the accelerator. 

165
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,150
If one takes the total length of the filaments, 

166
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,820
one arrives at an astronomical scale. 

167
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,220
One can go five times to the sun an back with this. 

168
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,260
>> It is really incredible, all this effort

169
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,800
which is made to produce the particles

170
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,940
you are searching for, isn’t it?

171
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,510
>> In fact it serves this purpose. 

172
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,160
>> So, we still need to discuss an element of the accelerator

173
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,710
which we have not covered yet. 

174
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,600
These are the accelerating elements themselves. 

175
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,250
So I propose that we move on to see what they look like in reality.

176
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,950
In this small video animation we see a cryostat which contains four

177
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,360
superconducting elements, i.e. radio frequency resonators.  

178
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,800
The radio frequency wave enters through these wave guides

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,740
and establishes an electric field with the right polarity, such that

180
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,670
the beam is accelerated in its direction of motion. 

181
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,980
So here is one of these elements.

182
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,240
Tobias, can you please explain these ingredients of this 

183
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,600
radio frequency cavity?

184
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
>> Of course. Such a cavity has

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,850
as you said, the principle purpose to accelerate protons

186
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,540
from an energy of 450 GeV, 

187
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,450
the energy with which they enter the LHC, 

188
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,310
up to 7 TeV, which is their maximum energy. 

189
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,690
Here we see the wave guides, the radio frequency 

190
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,510
generated by the Klystron enter here and leaves there. 

191
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,830
For the LHC, they have a frequency of 400 MHz. 

192
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,790
>> OK. 

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,690
So inside, a stationary wave is formed.

194
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,080
And when the polarity is right at the right time of arrival of the protons, 

195
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,100
we will have a net acceleration in the direction of the electric field.  

196
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,600
So, how does one synchronise this wave with the beam passage?

197
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,730
>> It is very important to have mono-energetic beams

198
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,660
So we must equalise the proton energy. 

199
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,940
So when the proton with the right energy

200
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,410
enters at the right moment, there will be no acceleration

201
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,590
if we are already at the maximum energy level. 

202
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,710
However, if the protons arrive too early or too late, 

203
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:25,770
i.e. when their energy is a little too large or too small, an acceleration is felt

204
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,770
the protons are decelerated or accelerated to approach the ideal energy. 

205
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,710
This happens automatically, when the protons enter in the increasing 

206
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:44,360
phase of the electric field, as we have seen in video 3.2.

207
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,910
So, this accelerating cavity, the resonator and all what is around,

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,940
is made of copper and is emerged in a cryostat, which holds

209
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,630
it at liquid helium temperature, such that the copper is superconducting. 

210
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,760
>> So why is it important that this structure 

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,320
also is superconducting?

212
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,580
>> Yes, it is very important that there is a minimum 

213
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,020
ohmic resistance, such that the power 

214
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,996
of the wave is not attenuated. 

215
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:20,450
>> Ok, this means that the radio frequency wave 

216
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,940
arrives without loss from the klystron to the beam. 

217
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,790
>> Exactly.

218
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,100
>> Ok.

219
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,205
So, thank you very much, Tobias, for this visit,

220
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,925
and for this demonstration of the LHC elements. 

221
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:39,695
This concludes this video.

222
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,025
In the next video, 

223
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:46,760
we will start to discuss particle detection. 

224
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,264
