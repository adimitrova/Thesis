[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:15,483
In this module we touch upon the basic
properties of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,596
detection methods.

4
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:18,507
In this video and in the next,

5
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:22,720
we will discuss charged
particle detection techniques.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,060
First we talk about ionization
detectors in general, and gaseous ones,

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,041
in particular.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,885
After watching this video, you will
know how gaseous ionization detectors

9
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:34,950
count charge particles and
measure their trajectories, and

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,550
which operational modes
such a detector can have.

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,877
Ionization detectors detect the passage of
a charged particle by measuring the total

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,780
charge of electrons and/or ions 
produced by the ionization of the medium.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,980
This medium can be a gas,
a liquid, or a solid.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,220
To collect the electrons and

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,450
the ions before they recombine into atoms,
an electric field must be present,

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,390
which separates the charges and
makes them drift towards electrodes.

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,610
The charges induce a small
current on the electrodes,

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,040
a signal which can be detected
through an amplifier.

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,549
The average number of
electron-ion pairs

20
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,263
produced during the passage
of a charged particle

21
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:19,560
is given by the Bethe-Bloch formula
that we have presented earlier.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,370
With d being the thickness
of the detector, and W,

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,820
the average energy required
to ionize one of its atoms.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,210
In a gas, W is typically of
the order of 30 eV.

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,760
The size of the detected electrical signal
depends on several technical factors, but

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,587
mostly on the applied high voltage.

27
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:43,298
So this graph shows the most
important operational regions.

28
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:48,394
On the y-axis you see the detected
charge in a logarithmic scale,

29
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:52,400
and on the x-axis you see
the applied high voltage.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,417
The first useful region for particle
detection is the ionization region,

31
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:02,601
where the voltage is large enough to
prevent ion-electron recombination

32
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:06,000
and the ionization charges
drift towards the electrodes.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,590
The resulting signal reflects then
the total ionization charge.

34
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,360
The advantage of this operational region

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,070
is that you obtain an excellent energy
resolution at a very good linearity.

36
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,660
The obvious disadvantage is that
the detected signal is very small,

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,290
since there's no internal
amplification in the detector itself.

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,703
So special low-noise
amplifiers have to be used

39
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:37,250
in order to render this signal detectable.

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,508
This operational mode is used in
ionization chambers filled with gases or

41
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,990
noble liquids.

42
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,350
Also, solid state detectors
made of silicone or

43
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,134
germanium, which will be discussed in
the next video, work in this region.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,420
The next useful region for particle
detection is the proportional region.

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,900
If the field is high enough, of
the order of 10^4 V/cm,

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,340
electrons are accelerated by the electric field and

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,730
gain enough energy to
produce secondary ionization.

48
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,428
The total number of atoms ionized grows
exponentially with the applied voltage,

49
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:13,797
as shown in this graph.

50
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:19,180
The amplification factor is between
10^4 and 10^8.

51
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,504
And the large amplification factor
can especially be obtained in gases,

52
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:27,840
which is why detectors operating in
this region are mostly gas-filled.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,897
The advantage of using this region is that
there's no need to have a very low-noise

54
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:38,260
electronics, since there's internal
amplification in the detector itself.

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,570
The disadvantage is that
the energy resolution is worse,

56
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,820
because of fluctuations in
the amplification process.

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,240
These fluctuations are mainly due to
instabilities in external parameters,

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,950
like the high-voltage,
the temperature, the pressure, etc.

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,600
Detectors operating in
the proportional region are mainly

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,680
used to measure the position of particles.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,330
Drift chambers, proportional wire chambers
and so on, use this operational region.

62
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,372
In these chambers, the electric field
is implemented using thin wires,

63
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:12,840
to put as little material as
possible in the path of the particle

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,837
As an example, we show here, the central
drift chamber of the L3 detector at

65
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:24,850
the Large Electron-Positron Collider
at CERN.

66
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,306
As the particles lose very little
energy in the gas by dE/dx,

67
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:32,174
the measurement is not destructive.

68
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:36,444
Wire chambers are ideal to measure charged
particle tracks in front of a colorimeter,

69
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:40,140
which will then measure
the particle energy by absorption.

70
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,646
We'll talk about spectrometers and
colorimeters in video 3.10.

71
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,910
The last useful region of

72
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:54,340
gazeous ionization detectors
is the Geiger region.

73
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,160
If the field is increased even more,

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,080
the energies of secondary
electrons increase rapidly.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,770
And they excite or ionize other atoms.

76
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,015
Thus, an avalanche of free
electrons is produced.

77
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:10,095
Furthermore, a large number of photons
is produced when the atoms fall back

78
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,245
into their ground state.

79
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:15,759
These photons add to the ionization
by photoelectric effect along

80
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,071
the wire where the electric
field is strongest.

81
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:24,060
The avalanche develops quickly and
an audible discharge is produced.

82
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,920
This is the principle
of the Geiger counter.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,222
Due to the discharge,
the current on the anode is saturated.

84
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:34,520
The signal amplitude is thus
independent of the primary charge.

85
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,174
The advantage of using this region
is that low radiation levels can be

86
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:45,139
measured by counting particle rate,
even if the particles have low energy.

87
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,345
The disadvantage is that the energy of
the particles cannot be measured.

88
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:53,992
The discharge stops when the space
charge formed by the positive ions

89
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:58,400
around the anode decreases sufficiently
the electric field so

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,820
that the avalanche process stops.

91
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,980
The detector will be
insensitive to new ionization

92
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,780
until the positive ions have
migrated far enough from the anode.

93
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,580
This is the origin of dead
time in a Geiger counter.

94
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:18,110
A further increase in the electric
field produces a permanent discharge.

95
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:26,690
A short circuit between cathode and anode,
which will eventually destroy the device.

96
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,853
Here's a picture of a Geiger counter,

97
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,746
which makes an audible sound
every time a particle is counted.

98
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:39,200
And in fact,
I've brought a Geiger counter here.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,050
It has the Geiger tube fixed
to the electronics and

100
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,080
the counting device in this base.

101
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,185
So if I switch it on.

102
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:57,133
[SOUND] You can hear the audible
sound created by the device.

103
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:01,345
The counting rate is mostly due to

104
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:06,203
the Potassium radioactive
isotopes inside my own body.

105
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:10,235
In the next video, Mercedes will discuss
semiconductor-based ionization detectors.

106
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:16,943
[SOUND]
