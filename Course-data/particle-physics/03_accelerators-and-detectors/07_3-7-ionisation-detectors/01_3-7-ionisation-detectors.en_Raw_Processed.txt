music 
in this module we touch upon basic 
properties particle acceleration 
detection methods 
in this video in next, 
we will discuss charged 
particle detection techniques 
first we talk ionization 
detectors in general, gaseous ones, 
in particular 
watching this video, you will 
know gaseous ionization detectors 
count charge particles 
measure trajectories, 
operational modes 
a detector 
ionization detectors detect passage 
a charged particle measuring total 
charge electrons andor ions 
produced ionization medium 
this medium a gas, 
a liquid, a solid 
to collect electrons 
ions recombine atoms, 
an electric field must present, 
separates charges 
makes drift towards electrodes 
charges induce a small 
current electrodes, 
a signal detected 
an amplifier 
average number 
electronion pairs 
produced passage 
a charged particle 
is given bethebloch formula 
that we presented earlier 
d thickness 
detector, w, 
average energy required 
to ionize one atoms 
in a gas, w is typically 
order ev 
size detected electrical signal 
depends several technical factors, 
mostly applied high voltage 
so this graph shows 
important operational regions 
yaxis you see detected 
charge in a logarithmic scale, 
xaxis you see 
applied high voltage 
first useful region particle 
detection is ionization region, 
voltage is large enough to 
prevent ionelectron recombination 
ionization charges 
drift towards electrodes 
resulting signal reflects 
total ionization charge 
advantage this operational region 
is that you obtain an excellent energy 
resolution a good linearity 
obvious disadvantage is that 
detected signal is small, 
since theres internal 
amplification in detector 
so special lownoise 
amplifiers to used 
in order to render this signal detectable 
this operational mode is used in 
ionization chambers filled gases 
noble liquids 
also, solid state detectors 
made silicone 
germanium, will discussed in 
next video, work in this region 
next useful region particle 
detection is proportional region 
if field is high enough, 
order vcm, 
electrons accelerated electric field 
gain enough energy to 
produce secondary ionization 
total number atoms ionized grows 
exponentially applied voltage, 
shown in this graph 
amplification factor is between 

large amplification factor 
especially obtained in gases, 
is detectors operating in 
this region mostly gasfilled 
advantage using this region is that 
theres need to a lownoise 
electronics, since theres internal 
amplification in detector 
disadvantage is that 
energy resolution is worse, 
fluctuations in 
amplification process 
fluctuations mainly due to 
instabilities in external parameters, 
like highvoltage, 
temperature, pressure, etc 
detectors operating in 
proportional region mainly 
used to measure position particles 
drift chambers, proportional wire chambers 
so on, use this operational region 
in chambers, electric field 
is implemented using thin wires, 
to put little material 
possible in path particle 
an example, we show here, central 
drift chamber l detector 
large electronpositron collider 
cern 
particles lose little 
energy in gas dedx, 
measurement is destructive 
wire chambers ideal to measure charged 
particle tracks in front a colorimeter, 
will measure 
particle energy absorption 
well talk spectrometers 
colorimeters in video 
last useful region 
gazeous ionization detectors 
is geiger region 
if field is increased even more, 
energies secondary 
electrons increase rapidly 
excite ionize atoms 
thus, an avalanche free 
electrons is produced 
furthermore, a large number photons 
is produced atoms fall back 
ground state 
photons add to ionization 
photoelectric effect along 
wire electric 
field is strongest 
avalanche develops quickly 
an audible discharge is produced 
this is principle 
geiger counter 
due to discharge, 
current anode is saturated 
signal amplitude is thus 
independent primary charge 
advantage using this region 
is that low radiation levels 
measured counting particle rate, 
even if particles low energy 
disadvantage is that energy 
particles cannot measured 
discharge stops space 
charge formed positive ions 
around anode decreases sufficiently 
electric field so 
that avalanche process stops 
detector will 
insensitive to new ionization 
until positive ions 
migrated far enough anode 
this is origin dead 
time in a geiger counter 
a increase in electric 
field produces a permanent discharge 
a short circuit between cathode anode, 
will eventually destroy device 
heres a picture a geiger counter, 
makes an audible sound 
every time a particle is counted 
in fact, 
ive brought a geiger counter here 
geiger tube fixed 
to electronics 
counting device in this base 
so if i switch 
sound you hear audible 
sound created device 
counting rate is mostly due to 
potassium radioactive 
isotopes inside body 
in next video, mercedes will discuss 
semiconductorbased ionization detectors
