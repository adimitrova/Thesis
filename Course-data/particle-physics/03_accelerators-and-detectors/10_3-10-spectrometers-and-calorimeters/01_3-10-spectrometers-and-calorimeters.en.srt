[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:14,587
In this module, we are discussing
the basics of particle acceleration and

3
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,285
detection methods.

4
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:21,595
In this video, you will see how different
technologies are combined to build

5
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:27,155
the two basic types of particle detectors,
spectrometers, and calorimeters.

6
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:31,595
At the end of this video, you will be able
to describe how a spectrometer measures

7
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:36,590
the direction and momentum of a charged
particle in a nondestructive manner.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,835
And to describe how a calorimeter measures
the direction and energy of a particle by

9
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:41,890
total absorption.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,390
You will also be able to identify
the strength of these two basic

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,320
methods and their synergy.

12
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,790
A magnetic spectrometer is used
to measure the direction and

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,840
momentum of a particle
with minimal interaction.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,300
It is a nondestructive method
to measure these properties.

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,130
The particle trajectory is measured
in a known magnetic field.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,990
For a homogeneous field, the trajectory is
a spiral, a circle in the plane orthogonal

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,810
to the field, and a straight line
in the direction of the field.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,968
The radius of curvature is proportional to
what is called the magnetic rigidity R,

19
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:20,743
which is the ratio between the momentum p,
and the charge Z.

20
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:25,424
R = p/Z, and can be
measured by the product of the radius

21
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:29,030
of curvature and the magnetic field.

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,682
The magnetic field itself is provided by
a permanent magnet or an electromagnet.

23
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:37,405
Measurements of the path are performed
by an ionization detector,

24
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:41,860
a gas filled wire chamber, for example,
or layers of semiconductor detectors.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,490
The tangent to the trajectory
at the entry of the magnet

26
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,829
gives the direction of
the incident particle.

27
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,430
As an example, here's, again, a photo of
the drift chamber from the L3

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,600
experiment at the Large Electron-
Positron collider at CERN as well as a picture

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,400
of an e+e- annihilation
into hedrons on the right side.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,969
The reaction takes place in
the middle of the device,

31
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,441
the center of the image on the right.

32
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:13,757
In the central part, you see the tracks of
charged particles in yellow reconstructed

33
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:18,390
from the measured coordinates
indicated by the small green crosses.

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,959
The curvature is barely visible but

35
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,525
well-measured by the high
resolution drift chamber.

36
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,454
In this photograph on the left,

37
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:31,435
you see a central detector
made out of silicone sensors,

38
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,455
the one that is used by
the ATLAS experiment.

39
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:38,205
The right image is a reconstruction of a
reaction between protons in the middle of

40
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,435
the device.

41
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,075
The charged particles, which are produced,

42
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,615
leave tracks forming circles
orthogonal to the magnetic field.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,280
The purpose of a calorimeter
is to measure the energy and

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,390
direction of particles by absorbing them.

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,570
The principle of operation
is the following.

46
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,700
The incident particle initiates
a shower of particles in the detector,

47
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,840
an electromagnetic shower,
or a hadronic shower.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,250
The shape, size, and composition of the
shower depends on the incident particle.

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,520
But also on the detector material,
namely,

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,120
its radiation length,
its nuclear interaction length.

51
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,390
The energy is deposited in the form of
heat, which is not very useful, but

52
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,570
also produces detectable signals,
like ionization and excitation

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,350
by dE/dx, scintillation light,
Cherenkov radiation, etc.

54
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,280
This energy is detected by sensors.

55
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,120
The resulting signal is proportional to
the total energy deposited by the particle

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,770
of the shower in the active
medium of the detector.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,820
There are two kinds of calorimeters,
homogenous ones with only one material to

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,330
absorb and detect the shower particles and
layered calorimeters,

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,545
which use different materials for
interaction, absorption and detection.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,026
Here's an example of a layered calorimeter.

61
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,800
In such a calorimeter, layers alternate.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,184
There are absorption layers made of heavy
materials like copper, lead, or

63
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,245
uranium with the short
radiation in direction.

64
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:16,190
Here, particles interact and
form a shower.

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,260
In the sensitive layers,
the energy lost by dE/dx is recorded.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,670
These layers may be
equipped with a gaseous or

67
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,450
noble liquid, a proportional chamber,
a semiconductor sensor, or a scintillator.

68
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,470
You see here, the electromagnetic
calorimeter of ATLAS which contains absorption

69
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,020
layers of lead and steel alternating with
sensitive layers filled with liquid argon.

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,230
The whole has a shape
resembling an accordion.

71
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,100
In a homogenous calorimeter on the other
hand, the two functions are combined.

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,190
The same material is used as an absorber
and as a detector for deposited energy.

73
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,650
Scintillators made of heavy
materials can be used,

74
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,340
like bismuth germanate,
BGO, or lead tungstate.

75
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,230
Because of the short radiation length and
the transparency of these materials,

76
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,450
they are often used to detect
electromagnetic showers.

77
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,858
The scintillation light,
emitted by the electrons of the shower,

78
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:15,808
is detected by photomultipliers or
by semiconductor photodiodes,

79
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,121
as in this example,

80
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:22,252
which shows you the lead tungstate
calorimeter of the CMS experiment at LHC.

81
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:33,608
Calorimeters are also one of the main
applications of plastic scintillators.

82
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:38,910
The large calorimeter for hadron showers of
the ATLAS experiment is an example.

83
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,650
Here, you see a small animation
showing the structure of

84
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,760
one of its wedge-shaped slices.

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,540
It uses scintillated tiles
inserted between steel absorbers

86
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,860
to measure the energy of hadrons.

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,530
The shower develops mainly
in the metal layers.

88
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,574
The charged particles it generates produce
scintillation light in the sensitive

89
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,240
layers.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,275
The scintillation light is
collected by optical fibers and

91
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,219
guided to photo detectors.

92
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,073
In this way, a three-dimensional
image of the shower is measured,

93
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:13,573
which allows to reconstruct direction and
energy of hadrons.

94
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:28,000
But also the Cherenkov effect allows
to build complete detectors.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,003
The Super-Kamiokande Detector in Japan
consists of a huge cylindrical tank,

96
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:38,223
which contains 50,000
tons of ultra pure water.

97
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:42,601
When a charged particle passes through
the water at the speed beyond that of

98
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:47,392
the speed of light in water, which is
about 75% of the speed of light in vacuum,

99
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,505
a cone of light is emitted.

100
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:53,280
This cone is intercepted by an array
of photomultipliers distributed

101
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,790
on the walls.

102
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,140
They detect an ellipse of photons, which
allows to reconstruct the direction and

103
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,640
velocity of the particle.

104
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,360
Lateral and longitudinal segmentation
allows to distinguish between hadrons and

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,950
particles, which interact only via the
electromagnetic force, like electrons and

106
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,380
photons, or muons.

107
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,510
As a general rule,

108
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,050
one can say that electromagnetic
showers are short, slim and regular.

109
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,809
Hadronic showers are penetrating,
wide, and irregular.

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,560
Because of the different characteristics
of electromagnetic and hadronic showers,

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,630
they are often two calorimeters,
a fine grain electromagnetic one and

112
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,070
a coarser hadron calorimeter.

113
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,800
But it is the synergy between
different detector types that

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,090
allows to both identify particles and
measure their direction and energy.

115
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,987
This is further explained
in optional video 3.10a,

116
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:50,442
which shows how the ATLAS
detector at LHC works.

117
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:54,819
In the next video, we will show which
types of particle detectors are developed

118
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,298
and produced in our laboratories
at the University of Geneva.

119
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:04,279
