in
this
module
,
we
are
discussing
the
basics
of
particle
acceleration
and
detection
methods
.
in
this
video
,
you
will
see
how
different
technologies
are
combined
to
build
the
two
basic
types
of
particle
detectors
,
spectrometers
,
and
calorimeters
.
at
the
end
of
this
video
,
you
will
be
able
to
describe
how
a
spectrometer
measures
the
direction
and
momentum
of
a
charged
particle
in
a
nondestructive
manner
.
and
to
describe
how
a
calorimeter
measures
the
direction
and
energy
of
a
particle
by
total
absorption
.
you
will
also
be
able
to
identify
the
strength
of
these
two
basic
methods
and
their
synergy
.
a
magnetic
spectrometer
is
used
to
measure
the
direction
and
momentum
of
a
particle
with
minimal
interaction
.
it
is
a
nondestructive
method
to
measure
these
properties
.
the
particle
trajectory
is
measured
in
a
known
magnetic
field
.
for
a
homogeneous
field
,
the
trajectory
is
a
spiral
,
a
circle
in
the
plane
orthogonal
to
the
field
,
and
a
straight
line
in
the
direction
of
the
field
.
the
radius
of
curvature
is
proportional
to
what
is
called
the
magnetic
rigidity
r
,
which
is
the
ratio
between
the
momentum
p
,
and
the
charge
z.
r
=
p/z
,
and
can
be
measured
by
the
product
of
the
radius
of
curvature
and
the
magnetic
field
.
the
magnetic
field
itself
is
provided
by
a
permanent
magnet
or
an
electromagnet
.
measurements
of
the
path
are
performed
by
an
ionization
detector
,
a
gas
filled
wire
chamber
,
for
example
,
or
layers
of
semiconductor
detectors
.
the
tangent
to
the
trajectory
at
the
entry
of
the
magnet
gives
the
direction
of
the
incident
particle
.
as
an
example
,
here
's
,
again
,
a
photo
of
the
drift
chamber
from
the
l3
experiment
at
the
large
electron-
positron
collider
at
cern
as
well
as
a
picture
of
an
e+e-
annihilation
into
hedrons
on
the
right
side
.
the
reaction
takes
place
in
the
middle
of
the
device
,
the
center
of
the
image
on
the
right
.
in
the
central
part
,
you
see
the
tracks
of
charged
particles
in
yellow
reconstructed
from
the
measured
coordinates
indicated
by
the
small
green
crosses
.
the
curvature
is
barely
visible
but
well-measured
by
the
high
resolution
drift
chamber
.
in
this
photograph
on
the
left
,
you
see
a
central
detector
made
out
of
silicone
sensors
,
the
one
that
is
used
by
the
atlas
experiment
.
the
right
image
is
a
reconstruction
of
a
reaction
between
protons
in
the
middle
of
the
device
.
the
charged
particles
,
which
are
produced
,
leave
tracks
forming
circles
orthogonal
to
the
magnetic
field
.
the
purpose
of
a
calorimeter
is
to
measure
the
energy
and
direction
of
particles
by
absorbing
them
.
the
principle
of
operation
is
the
following
.
the
incident
particle
initiates
a
shower
of
particles
in
the
detector
,
an
electromagnetic
shower
,
or
a
hadronic
shower
.
the
shape
,
size
,
and
composition
of
the
shower
depends
on
the
incident
particle
.
but
also
on
the
detector
material
,
namely
,
its
radiation
length
,
its
nuclear
interaction
length
.
the
energy
is
deposited
in
the
form
of
heat
,
which
is
not
very
useful
,
but
also
produces
detectable
signals
,
like
ionization
and
excitation
by
de/dx
,
scintillation
light
,
cherenkov
radiation
,
etc
.
this
energy
is
detected
by
sensors
.
the
resulting
signal
is
proportional
to
the
total
energy
deposited
by
the
particle
of
the
shower
in
the
active
medium
of
the
detector
.
there
are
two
kinds
of
calorimeters
,
homogenous
ones
with
only
one
material
to
absorb
and
detect
the
shower
particles
and
layered
calorimeters
,
which
use
different
materials
for
interaction
,
absorption
and
detection
.
here
's
an
example
of
a
layered
calorimeter
.
in
such
a
calorimeter
,
layers
alternate
.
there
are
absorption
layers
made
of
heavy
materials
like
copper
,
lead
,
or
uranium
with
the
short
radiation
in
direction
.
here
,
particles
interact
and
form
a
shower
.
in
the
sensitive
layers
,
the
energy
lost
by
de/dx
is
recorded
.
these
layers
may
be
equipped
with
a
gaseous
or
noble
liquid
,
a
proportional
chamber
,
a
semiconductor
sensor
,
or
a
scintillator
.
you
see
here
,
the
electromagnetic
calorimeter
of
atlas
which
contains
absorption
layers
of
lead
and
steel
alternating
with
sensitive
layers
filled
with
liquid
argon
.
the
whole
has
a
shape
resembling
an
accordion
.
in
a
homogenous
calorimeter
on
the
other
hand
,
the
two
functions
are
combined
.
the
same
material
is
used
as
an
absorber
and
as
a
detector
for
deposited
energy
.
scintillators
made
of
heavy
materials
can
be
used
,
like
bismuth
germanate
,
bgo
,
or
lead
tungstate
.
because
of
the
short
radiation
length
and
the
transparency
of
these
materials
,
they
are
often
used
to
detect
electromagnetic
showers
.
the
scintillation
light
,
emitted
by
the
electrons
of
the
shower
,
is
detected
by
photomultipliers
or
by
semiconductor
photodiodes
,
as
in
this
example
,
which
shows
you
the
lead
tungstate
calorimeter
of
the
cms
experiment
at
lhc
.
calorimeters
are
also
one
of
the
main
applications
of
plastic
scintillators
.
the
large
calorimeter
for
hadron
showers
of
the
atlas
experiment
is
an
example
.
here
,
you
see
a
small
animation
showing
the
structure
of
one
of
its
wedge-shaped
slices
.
it
uses
scintillated
tiles
inserted
between
steel
absorbers
to
measure
the
energy
of
hadrons
.
the
shower
develops
mainly
in
the
metal
layers
.
the
charged
particles
it
generates
produce
scintillation
light
in
the
sensitive
layers
.
the
scintillation
light
is
collected
by
optical
fibers
and
guided
to
photo
detectors
.
in
this
way
,
a
three-dimensional
image
of
the
shower
is
measured
,
which
allows
to
reconstruct
direction
and
energy
of
hadrons
.
but
also
the
cherenkov
effect
allows
to
build
complete
detectors
.
the
super-kamiokande
detector
in
japan
consists
of
a
huge
cylindrical
tank
,
which
contains
50,000
tons
of
ultra
pure
water
.
when
a
charged
particle
passes
through
the
water
at
the
speed
beyond
that
of
the
speed
of
light
in
water
,
which
is
about
75
%
of
the
speed
of
light
in
vacuum
,
a
cone
of
light
is
emitted
.
this
cone
is
intercepted
by
an
array
of
photomultipliers
distributed
on
the
walls
.
they
detect
an
ellipse
of
photons
,
which
allows
to
reconstruct
the
direction
and
velocity
of
the
particle
.
lateral
and
longitudinal
segmentation
allows
to
distinguish
between
hadrons
and
particles
,
which
interact
only
via
the
electromagnetic
force
,
like
electrons
and
photons
,
or
muons
.
as
a
general
rule
,
one
can
say
that
electromagnetic
showers
are
short
,
slim
and
regular
.
hadronic
showers
are
penetrating
,
wide
,
and
irregular
.
because
of
the
different
characteristics
of
electromagnetic
and
hadronic
showers
,
they
are
often
two
calorimeters
,
a
fine
grain
electromagnetic
one
and
a
coarser
hadron
calorimeter
.
but
it
is
the
synergy
between
different
detector
types
that
allows
to
both
identify
particles
and
measure
their
direction
and
energy
.
this
is
further
explained
in
optional
video
3.10a
,
which
shows
how
the
atlas
detector
at
lhc
works
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
show
which
types
of
particle
detectors
are
developed
and
produced
in
our
laboratories
at
the
university
of
geneva
.
