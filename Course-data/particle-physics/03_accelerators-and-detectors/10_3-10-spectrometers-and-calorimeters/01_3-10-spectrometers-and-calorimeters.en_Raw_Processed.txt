in this module, we discussing 
basics particle acceleration 
detection methods 
in this video, you will see different 
technologies combined to build 
two basic types particle detectors, 
spectrometers, calorimeters 
end this video, you will able 
to describe a spectrometer measures 
direction momentum a charged 
particle in a nondestructive manner 
to describe a calorimeter measures 
direction energy a particle 
total absorption 
you will also able to identify 
strength two basic 
methods synergy 
a magnetic spectrometer is used 
to measure direction 
momentum a particle 
minimal interaction 
is a nondestructive method 
to measure properties 
particle trajectory is measured 
in a known magnetic field 
a homogeneous field, trajectory is 
a spiral, a circle in plane orthogonal 
to field, a straight line 
in direction field 
radius curvature is proportional to 
is called magnetic rigidity r, 
is ratio between momentum p, 
charge z 
r pz, 
measured product radius 
curvature magnetic field 
magnetic field is provided 
a permanent magnet an electromagnet 
measurements path performed 
an ionization detector, 
a gas filled wire chamber, example, 
layers semiconductor detectors 
tangent to trajectory 
entry magnet 
gives direction 
incident particle 
an example, heres, again, a photo 
drift chamber l 
experiment large electron 
positron collider cern well a picture 
an ee annihilation 
hedrons right side 
reaction takes place in 
middle device, 
center image right 
in central part, you see tracks 
charged particles in yellow reconstructed 
measured coordinates 
indicated small green crosses 
curvature is barely visible 
wellmeasured high 
resolution drift chamber 
in this photograph left, 
you see a central detector 
made silicone sensors, 
one that is used 
atlas experiment 
right image is a reconstruction a 
reaction between protons in middle 
device 
charged particles, produced, 
leave tracks forming circles 
orthogonal to magnetic field 
purpose a calorimeter 
is to measure energy 
direction particles absorbing 
principle operation 
is following 
incident particle initiates 
a shower particles in detector, 
an electromagnetic shower, 
a hadronic shower 
shape, size, composition 
shower depends incident particle 
also detector material, 
namely, 
radiation length, 
nuclear interaction length 
energy is deposited in form 
heat, is useful, 
also produces detectable signals, 
like ionization excitation 
dedx, scintillation light, 
cherenkov radiation, etc 
this energy is detected sensors 
resulting signal is proportional to 
total energy deposited particle 
shower in active 
medium detector 
there two kinds calorimeters, 
homogenous ones one material to 
absorb detect shower particles 
layered calorimeters, 
use different materials 
interaction, absorption detection 
heres an example a layered calorimeter 
in a calorimeter, layers alternate 
there absorption layers made heavy 
materials like copper, lead, 
uranium short 
radiation in direction 
here, particles interact 
form a shower 
in sensitive layers, 
energy lost dedx is recorded 
layers may 
equipped a gaseous 
noble liquid, a proportional chamber, 
a semiconductor sensor, a scintillator 
you see here, electromagnetic 
calorimeter atlas contains absorption 
layers lead steel alternating 
sensitive layers filled liquid argon 
whole a shape 
resembling an accordion 
in a homogenous calorimeter 
hand, two functions combined 
material is used an absorber 
a detector deposited energy 
scintillators made heavy 
materials used, 
like bismuth germanate, 
bgo, lead tungstate 
short radiation length 
transparency materials, 
often used to detect 
electromagnetic showers 
scintillation light, 
emitted electrons shower, 
is detected photomultipliers 
semiconductor photodiodes, 
in this example, 
shows you lead tungstate 
calorimeter cms experiment lhc 
calorimeters also one main 
applications plastic scintillators 
large calorimeter hadron showers 
atlas experiment is an example 
here, you see a small animation 
showing structure 
one wedgeshaped slices 
uses scintillated tiles 
inserted between steel absorbers 
to measure energy hadrons 
shower develops mainly 
in metal layers 
charged particles generates produce 
scintillation light in sensitive 
layers 
scintillation light is 
collected optical fibers 
guided to photo detectors 
in this way, a threedimensional 
image shower is measured, 
allows to reconstruct direction 
energy hadrons 
also cherenkov effect allows 
to build complete detectors 
superkamiokande detector in japan 
consists a huge cylindrical tank, 
contains , 
tons ultra pure water 
a charged particle passes 
water speed beyond that 
speed light in water, is 
speed light in vacuum, 
a cone light is emitted 
this cone is intercepted an array 
photomultipliers distributed 
walls 
detect an ellipse photons, 
allows to reconstruct direction 
velocity particle 
lateral longitudinal segmentation 
allows to distinguish between hadrons 
particles, interact via 
electromagnetic force, like electrons 
photons, muons 
a general rule, 
one say that electromagnetic 
showers short, slim regular 
hadronic showers penetrating, 
wide, irregular 
different characteristics 
electromagnetic hadronic showers, 
often two calorimeters, 
a fine grain electromagnetic one 
a coarser hadron calorimeter 
is synergy between 
different detector types that 
allows to identify particles 
measure direction energy 
this is explained 
in optional video a, 
shows atlas 
detector lhc works 
in next video, we will show 
types particle detectors developed 
produced in laboratories
