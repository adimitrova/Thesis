[MUSIC].

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,611
In a 27 kilometer long tunnel buried
deep underground at the CERN laboratory,

3
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:22,456
the seven story high ATLAS detector
is designed to enable scientists to

4
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:26,190
study the conditions
of the early universe.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,880
In this episode,
we will see how ATLAS works.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,230
The detector consists of many components.

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,516
These are needed to measure the different
types of particles produced in

8
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,984
the collision which then
pass through ATLAS.

[MUSIC]

10
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:49,575
The intersections measure
the tracks of charged particles,

11
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:54,540
which are bent by the magnetic field of
a thin superconducting solenoidal magnet.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,665
Outside of all of these
are two calorimeter devices,

13
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,834
measuring the energies of particles.

00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:04,312
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:08,254
Finally, the muon spectrometer
measures the tracks of muons,

16
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:12,563
which are bent in the field of
the superconducting toroidal magnets.

17
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:18,255
[MUSIC]

18
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:21,629
Here's how ATLAS detects
different types of particles.

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,400
An electron will plow through the inner
detector, leaving a track behind

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,430
before finally stopping in
the electromagnetic calorimeter.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,812
A photon behaves in a similar way,
but leaves no track.

22
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:41,887
A proton leaves a track and interacts
primarily in the hadronic calorimeter.

00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,586
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:47,654
A neutron behaves in a similar way,
but leaves no track.

25
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:50,325
[MUSIC]

26
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:54,453
A muon passes all the way through ATLAS,
leaving tracks behind.

27
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:59,120
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,925
Finally, a neutrino passes through
ATLAS without being detected at all.

29
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:12,925
[MUSIC]

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,851
Billions of subatomic particles called
protons advance towards each other from

31
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,980
opposite directions at
almost the speed of light.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,391
[SOUND] As two protons collide,
hundreds of new

33
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:34,717
particles are formed from
the energy of the collision.

34
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:37,661
These collisions occur
a billion times a second.
