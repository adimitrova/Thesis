[music].
in a 27 kilometer long tunnel buried deep underground at the cern laboratory, the seven story high atlas detector is designed to enable scientists to study the conditions of the early universe.
in this episode, we will see how atlas works.
the detector consists of many components.
these are needed to measure the different types of particles produced in the collision which then pass through atlas.
[music] the intersections measure the tracks of charged particles, which are bent by the magnetic field of a thin superconducting solenoidal magnet.
outside of all of these are two calorimeter devices, measuring the energies of particles.
[music] finally, the muon spectrometer measures the tracks of muons, which are bent in the field of the superconducting toroidal magnets.
[music] here's how atlas detects different types of particles.
an electron will plow through the inner detector, leaving a track behind before finally stopping in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
a photon behaves in a similar way, but leaves no track.
a proton leaves a track and interacts primarily in the hadronic calorimeter.
[music] a neutron behaves in a similar way, but leaves no track.
[music] a muon passes all the way through atlas, leaving tracks behind.
[music] finally, a neutrino passes through atlas without being detected at all.
[music] billions of subatomic particles called protons advance towards each other from opposite directions at almost the speed of light.
[sound] as two protons collide, hundreds of new particles are formed from the energy of the collision.
these collisions occur a billion times a second.
