music 
in a kilometer long tunnel buried 
deep underground cern laboratory, 
seven story high atlas detector 
is designed to enable scientists to 
study conditions 
early universe 
in this episode, 
we will see atlas works 
detector consists many components 
needed to measure different 
types particles produced in 
collision 
pass atlas 
music 
intersections measure 
tracks charged particles, 
bent magnetic field 
a thin superconducting solenoidal magnet 
outside 
two calorimeter devices, 
measuring energies particles 
music 
finally, muon spectrometer 
measures tracks muons, 
bent in field 
superconducting toroidal magnets 
music 
heres atlas detects 
different types particles 
an electron will plow inner 
detector, leaving a track behind 
finally stopping in 
electromagnetic calorimeter 
a photon behaves in a similar way, 
leaves track 
a proton leaves a track interacts 
primarily in hadronic calorimeter 
music 
a neutron behaves in a similar way, 
leaves track 
music 
a muon passes way atlas, 
leaving tracks behind 
music 
finally, a neutrino passes 
atlas without detected 
music 
billions subatomic particles called 
protons advance towards 
opposite directions 
almost speed light 
sound two protons collide, 
hundreds new 
particles formed 
energy collision 
collisions occur 
a billion times a second
