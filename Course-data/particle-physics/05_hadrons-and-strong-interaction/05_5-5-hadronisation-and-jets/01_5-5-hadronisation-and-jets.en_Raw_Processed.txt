in this fifth module we discussing 
internal structure hadrons 
strong interactions 
this fifth video will 
examine consequences 
fact that strong interactions 
become stronger distance 
watched this video, you will 
understand one cannot observe free 
quarks, happens quark, 
antiquark pair is created in vacuo 
enormous amount 
energy stored in a color field large 
distances, separated color charges will 
create additional particles instead 
becoming free quarks gluons 
a dynamic separation occurs, 
example, in e e annihilation 
quark antiquark pairs 
high energy far threshold 
left figure shows feynman diagram, 
right figure, 
kinematics in 
centerofmass frame 
central figure is an example 
an event this kind showing multiple 
hadrons in final state 
again, there two approaches 
to qualitatively understand 
process hadron 
formation in final state 
a chromostatic one 
a chromodynamic approach 
in a chromostatic approach, 
quarkantiquark pair 
creates quark antiquark 
pairs soon original pair is 
separated order fm 
this distance, stored field 
energy is large enough to this 
this process continues until 
relative momentum quarks is 
sufficiently moderated to permit 
formation bound states 
hadron formation occurs along strings, 
a kind elastic 
band connecting two color charges thus 
limited transverse momentum 
hadrons thus form jets 
approximately follow initial direction 
quark antiquark 
in a chromodynamic approach, 
process visualized 
in terms a quarkgluon cascade 
starts emission 
a gluon quark, 
antiquark shown 
in this feynman diagram 
this gluon produce either 
a quark antiquark pair, 
a pair gluons, according to 
elementary vertices qcd 
there gluons quarks, 
splitting gluons is probable, 
is thus shown in this feynman graph 
strong coupling 
will become larger, 
invariant mass q 
virtual particles involved diminishes 
end cascade, quarks 
will form colorless bound states 
is clear that this 
approach cannot used 
to end 
hadronization process 
small q squared, coupling constant 
becomes so large that a perturbative 
expansion in powers coupling 
constant will longer converge 
in this domain, 
collective effects take end 
formation mesons baryons 
must described 
phenomenological models 
hadrons formed in vacuo 
end quark gluon cascade 
transverse momenta respect 
to original quark direction thus 
limited heisenbergs 
principle to mev 
hadrons thus concentrated around 
initial quark direction form jets 
transverse momentum is small, 
independent quark momentum 
thus, jets become 
collimated quark energy increases 
if first gluon emitted in 
cascade sufficient 
transverse momentum respect 
to natural width a jet, 
a third hadron jet will become 
visible along gluon direction 
one thus observes an event 
three jets shown in this example 
events attributed to 
reaction e e q qbar gluon 
cross section this process 
e e q qbar gluon 
is calculated using feynman 
diagrams shown left 
gluon emission a quark 
characteristics 
a bremsstrahlung process 
amplitude two divergences, 
becomes large 
emission a lowenergy gluon, 
is an infrared divergence 
also blows a forward 
emission a collinear divergence 
in cases, quark 
gluon jets will merge 
two well three jet events 
counted among hadronic final states 
in calculation we must thus add 
cross section to obtain total hadronic 
cross section introduced in video 
one thus obtains a better approximation 
ratio r high energies in better 
agreement experimental data 
shown right this graph 
jets appear without exception 
whenever a high energy quark 
gluon converts hadrons 
this means, first all, 
that probability 
hadronization process is 
is an inevitable process 
second, conservation 
energymomentum 
limitation transverse momentum 
heisenbergs principle means that 
jets follow direction represent 
energy initial quark gluon 
this narrow 
collimation energy increases 
this event shows a final 
state two energetic jets 
produced in a protonproton 
collision lhc 
top you see a zoom inner 
detector calorimeters 
left, you see multiple vertices 
high luminosity collider 
causes multiple reactions 
bunch crossing 
two reactions 
deposited energy, colored in red 
green, show back to back jets 
strongly collimated 
bottom image right shows 
a histogram directional 
distribution energy 
two narrow peaks correspond to 
direction energy two jets 
this concludes short 
discussion strong interactions 
in next module, we will deal weak 
interactions higgs mechanism
