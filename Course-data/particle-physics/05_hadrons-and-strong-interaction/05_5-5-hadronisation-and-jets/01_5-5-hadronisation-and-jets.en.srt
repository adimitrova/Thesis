2
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:15,139
In this fifth module we are discussing
the internal structure of hadrons and

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,390
strong interactions.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,290
This fifth video will
examine the consequences

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,430
of the fact that strong interactions
become stronger with distance.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,863
After having watched this video, you will
understand why one cannot observe free

7
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:33,115
quarks, and what happens when the quark,
antiquark pair is created in vacuo.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,237
Because of the enormous amount of
energy stored in a color field at large

9
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:45,029
distances, separated color charges will
create additional particles instead

10
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,093
of becoming free quarks or gluons.

11
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:53,057
A dynamic separation occurs, for
example, in the e+ e- annihilation

12
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:58,356
into quark antiquark pairs at
high energy far above threshold.

13
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:01,754
The left figure shows the Feynman diagram,
the right figure,

14
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:04,136
the kinematics in
the center-of-mass frame.

15
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:08,120
The central figure is an example of
an event of this kind showing multiple

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,700
hadrons in the final state.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,970
Again, there are two approaches
to qualitatively understand

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,090
the process of hadron
formation in the final state.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,346
a chromostatic one and
a more chromodynamic approach.

20
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:24,190
In a chromostatic approach,

21
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,210
the quark-antiquark pair
creates further quark antiquark

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,230
pairs as soon as the original pair is
separated by of the order of 1 fm.

23
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,250
At this distance, the stored field
energy is large enough to do this.

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,240
This process continues until
the relative momentum of the quarks is

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,092
sufficiently moderated to permit
the formation of bound states.

26
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:49,750
Hadron formation occurs along strings,
a kind of elastic

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,390
band connecting two color charges thus
with limited transverse momentum.

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,384
The hadrons thus form jets which
approximately follow the initial direction

29
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:01,470
of the quark and the antiquark.

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,390
In a more chromodynamic approach,

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,041
the process can be visualized
in terms of a quark-gluon cascade.

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,870
It starts with the emission
of a gluon by the quark, or

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,550
the antiquark as shown
in this Feynman diagram.

34
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,200
This gluon can produce either
a quark antiquark pair, or

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,280
a pair of gluons, according to
the elementary vertices of QCD.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,760
Because there are more gluons than quarks,
splitting into gluons is more probable,

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,780
and is thus shown in this Feynman graph.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,610
The strong coupling
will become the larger,

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,989
the more the invariant mass q^2 of
the virtual particles involved diminishes.

40
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,740
At the end of the cascade, the quarks
will form colorless bound states.

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,430
It is clear that this
approach cannot be used

42
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,990
up to the end of
the hadronization process.

43
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,620
At small q squared, the coupling constant
becomes so large that a perturbative

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,240
expansion in powers of the coupling
constant will no longer converge.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,220
In this domain,

46
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,530
collective effects take over which end up
by the formation of mesons and baryons.

47
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,812
They must be described by
more phenomenological models.

48
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:19,188
The hadrons are formed in vacuo at
the end of the quark gluon cascade.

49
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:22,959
Their transverse momenta with respect
to the original quark direction are thus

50
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,720
limited by Heisenberg's
principle to some 300 MeV.

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,370
Hadrons are thus concentrated around
the initial quark direction and form jets.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,330
Their transverse momentum is small,
and independent of the quark momentum.

53
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,280
Thus, jets become more and more
collimated as the quark energy increases.

54
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,220
If the first gluon emitted in
the cascade has sufficient

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,070
transverse momentum with respect
to the natural width of a jet,

56
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,980
a third hadron jet will become
visible along the gluon direction.

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,460
One thus observes an event with
three jets as shown in this example.

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,741
These events can be attributed to
the reaction e+ e- -> q qbar gluon.

59
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:08,902
The cross section for this process
e+ e- -> q qbar gluon

60
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:13,500
is calculated using the Feynman
diagrams as shown on the left.

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,230
The gluon emission from a quark
has all the characteristics of

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,130
a Bremsstrahlung process.

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,450
Its amplitude has two divergences,
becomes very large for

64
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,690
the emission of a low-energy gluon,
which is an infrared divergence.

65
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,610
It also blows up for a very forward
emission by a collinear divergence.

66
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,670
In both cases, the quark and
gluon jets will merge.

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,470
Two as well as three jet events are
counted among the hadronic final states.

68
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,441
In the calculation we must thus add their
cross section to obtain the total hadronic

69
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:49,161
cross section introduced in video 4.5.

70
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:54,245
One thus obtains a better approximation
for the ratio R at high energies in better

71
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:58,900
agreement with the experimental data
as shown on the right of this graph.

72
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,562
Jets appear without exception
whenever a high energy quark or

73
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,436
gluon converts into hadrons.

74
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,096
This means, first of all,
that the probability for

75
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,100
the hadronization process is 1.

76
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,170
It is an inevitable process.

77
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,690
Second, the conservation
of energy-momentum and

78
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,020
the limitation of transverse momentum
by Heisenberg's principle means that

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,050
jets follow the direction and represent
the energy of the initial quark or gluon.

80
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,277
And this with the more and more narrow
collimation as the energy increases.

81
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:36,320
This event shows a final
state with two energetic jets

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,770
produced in a proton-proton
collision at the LHC.

83
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,267
On the top you see a zoom of the inner
detector and the calorimeters.

84
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,890
On the left, you see multiple vertices.

85
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,500
The high luminosity of the collider
causes multiple reactions at the same

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,140
bunch crossing.

87
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,430
The two reactions with most of the
deposited energy, which are colored in red

88
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,135
and green, show back to back jets
which are strongly collimated.

89
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:05,740
The bottom image on the right shows
a histogram of the directional

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,300
distribution of energy.

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,940
The two narrow peaks correspond to the
direction and the energy of the two jets.

92
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,590
This concludes our short
discussion of strong interactions.

93
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,381
In the next module, we will deal with weak
interactions and the Higgs mechanism.

94
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:26,334
