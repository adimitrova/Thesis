in this fifth module we discussing 
structure hadrons 
strong interactions 
in this second video we discuss 
inelastic scattering between electrons 
nucleons one learn that 
following this video, 
you will know resonances 
excited states nucleons 
dee inelastic scattering 
nucleon structure functions 
socalled scaling 
hypothesis evidence 
substructures inside nucleon, 
well role 
distribution quarks in nucleon 
form factors decrease rapidly 
q like we showed in video 
consequently, probability 
to observe an elastic scattering 
becomes low high energymomentum transfer 
this is surprising 
large q corresponds to 
a short photon wavelength, 
is 
able to resolve internal 
structure target particle 
this structure will 
insensitive to energymomentum 
transfer 
target will excited 
even destroyed 
in words, 
inelastic processes take 
moderate q, inelastic 
processes produce excited states 
nucleon, also called 
resonances, , 
quantum 
numbers proton 
resonances an extremely 
short lifetime 
therefore a broad mass distribution 
figure show result an 
electronproton scattering experiment 
an energy gev 
fixed scattering angle 
elasticity reaction 
is first visible in 
energy distribution 
outgoing electron left, 
is longer fixed 
in elastic case 
broader secondary maxima formed 
corresponded to excited states 
nucleon, 
also clearly visible in invariant 
mass distribution outgoing 
hadronic state right 
is kinematic is completely 
determined measuring outgoing 
electron in case 
elastic scattering 
position inverse width 
large maximum indicate mass 
life time resonance 
higher q, beyond resonance region we 
enter region 
socalled 
deep elastic scattering 
final state consists multiple 
hadrons least one baryon to 
to conserve quantum numbers 
this is region 
photon interacts 
individually charged 
constituents nucleon 
cross section parametrized 
terms before, 
unknown structure function w 
w replacing form factors 
parametrize distribution 
dynamics nucleon constituents 
depend tranfered 
energy nu is energy 
photon invariant mass squared 
kinematics requires a second 
additional kinematic parameter 
mass hadronic 
system is longer fixed, 
case a proton 
resonance in final state 
in addition to scattering we 
thus choose a second variable 
here is energy e 
outgoing electron 
structure functions measured 
experimentally, analyzing dependence 
cross section scattering 
angle, like in elastic case 
big discovery slac in late 
that structure functions 
depend nu 
q separately ratio xbj, 
is equal to q twice 
mass proton times nu 
variable is named 
inventor james d bjorken 
phenomenon called scaling that 
time general observation 
that dimensionless variable xbj 
depend energy mass scale 
structure functions follow in fact 
scaling if inside nucleon there exist 
substructures 
photon interacts elastically 
this interpretation scaling is 
best demonstrated in limit 
large equal square, 
interaction between quarks 
is negligible compared to force 
transmitted photon 
quarks act quasi free particles 
photon interacts 
in an incoherent manner 
to respect kinematic 
constraint in an elastic 
electronquark scattering, 
photon interact 
a quark carries a fraction 
xbj nucleon momentum 
consequently, cross section is 
proportional to probability 
to find a quark in nucleon 
in limit square going to infinity, 
structure functions wi 
tend toward function fix 
directly 
related to distribution 
fractional momentum xi 
carried quarks type i 
experiment slac in fact shown that 
phenomenon already occurs moderate squared 
structure function w, 
a function kinematical 
variable omega, 
is equal to xbj, 
smoothens increasing q 
beyond resonance region, 
follows a universal function 
xbj independent q 
kinematic constraint imposed 
elastic scattering 
pointlike particles inside 
proton is indeed respected 
however, scaling 
structure functions is exact 
this figure show modern measurements 
that come experiments 
electron proton collider hera 
curves data different x 
expressed a constant 
in order to visible 
in graph 
small x, 
so small quark momenta, 
structure function varies 
strongly q 
contributions virtual gluons 
enriching quark contents 
smaller deviation 
large x subtle 
coupling constant 
strong interactions 
depends momentum transfer 
is really a constant 
we will come back to this 
astonishing fact in video 
structure functions thus used to 
measure momentum distribution 
quarks inside nucleons 
we qualitatively demonstrate behavior 
structure function fx based 
successively refined 
hypotheses dynamics quarks 
if nucleon consisted three 
quarks without interaction, 
x will fixed to quark, 
f will a delta function this value 
if a state 
quarks bound together 
via gluons, 
average value x would still , 
a wider distribution 
around this value 
if we finally take 
account that quarks emit 
virtual gluons split 
a quarkantiquark pair low energy, 
we expect that quark distribution 
tends to fill x 
experimental data indeed to 
follow this qualitative picture 
first valence quarks, 
that is two quarks 
one quark proton, 
structure function varies around 
a strong enhancement 
small x additional quarkantiquark 
pairs produced gluons 
integral distribution 
is twice large 
quark 
quark, 
contribution gluons is indeed 
seen in contribution 
sbar quarks would 
present in nucleon otherwise 
integrating this distribution we 
see that 
proton momentum is carried quarks 
rest is carried gluons 
in next video, we discuss mesons, 
bound states between quarks antiquarks
