2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,008
In this fifth module we are discussing
the structure of hadrons and

3
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,461
strong interactions.

4
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:21,502
In this second video we discuss
inelastic scattering between electrons and

5
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:25,210
nucleons and what one can learn from that.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,580
After following this video,

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,960
you will know about resonances
as excited states of nucleons.

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,370
Dee inelastic scattering and
nucleon structure functions.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,850
And the so.called scaling
hypothesis as evidence for

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,870
substructures inside the nucleon,

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,670
as well as the role and
distribution of quarks in the nucleon.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,372
Form factors decrease rapidly with
q^2 like we showed in video 5.1.

13
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:57,460
Consequently, the probability

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,800
to observe an elastic scattering
becomes low at high energy-momentum transfer.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,240
This is not surprising.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,090
Large q^2 corresponds to
a short photon wavelength,

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,260
which is then more and

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,310
more able to resolve the internal
structure of the target particle.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
This structure will then not be
insensitive to the energy-momentum

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,140
transfer.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,850
The target will be excited or
even destroyed.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,670
In other words,
inelastic processes take over.

23
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,350
At the moderate q^2, inelastic
processes produce excited states of

24
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,770
the nucleon, also called
resonances, such as ∆+,

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,802
which have the same quantum
numbers as the proton.

26
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:45,220
These resonances an extremely
short lifetime and

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,600
therefore a broad mass distribution.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,400
The figure show the result of an
electron-proton scattering experiment at

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,823
an energy of about 3 GeV and
at fixed scattering angle.

30
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:03,210
The elasticity of the reaction
is first visible in

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,930
the energy distribution of
the outgoing electron on the left,

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,068
which is no longer fixed
as in elastic case.

33
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,940
Broader secondary maxima are formed
which corresponded to the excited states

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,967
of the nucleon,

35
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:20,588
also clearly visible in the invariant
mass distribution of the outgoing

36
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,690
hadronic state on the right.

37
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,225
Is kinematic is completely
determined by measuring the outgoing

38
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:33,638
electron as in the case
of elastic scattering.

39
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:41,066
The position and the inverse width of
the large maximum indicate the mass and

40
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:46,702
the life time of the resonance
∆+(1236).

41
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:49,380
At higher q^2, beyond the resonance region we
enter into the region

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,540
of the so-called
deep elastic scattering.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,040
The final state consists of multiple
hadrons with at least one baryon to

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,160
to conserve quantum numbers.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,140
This is the region where
the photon interacts

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,880
individually with the charged
constituents of the nucleon.

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,480
The cross section can be parametrized
with 2 terms as before, but

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,890
with 2 unknown structure function W_1 and
W_2 replacing the form factors.

49
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,400
They parametrize the distribution and

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,130
dynamics of the nucleon constituents.
They depend on the tranfered

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,292
energy nu which is the energy of the
photon and its invariant mass squared.

52
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:36,370
The kinematics now requires a second
additional kinematic parameter

53
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,390
because the mass of the hadronic
system is no longer fixed,

54
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,170
as was the case with a proton or
resonance in the final state.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,350
In addition to the scattering we can
thus choose a second variable.

56
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,370
Here it is the energy E’
of the outgoing electron.

57
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,260
The structure functions are measured
experimentally, analyzing the dependence

58
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,680
of the cross section on the scattering
angle, like in the elastic case.

59
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,380
The big discovery at SLAC in the late
60s was that the structure functions

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,110
do not depend on nu and
q^2 separately but on their ratio x_Bj,

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:25,295
which is equal to q^2 over twice
the mass of the proton times nu.

62
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:30,030
The variable is named after
its inventor James D. Bjorken.

63
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,670
The phenomenon was called scaling at that
time because of the very general observation

64
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:41,260
that the dimensionless variable x_Bj does
not depend on any energy nor mass scale.

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,904
Structure functions follow in fact
scaling if inside the nucleon there exist

66
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:50,910
sub-structures with which
the photon interacts elastically.

67
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,585
This interpretation of scaling is
best demonstrated in the limit of

68
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,230
large equal square,

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,770
where the interaction between quarks
is negligible compared to the force

70
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,050
transmitted by the photon.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,735
Quarks then act as quasi free particles

72
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:10,390
with which the photon interacts
in an incoherent manner.

73
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,060
To respect the kinematic
constraint in such an elastic

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,680
electron-quark scattering,
the photon can only interact with

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,680
a quark which carries a fraction
x_Bj of the nucleon momentum.

76
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,470
Consequently, the cross section is
proportional to the probability

77
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,638
to find such a quark in the nucleon.

78
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:36,317
In the limit of square going to infinity,

79
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:41,782
the structure functions W_i
tend toward the function F_i(x)

80
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:46,722
which are directly
related to the distribution of

81
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:51,906
the fractional momentum x_i
carried by quarks of type i.

82
00:05:51,906 --> 00:06:00,580
The experiment at SLAC have in fact shown that the 
phenomenon already occurs at the moderate squared.

83
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,178
The structure function W_2,
as a function of the kinematical

84
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:12,060
variable omega,
which is about equal to 1/x_Bj,

85
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,510
smoothens with increasing the q^2
beyond the resonance region,

86
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,805
and then follows a universal function
of x_Bj independent of q^2.

87
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:26,530
The kinematic constraint imposed
by elastic scattering of

88
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,610
point-like particles inside
the proton is indeed respected.

89
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,200
However, the scaling of
structure functions is not exact.

90
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,560
This figure show modern measurements
that come from experiments at

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,953
the electron proton collider HERA.

92
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:48,460
The curves and data for different x
are expressed by a constant

93
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,790
in order to be all visible
in the same graph.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,060
At small x,

95
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,320
so at small quark momenta,

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,270
the structure function varies
strongly with q^2 because of

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,540
the contributions from virtual gluons
enriching the quark contents.

98
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,950
The smaller deviation at
large x are more subtle.

99
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,460
The coupling constant
of strong interactions

100
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,630
depends on the momentum transfer.

101
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,665
It is not really a constant.

102
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:23,790
We will come back to this
astonishing fact in video 5.4.

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,330
Structure functions can thus be used to
measure the momentum distribution of

104
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,846
quarks inside nucleons.

105
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:40,040
We qualitatively demonstrate the behavior of 
the structure function F_2(x) based on 

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,210
successively refined
hypotheses on the dynamics of quarks.

107
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,720
If the nucleon consisted of three
quarks without interaction,

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,430
x will be fixed to 1/3 for each quark, and

109
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,690
F_2 will be a delta function at this value.

110
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,920
If it were a state where
quarks are bound together

111
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,530
via gluons,
the average value of x would still be 1/3,

112
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,230
but with a wider distribution
around this value.

113
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,320
If we finally take into
account that quarks can emit

114
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,220
virtual gluons which can split
into a quark-antiquark pair at low energy,

115
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,046
we expect that the quark distribution
tends to fill up at x -> 0.

116
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:33,980
The experimental data indeed to
follow this qualitative picture.

117
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,180
First of all for the valence quarks,
that is the two up quarks and

118
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,210
one down quark for the proton,

119
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,427
the structure function varies around
1/3 with a strong enhancement

120
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:50,748
at small x by additional quark-antiquark 
pairs produced by gluons.

121
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:54,544
The integral of the distribution
is twice as large for

122
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:58,260
the up quark than for
the down quark, as it should be.

123
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,332
The contribution gluons of is indeed
seen in the contribution of s and

124
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:08,930
sbar quarks which would not be
present in the nucleon otherwise.

125
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,330
When integrating this distribution we
see that only about 1/2 of

126
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,756
the proton momentum is carried by quarks.

127
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,590
The rest is carried by gluons.

128
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,513
In the next video, we discuss mesons,
bound states between quarks and antiquarks.
