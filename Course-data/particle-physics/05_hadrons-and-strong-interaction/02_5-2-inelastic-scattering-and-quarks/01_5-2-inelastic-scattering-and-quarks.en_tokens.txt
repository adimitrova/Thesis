in
this
fifth
module
we
are
discussing
the
structure
of
hadrons
and
strong
interactions
.
in
this
second
video
we
discuss
inelastic
scattering
between
electrons
and
nucleons
and
what
one
can
learn
from
that
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
about
resonances
as
excited
states
of
nucleons
.
dee
inelastic
scattering
and
nucleon
structure
functions
.
and
the
so.called
scaling
hypothesis
as
evidence
for
substructures
inside
the
nucleon
,
as
well
as
the
role
and
distribution
of
quarks
in
the
nucleon
.
form
factors
decrease
rapidly
with
q^2
like
we
showed
in
video
5.1.
consequently
,
the
probability
to
observe
an
elastic
scattering
becomes
low
at
high
energy-momentum
transfer
.
this
is
not
surprising
.
large
q^2
corresponds
to
a
short
photon
wavelength
,
which
is
then
more
and
more
able
to
resolve
the
internal
structure
of
the
target
particle
.
this
structure
will
then
not
be
insensitive
to
the
energy-momentum
transfer
.
the
target
will
be
excited
or
even
destroyed
.
in
other
words
,
inelastic
processes
take
over
.
at
the
moderate
q^2
,
inelastic
processes
produce
excited
states
of
the
nucleon
,
also
called
resonances
,
such
as
Ã¢ÂÂ+
,
which
have
the
same
quantum
numbers
as
the
proton
.
these
resonances
an
extremely
short
lifetime
and
therefore
a
broad
mass
distribution
.
the
figure
show
the
result
of
an
electron-proton
scattering
experiment
at
an
energy
of
about
3
gev
and
at
fixed
scattering
angle
.
the
elasticity
of
the
reaction
is
first
visible
in
the
energy
distribution
of
the
outgoing
electron
on
the
left
,
which
is
no
longer
fixed
as
in
elastic
case
.
broader
secondary
maxima
are
formed
which
corresponded
to
the
excited
states
of
the
nucleon
,
also
clearly
visible
in
the
invariant
mass
distribution
of
the
outgoing
hadronic
state
on
the
right
.
is
kinematic
is
completely
determined
by
measuring
the
outgoing
electron
as
in
the
case
of
elastic
scattering
.
the
position
and
the
inverse
width
of
the
large
maximum
indicate
the
mass
and
the
life
time
of
the
resonance
Ã¢ÂÂ+
(
1236
)
.
at
higher
q^2
,
beyond
the
resonance
region
we
enter
into
the
region
of
the
so-called
deep
elastic
scattering
.
the
final
state
consists
of
multiple
hadrons
with
at
least
one
baryon
to
to
conserve
quantum
numbers
.
this
is
the
region
where
the
photon
interacts
individually
with
the
charged
constituents
of
the
nucleon
.
the
cross
section
can
be
parametrized
with
2
terms
as
before
,
but
with
2
unknown
structure
function
w_1
and
w_2
replacing
the
form
factors
.
they
parametrize
the
distribution
and
dynamics
of
the
nucleon
constituents
.
they
depend
on
the
tranfered
energy
nu
which
is
the
energy
of
the
photon
and
its
invariant
mass
squared
.
the
kinematics
now
requires
a
second
additional
kinematic
parameter
because
the
mass
of
the
hadronic
system
is
no
longer
fixed
,
as
was
the
case
with
a
proton
or
resonance
in
the
final
state
.
in
addition
to
the
scattering
we
can
thus
choose
a
second
variable
.
here
it
is
the
energy
eÃ¢ÂÂ
of
the
outgoing
electron
.
the
structure
functions
are
measured
experimentally
,
analyzing
the
dependence
of
the
cross
section
on
the
scattering
angle
,
like
in
the
elastic
case
.
the
big
discovery
at
slac
in
the
late
60s
was
that
the
structure
functions
do
not
depend
on
nu
and
q^2
separately
but
on
their
ratio
x_bj
,
which
is
equal
to
q^2
over
twice
the
mass
of
the
proton
times
nu
.
the
variable
is
named
after
its
inventor
james
d.
bjorken
.
the
phenomenon
was
called
scaling
at
that
time
because
of
the
very
general
observation
that
the
dimensionless
variable
x_bj
does
not
depend
on
any
energy
nor
mass
scale
.
structure
functions
follow
in
fact
scaling
if
inside
the
nucleon
there
exist
sub-structures
with
which
the
photon
interacts
elastically
.
this
interpretation
of
scaling
is
best
demonstrated
in
the
limit
of
large
equal
square
,
where
the
interaction
between
quarks
is
negligible
compared
to
the
force
transmitted
by
the
photon
.
quarks
then
act
as
quasi
free
particles
with
which
the
photon
interacts
in
an
incoherent
manner
.
to
respect
the
kinematic
constraint
in
such
an
elastic
electron-quark
scattering
,
the
photon
can
only
interact
with
a
quark
which
carries
a
fraction
x_bj
of
the
nucleon
momentum
.
consequently
,
the
cross
section
is
proportional
to
the
probability
to
find
such
a
quark
in
the
nucleon
.
in
the
limit
of
square
going
to
infinity
,
the
structure
functions
w_i
tend
toward
the
function
f_i
(
x
)
which
are
directly
related
to
the
distribution
of
the
fractional
momentum
x_i
carried
by
quarks
of
type
i.
the
experiment
at
slac
have
in
fact
shown
that
the
phenomenon
already
occurs
at
the
moderate
squared
.
the
structure
function
w_2
,
as
a
function
of
the
kinematical
variable
omega
,
which
is
about
equal
to
1/x_bj
,
smoothens
with
increasing
the
q^2
beyond
the
resonance
region
,
and
then
follows
a
universal
function
of
x_bj
independent
of
q^2
.
the
kinematic
constraint
imposed
by
elastic
scattering
of
point-like
particles
inside
the
proton
is
indeed
respected
.
however
,
the
scaling
of
structure
functions
is
not
exact
.
this
figure
show
modern
measurements
that
come
from
experiments
at
the
electron
proton
collider
hera
.
the
curves
and
data
for
different
x
are
expressed
by
a
constant
in
order
to
be
all
visible
in
the
same
graph
.
at
small
x
,
so
at
small
quark
momenta
,
the
structure
function
varies
strongly
with
q^2
because
of
the
contributions
from
virtual
gluons
enriching
the
quark
contents
.
the
smaller
deviation
at
large
x
are
more
subtle
.
the
coupling
constant
of
strong
interactions
depends
on
the
momentum
transfer
.
it
is
not
really
a
constant
.
we
will
come
back
to
this
astonishing
fact
in
video
5.4.
structure
functions
can
thus
be
used
to
measure
the
momentum
distribution
of
quarks
inside
nucleons
.
we
qualitatively
demonstrate
the
behavior
of
the
structure
function
f_2
(
x
)
based
on
successively
refined
hypotheses
on
the
dynamics
of
quarks
.
if
the
nucleon
consisted
of
three
quarks
without
interaction
,
x
will
be
fixed
to
1/3
for
each
quark
,
and
f_2
will
be
a
delta
function
at
this
value
.
if
it
were
a
state
where
quarks
are
bound
together
via
gluons
,
the
average
value
of
x
would
still
be
1/3
,
but
with
a
wider
distribution
around
this
value
.
if
we
finally
take
into
account
that
quarks
can
emit
virtual
gluons
which
can
split
into
a
quark-antiquark
pair
at
low
energy
,
we
expect
that
the
quark
distribution
tends
to
fill
up
at
x
-
>
0.
the
experimental
data
indeed
to
follow
this
qualitative
picture
.
first
of
all
for
the
valence
quarks
,
that
is
the
two
up
quarks
and
one
down
quark
for
the
proton
,
the
structure
function
varies
around
1/3
with
a
strong
enhancement
at
small
x
by
additional
quark-antiquark
pairs
produced
by
gluons
.
the
integral
of
the
distribution
is
twice
as
large
for
the
up
quark
than
for
the
down
quark
,
as
it
should
be
.
the
contribution
gluons
of
is
indeed
seen
in
the
contribution
of
s
and
sbar
quarks
which
would
not
be
present
in
the
nucleon
otherwise
.
when
integrating
this
distribution
we
see
that
only
about
1/2
of
the
proton
momentum
is
carried
by
quarks
.
the
rest
is
carried
by
gluons
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
discuss
mesons
,
bound
states
between
quarks
and
antiquarks
.
