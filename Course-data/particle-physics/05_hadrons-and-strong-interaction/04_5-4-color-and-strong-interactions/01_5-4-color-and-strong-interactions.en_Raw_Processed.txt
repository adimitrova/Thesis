in this fifth module, discussing 
structure hadrons 
strong interaction 
weve seen several times that strong 
interactions special properties 
quarks behave almost free particles 
short distances inside hadrons 
nonetheless, free quarks 
never observed outside hadrons 
this indicates that strong force 
confines within bound states 
allow to separate 
to large distances 
in this fourth video well 
qualitatively discuss 
seemingly incompatible properties 
following this video, you will 
know main properties strong 
interactions, including different 
vertices in feynman diagrams, 
color charge, gluons 
role in binding quarks together, 
vacuum polarization electromagnetic 
strong interactions 
we already introduced 
components color charge 
in video 
a quantum number quarks 
we also saw immediate consequence 
to triple cross section 
e e annihilation 
hadrons in video 
color is quark property responsible 
strong interaction 
formal theory this interaction is 
quantum chromodynamics, also called qcd 
color take three different values, 
red, blue, green quarks 
we indicate a lower index appropriate 
a quark carry one non zero color, 
antiquarks carry one anticolor 
interaction between quarks proceeds 
exchange color 
intermediate vector bosons transmitting 
strong force eight gluons, g 
carry a color an anticolor, 
therefore color neutral 
this is in contrast to photon couples 
to electromagnetic charge 
carry one 
strong interaction, 
there eight gluons in total 
three colors 
three anticolors one would expect 
a total nine combinations 
one them, fully symmetric combination, 
that is 
redantired plus greenantigreen plus 
blueantiblue, 
net color, 
participate in strong interaction 
so cannot produced 
remaining eight gluons 
vector bosons, 
electromagnetically neutral

so there is invariance 
an overall rotation in color space 
according to noethers theorem, this 
requires a conservation law colors

if gluons carry color, 
able to

carry even color anti 
color, there two additional vertices

gluons constantly exchanged 
between quarks to maintain binding, 
changing color quarks, 
in this sketch, 
while keeping overall hadron white 
mechanism works 
inside baryons 
between hadrons, example in a nucleus, 
objects neutral color 
exchanged to create binding, 
except short distances 
follows that an ab initio description 
nuclear force stays difficult, 
although we dispose 
a wellestablished quantum theory 
interaction between quarks gluons, 
namely qcd 
short distances, 
comparable to hadron size, 
exchange gluons produces 
a potential between quark antiquark 
is similar to one established 
photons in a positronium bound state 
this potential varies distance 
r like coulomb potential 
large distances, 
there is a different behavior, 
potential becomes 
larger distance 
we already saw a potential that fits 
description spectra jpsi 
upsilon states in video 
second term determines behavior 
long range potential 
a constant k equal to 
gevfm 
this corresponds to a constant 
long distance force 
equivalent to one required 
to lift a weight tons 
second term is created 
interaction between gluons 
in terms a chromostatic language, 
additional force between gluons 
concentrates color field 
along a corridor that connects 
two color charges 
particular 
shape field, 
one also call this a string 
that connects colors 
potential proportional to 
k times r allow color 
anticolor to separated, 
confines to distances

to generated dynamically

q must taken account 
we will talk this 
effect in a moment 
calculation techniques considerably 
simplified if one replaces 
spacetime continuum a mesh 
equidistant discrete points, 
similar to a crystal lattice sides a 
one defines quark fields 
sites lattice, 
gluon fields links 
continuum spacetime is recovered 
in limit an infinitely large lattice 
a 
this discretization introduces 
a lower limit momentumtransfer 
order a, 
thus regularizes divergences 
inherent to pertulative qcd 
numerical calculations this kind 
require tremendous computing resources 
performed 
powerful supercomputers 
this nonperturbative method, 
one arrives, fo 
example, results

calculated masses average 
different particle types

xi reference 
this results in a pretty 
impressive understanding 
hadron spectrum, suggesting that 
qcd is indeed a correct theory 
strong interaction also 
larger distances 
distance laws 
electromagnetic 
strong interaction fundamentally different 
electromagnetic potential decreases 
r a function distance 
strong potential increases 
long distances proportional to r 
to understand this difference, 
we must consider quantum correction 
to photon to gluon propagators 
a significant correction to photon propagator 
is one introduces 
an electronpositron loop 
this loop creates additional electric 
charges between projectile target 
we call this phenomenon 
vacuum polarization 
in electrostatic language we 
say that additional 
charges screen target charge 
therefore effective charge 
decreases distance 
that is, increases 
growing momentum transfer q 
this is, indeed, 
we find experimentally 
electrodynamics, 
this is a small effect 
to see a change alpha a few percent, 
we to compare momentum 
transfer almost zero that 
is large distances, 
alpha is measured 
to 
see example penning 
trap in video 
to energy large electron 
positron collider cern, 
momentum transfer q 
is around gev 
that is short distances 
strong interactions, effect 
vacuum polarisation is much 
pronounced size 
strong coupling, vacuum polarization 
change in net charge 
distance important 
in addition, 
sign effect is reversed 
strong force becomes 
stronger distance 
this is there two types 
vacuum polarization graphs gluons 
analogue electromagnetic 
polarization introduces quarkantiquark 
loops in gluon propagator 
shield colors charge 
in addition, 
coupling gluons between 
introduces gluon loops 
opposite sign 
in chromostatic language, 
we say that gluon loops 
introduce additional coloranticolor 
charges attractive 
this reinforces color charge 
target instead shielding 
large number gluons, 
zero mass, gluon loops dominate 
strong vacuum polarization 
consequently, color charge 
target increases 
distance proportional to inverse 
momentum transfer 
indeed one experimentally 
finds that this effect is 
significant 
electromagnetic counterpart 
in next video we will see 
properties strong 
interaction keep us 
seeing free quarks
