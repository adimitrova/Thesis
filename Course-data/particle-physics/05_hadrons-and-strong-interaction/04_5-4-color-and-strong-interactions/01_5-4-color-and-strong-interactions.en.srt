2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,981
In this fifth module, we're discussing
the structure of hadrons and

3
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,470
the strong interaction.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,250
We've seen several times that the strong
interactions have special properties.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,860
Quarks behave as almost as free particles
at short distances inside the hadrons.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,640
Nonetheless, free quarks have
never been observed outside hadrons.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,750
This indicates that the strong force
confines them within bound states and

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,100
does not allow to separate
them to large distances.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,050
In this fourth video we’ll
qualitatively discuss

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,490
these seemingly incompatible properties.

11
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,560
After following this video, you will
know the main properties of strong

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,360
interactions, including its different
vertices in Feynman diagrams,

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,077
color charge, gluons and
their role in binding quarks together, and

14
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:11,700
vacuum polarization for electromagnetic 
and strong interactions.

15
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,780
We already introduced
the 3 components of color charge

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,700
in video 1.1 as
a quantum number of quarks.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,670
We also saw the immediate consequence
to triple the cross section for

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,927
e+ e- annihilation 
into hadrons in video 4.5.

19
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:37,530
Color is the quark property responsible
for their strong interaction.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,610
The formal theory of this interaction is
quantum chromodynamics, also called QCD.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,170
Color can take three different values,
red, blue, and green for quarks.

22
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,630
We indicate it by a lower index when appropriate.

23
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,680
A quark can carry only one non zero color,
antiquarks carry one anti-color.

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,818
The interaction between quarks proceeds
through the exchange of color.

25
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:12,510
The intermediate vector bosons transmitting
the strong force are the eight gluons, g.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,960
They carry a color and an anti-color,
and therefore are not color neutral.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,140
This is in contrast to the photon which couples
to the electromagnetic charge but

28
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,120
does not carry one itself.

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,440
For strong interaction,
there are eight gluons in total.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,870
With three colors and

31
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,335
three anti-colors one would expect
a total of nine combinations.

32
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:40,577
One of them, the fully symmetric combination,
that is

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,479
red-antired plus green-antigreen plus 
blue-antiblue,

34
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,490
has no net color, it does not
participate in strong interaction and

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,670
so cannot be produced.

36
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,248
The remaining eight gluons are
vector bosons,

37
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:59,800
they are electromagnetically neutral and
have zero mass.

38
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,690
The basic vertex of the strong
quark interactions changes

39
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,310
the color of the quark.

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,810
The coupling constant g
appearing in the vertex

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,960
enters into the cross
section through its square.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,050
Alpha strong is equal to g^2/(4π),

43
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,850
in analogy to the electromagnetic
fine structure constant alpha.

44
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,070
The interaction has the same strength for
the three colors or

45
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,720
any of their superpositions.

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,170
So there is invariance under
an overall rotation in color space.

47
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,080
According to Noether's theorem, this
requires a conservation law for colors.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,910
The vertex conserves color.

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,590
The corresponding amplitude is
also independent of the flavors of

50
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,510
quarks and their electromagnetic
charge, which are both ignored and

51
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,140
conserved by strong interactions.

52
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,830
If gluons carry themselves color,

53
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,520
they should be able to
interact among themselves.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,613
Because they carry even color and anti
color, there are two additional vertices.

55
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:15,175
The color indices indicated here
are only examples.

56
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,625
The three-gluonvertex
is proportional to g and

57
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,562
has the same strength as the quark-gluon vertex.

58
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,185
We must, in each calculation, consider the
fact that there are many more different

59
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:31,230
colors for gluons than for quarks.

60
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,420
The vertex with four gluons on
the contrary is proportional to g^2

61
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,883
and thus disfavored with
respect to the other two.

62
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,590
Color does not show up as a quantum number
in our characterization of hadrons.

63
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,290
They are white.

64
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,659
So far all established mesons are q-qbar states and

65
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:01,936
all established baryons are three—quark states
of neutral color.

66
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:05,185
Recently, the LHCb collaboration

67
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,420
has discovered pentaquark states 
consisting of five quarks.

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,300
However it's still unclear
whether these are bound 

69
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,650
baryon-meson states as shown in
the picture on the left or

70
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,570
genuine compact multi-quark
states as sketched on the right.

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,490
LHCb has also confirmed the existence
of a tetra-quark state

72
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,736
first observed by the BELLE
collaboration in Japan.

73
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:36,060
Again, the same reservations apply.

74
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,298
It could still be
a meson-meson bound state,

75
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,096
rather than a compact four-quark state.

76
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:47,120
Mesons contain a superposition of 
quark-antiquark pais with

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,927
all colors in equal proportions.

78
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:56,670
A snapshot is shown here for
the interior of a positive pion.

79
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,620
Gluons are constantly exchanged
between quarks to maintain binding,

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,380
changing the color of quarks,
as in this sketch,

81
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,052
while keeping the overall hadron white.

82
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:12,420
The same mechanism works
inside baryons.

83
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,250
Between hadrons, for example in a nucleus,
objects of neutral color

84
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,800
are exchanged to create binding,
except at very short distances.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,230
It follows that an ab initio description of
the nuclear force stays very difficult,

86
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,470
although we dispose of
a well-established quantum theory for

87
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,534
interaction between quarks and gluons,
namely QCD.

88
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,680
At short distances,
comparable to the hadron size,

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,853
the exchange of gluons produces
a potential between quark and antiquark 

90
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:56,010
which is similar to the one established
by photons in a positronium bound state.

91
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:02,600
This potential varies with distance as
1/r like the Coulomb potential.

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,080
At large distances,
there is a different behavior,

93
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,270
the potential becomes
larger with distance.

94
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,070
We already saw a potential that fits
the description of the spectra of J/Psi and

95
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,875
Upsilon states in video 5.3.

96
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,040
The second term determines the behavior
of the long range potential with

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,410
a constant K equal to
about 1 GeV/fm.

98
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,940
This corresponds to a constant
long distance force

99
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,820
equivalent to the one required
to lift a weight of 16 tons.

100
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,710
The second term is created by
the interaction between gluons.

101
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,750
In terms of a chromostatic language,

102
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,100
the additional force between gluons
concentrates the color field

103
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,130
along a corridor that connects
the two color charges.

104
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,110
Because of the particular
shape of the field,

105
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,530
one also call this a string
that connects the colors.

106
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,700
The potential proportional to

107
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,810
k times r does not allow color and
anti-color to be separated,

108
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,241
but confines them to distances
of the order of 1 fm.

109
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,070
The potential inside hadrons ought
to be generated dynamically

110
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,660
by the interaction between the quarks and
gluons.

111
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,600
Obtaining results is complicated by
difficulties which are both conceptual and

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,080
technical.

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,750
Both the confinement of color
at large distance and

114
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,650
the relativistic and quasi-free movement
of quarks must be incorporated.

115
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,870
One must treat states with
multiple quarks and gluons.

116
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,060
The evolution of the strong coupling

117
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,970
constant alpha_strong with four-momentum transfer
q^2 must be taken into account.

118
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,490
We will talk about this
effect in a moment.

119
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,970
Calculation techniques are considerably
simplified if one replaces

120
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,660
the space-time continuum by a mesh
of equidistant discrete points,

121
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,487
similar to a crystal lattice with sides a.

122
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:14,960
One defines the quark fields
on the sites of the lattice,

123
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,180
and gluon fields on the links.

124
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,240
The continuum of space-time is recovered
in the limit of an infinitely large lattice

125
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,030
with a -> 0.

126
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,485
This discretization introduces
a lower limit on momentum-transfer

127
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,860
of the order of 1/a,

128
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,810
and thus regularizes the divergences
inherent to pertulative QCD.

129
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,540
Numerical calculations of this kind
require tremendous computing resources.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,674
They are performed on the most
powerful supercomputers.

131
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:50,600
With this non-perturbative method,
one arrives, fo

132
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,200
example, at results for
the spectrum of light hadrons.

133
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,450
The calculated masses are the average for
the different particle types.

134
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,940
For instance, the mass of nucleon is
the average of the mass of the proton and

135
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,440
the neutron.

136
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,390
Parameters of the calculation are the
strong coupling constant, alpha_strong,

137
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,350
and the masses of light quarks up and
down, and the quark strange.

138
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,579
They are fixed using the measured
mass of pions, kaons and 

139
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,611
Xi as reference.

140
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:29,840
This results in a pretty
impressive understanding of

141
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,240
the hadron spectrum, suggesting that
QCD is indeed a correct theory for

142
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,182
strong interaction also
at larger distances.

143
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:44,684
Distance laws for
electromagnetic and

144
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:48,570
strong interaction are fundamentally different.

145
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:54,536
The electromagnetic potential decreases
as 1/r as a function of distance.

146
00:10:54,536 --> 00:11:00,044
The strong potential increases at
long distances proportional to r.

147
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:02,361
To understand this difference,

148
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:07,690
we must consider quantum correction
to the photon and to the gluon propagators.

149
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,020
A significant correction to the photon propagator

150
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,280
is the one which introduces
an electron-positron loop.

151
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,010
This loop creates additional electric
charges between the projectile and target.

152
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,440
We call this phenomenon
vacuum polarization.

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,670
In electrostatic language we
can say that these additional

154
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,008
charges screen the target charge.

155
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:35,830
Therefore the effective charge
decreases with distance.

156
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,520
That is, it increases with
growing momentum transfer q^2.

157
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,880
This is, indeed,
what we find experimentally.

158
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,200
For electrodynamics,
this is a small effect.

159
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,960
To see a change of alpha of a few percent,
we have to compare momentum

160
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,730
transfer at almost zero that
is at very large distances,

161
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,090
where alpha is measured
to be about 1/137

162
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,882
– see the example of the Penning
trap in video 4.3 –

163
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:11,629
to the energy of the Large Electron
Positron collider at CERN,

164
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:18,700
where the momentum transfer q^2
is around 10^4 GeV^2.

165
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,410
That is at very short distances.

166
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,660
For strong interactions, the effect
of vacuum polarisation is much more

167
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,790
pronounced. Because of the size
of the strong coupling, the vacuum polarization

168
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,800
and the change in the net charge
with distance are more important.

169
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,080
In addition,
the sign of the effect is reversed.

170
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,020
The strong force becomes
stronger with distance.

171
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,600
This is because there are two types of
vacuum polarization graphs for gluons.

172
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,450
The analogue of electromagnetic
polarization introduces quark-antiquark

173
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,500
loops in the gluon propagator
which shield the colors charge.

174
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,150
But in addition,
the coupling of gluons between them

175
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,390
introduces gluon loops which
have the opposite sign.

176
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,730
And in the chromostatic language,
we can say that the gluon loops

177
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,670
introduce additional color-anticolor
charges which are attractive.

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,090
This reinforces the color charge of
the target instead of shielding it.

179
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,910
Because of the large number of gluons, and

180
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,500
their zero mass, gluon loops dominate
the strong vacuum polarization.

181
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,589
Consequently, the color charge
of the target increases with

182
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,720
distance proportional to the inverse
of the momentum transfer.

183
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,477
Indeed one experimentally 
finds that this effect is

184
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:53,441
more significant than its
electromagnetic counterpart.

185
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:58,390
In the next video we will see
how these properties of strong

186
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,330
interaction keep us from
seeing free quarks.
