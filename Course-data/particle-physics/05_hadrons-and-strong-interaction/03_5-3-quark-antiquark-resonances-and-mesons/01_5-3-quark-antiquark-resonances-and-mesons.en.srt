2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,109
In this module, we are in the process
of discussing the internal structure of

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,635
hadrons and strong interactions.

4
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:19,145
In this video, we discuss mesons,

5
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,585
which are bound states between quarks and
antiquarks.

6
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:26,705
After following this video, you will know
the basic mechanisms that bind quarks and

7
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:31,330
antiquarks to form mesons, and
their excited states and their spectra,

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,520
which provide information about the nature
and behavior of the binding force.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,040
In addition to the baryons and
their resonances,

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,260
which we have already treated
in the previous video,

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,560
there are bound states between quarks and
antiquarks which we call mesons.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,640
If their quantum numbers are right,
they can be produced in vacuo

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,830
by a virtual photon,
as shown in this Feynman diagram.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,978
For light quarks,
their mass is dominated by binding energy.

15
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:03,435
For heavy quarks, their mass is slightly
lower than the sum of the masses of

16
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,380
the corresponding quark pair.

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,730
An example is the production
of rho mesons,

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,870
a bound state between light quarks,
which is shown in this Feynman diagram.

19
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:17,455
Resonances can also appear as intermediate
states in hadronic reactions.

20
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:22,105
In this case, there's obviously more
freedom regarding their quantum numbers.

21
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,150
In general,
bound states between quarks and

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,435
antiquarks have a rather short lifetime,
especially if heavy quarks are involved.

23
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:32,305
This is due to the substantial phase
space available for their decay.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,300
The energy dependence of
the electron-positron cross section around

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,440
a resonance generally follows
a Breit-Wigner function,

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,180
which is shown in this equation.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,570
M is the mass and
Gamma is the width of the resonance.

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,190
The cross section is reduced
to half of its maximum value,

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,020
sigma_max, for square root of s equal
to M Â± Gamma/2.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,395
The lifetime of the resonance is
the inverse value of the width,

31
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,440
tau is equal to one over gamma.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,850
The form of the Breit-Wigner function
resembles the squared amplitude

33
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,210
of a classical damped oscillator.

34
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,350
Square root of s corresponds to the
frequency of the external periodic force,

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,548
M to the resonance frequency and
Gamma to the damping factor.

36
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:25,310
The cross section in this analogy
appears as the squared amplitude

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,930
of the oscillation,
as shown in the graph on the left.

38
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,734
For resonances between light quarks,
such as rho and omega,

39
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:38,657
one observes widths from a few MeV to 150
MeV, corresponding to lifetimes between 

40
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:41,528
10^-22 and 10^-24 seconds.

41
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:46,622
They are produced in a resonant manner
by the intermediate photon when the mass

42
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:51,040
of the virtual photon is sufficiently
close to that of the meson.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,410
When produced this way they must
obviously have spin one and charge zero,

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,390
just as the photon does.

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,620
They decay into pions.

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,295
Around a mass of about one GeV,
one can produce the Phi resonance,

47
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:08,310
which is an s-sbar bound state,
which decays into strange particles.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,066
It's width is narrow,
of the order of 4.4 MeV.

49
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:19,897
Around 3 GeV, we find the J/Psi
resonance, the lowest lying

50
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:24,560
c-cbar bound state, as well as its
excited states, the Psi mesons.

51
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,155
Their width are small,
about 90 keV for the J/Psi, itself.

52
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:35,580
Their lifetime is thus long, and the 
e+e- -> hadron cross section

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,840
is significantly enhanced around the
resonance energy, as shown in this plot.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,446
Close to 10 GeV, the Upsilon resonances
are produced, made of b-bbar pairs.

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,516
We see on the right the 
e+e- -> hadrons cross section

56
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:55,542
around the Upsilon_1s resonance,
and its excited states,

57
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:59,970
Upsilon_2s and Upsilon_3s,
all mesons formed by b-bbar states.

58
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,207
The states are distinguished by
the relative angular momentum of the two

59
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:04,769
quarks.

60
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,047
The spins are always parallel
to produce a vector meson.

61
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:14,984
The study of resonance states, especially
those of heavy quarks, allow us to

62
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:20,380
better understand the potential generated
by the strong force that binds quarks and

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,580
antiquarks into mesons, as well as also
the decay mechanisms for heavy quarks.

64
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,075
As an example, the figure shows the mass
spectrum and decay scheme of c-cbar and

65
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:32,180
b-bbar resonances.

66
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,270
The energy levels indicate that
the potential between two quarks

67
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,870
has two terms.

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,550
The parameter alpha_s, of order of 0.2,

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,030
is the strong interaction analog of the
electromagnetic fine-structure constant.

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,890
The first term diminishes with distance.

71
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,600
The second term, on the contrary,
grows with distance and

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,475
keeps the two quarks from being separated.

73
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,145
The constant in this confining term
is of the order of 1 GeV/fm.

74
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:05,689
In video 5.4, we will discuss in more
detail the properties of the strong

75
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,680
interactions which provide
this binding force.

76
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:15,395
The peaks of the cross section around
resonances invites to build storage rings

77
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,310
for the mass production of
the corresponding states.

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,169
The collider DAFNE in Frascati,
Italy is one such factory

79
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,249
dedicated to the production
of Phi resonances.

80
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:32,460
The Beijing e+e- storage ring, BEPC,
produces J/Psi and Psi mesons.

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,100
The PEP-II collider in
the United States and

82
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,520
KEKB in Japan are factories for
the Upsilon and other b-bbar mesons.

83
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,300
The systematic decrease of
the width with the mass of

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,370
the resonance could make you believe that
a t-tbar resonance would be very narrow,

85
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,130
and thus have a long lifetime and
a significant cross section.

86
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,810
This, however, is not at all the case.

87
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,750
The top quark is so heavy, on the order
of 175 GeV, that the phase space for

88
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,110
its decay becomes enormous.

89
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,710
The t-quark lifetime is
thus extremely short.

90
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,090
It decays before it can
even form a bound state.

91
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,810
Consequently, there will be hardly
an increase in e+e- cross section

92
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,485
at the threshold for
the production of pairs of top quarks.

93
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,235
In the next video, Mercedes will
discuss what all of this means for

94
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,376
the properties of strong interaction.

95
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:32,189
