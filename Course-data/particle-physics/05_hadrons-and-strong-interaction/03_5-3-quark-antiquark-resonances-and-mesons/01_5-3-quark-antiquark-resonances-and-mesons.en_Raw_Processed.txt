in this module, we in process 
discussing internal structure 
hadrons strong interactions 
in this video, we discuss mesons, 
bound states between quarks 
antiquarks 
following this video, you will know 
basic mechanisms that bind quarks 
antiquarks to form mesons, 
excited states spectra, 
provide information nature 
behavior binding force 
in addition to baryons 
resonances, 
we already treated 
in previous video, 
there bound states between quarks 
antiquarks we call mesons 
if quantum numbers right, 
produced in vacuo 
a virtual photon, 
shown in this feynman diagram 
light quarks, 
mass is dominated binding energy 
heavy quarks, mass is slightly 
lower sum masses 
corresponding quark pair 
an example is production 
rho mesons, 
a bound state between light quarks, 
is shown in this feynman diagram 
resonances also appear intermediate 
states in hadronic reactions 
in this case, theres obviously 
freedom regarding quantum numbers 
in general, 
bound states between quarks 
antiquarks a rather short lifetime, 
especially if heavy quarks involved 
this is due to substantial phase 
space available decay 
energy dependence 
electronpositron cross section around 
a resonance generally follows 
a breitwigner function, 
is shown in this equation 
m is mass 
gamma is width resonance 
cross section is reduced 
to half maximum value, 
sigmamax, square root equal 
to m gamma 
lifetime resonance is 
inverse value width, 
tau is equal to one gamma 
form breitwigner function 
resembles squared amplitude 
a classical damped oscillator 
square root corresponds to 
frequency external periodic force, 
m to resonance frequency 
gamma to damping factor 
cross section in this analogy 
appears squared amplitude 
oscillation, 
shown in graph left 
resonances between light quarks, 
rho omega, 
one observes widths a few mev to 
mev, corresponding to lifetimes between 
seconds 
produced in a resonant manner 
intermediate photon mass 
virtual photon is sufficiently 
close to that meson 
produced this way must 
obviously spin one charge zero, 
photon 
decay pions 
around a mass one gev, 
one produce phi resonance, 
is an ssbar bound state, 
decays strange particles 
width is narrow, 
order mev 
around gev, we find jpsi 
resonance, lowest lying 
ccbar bound state, well 
excited states, psi mesons 
width small, 
kev jpsi, 
lifetime is thus long, 
ee hadron cross section 
is significantly enhanced around 
resonance energy, shown in this plot 
close to gev, upsilon resonances 
produced, made bbbar pairs 
we see right 
ee hadrons cross section 
around upsilons resonance, 
excited states, 
upsilons upsilons, 
mesons formed bbbar states 
states distinguished 
relative angular momentum two 
quarks 
spins always parallel 
to produce a vector meson 
study resonance states, especially 
heavy quarks, allow us to 
better understand potential generated 
strong force that binds quarks 
antiquarks mesons, well also 
decay mechanisms heavy quarks 
an example, figure shows mass 
spectrum decay scheme ccbar 
bbbar resonances 
energy levels indicate that 
potential between two quarks 
two terms 
parameter alphas, order , 
is strong interaction analog 
electromagnetic finestructure constant 
first term diminishes distance 
second term, contrary, 
grows distance 
keeps two quarks separated 
constant in this confining term 
is order gevfm 
in video , we will discuss in 
detail properties strong 
interactions provide 
this binding force 
peaks cross section around 
resonances invites to build storage rings 
mass production 
corresponding states 
collider dafne in frascati, 
italy is one factory 
dedicated to production 
phi resonances 
beijing ee storage ring, bepc, 
produces jpsi psi mesons 
pepii collider in 
united states 
kekb in japan factories 
upsilon bbbar mesons 
systematic decrease 
width mass 
resonance could make you believe that 
a ttbar resonance would narrow, 
thus a long lifetime 
a significant cross section 
this, however, is case 
top quark is so heavy, order 
gev, that phase space 
decay becomes enormous 
tquark lifetime is 
thus extremely short 
decays 
even form a bound state 
consequently, there will hardly 
an increase in ee cross section 
threshold 
production pairs top quarks 
in next video, mercedes will 
discuss this means 
properties strong interaction
