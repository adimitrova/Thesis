hello, 
welcome to this fifth module 
introductory course to subatomic physics 
in this module, 
well discuss structure hadrons 
strong interactions 
in this first video, 
we discussed elastic electromagnetic 
scattering between electrons nucleons, 
is one ways used to 
study structure hadrons 
following this video, 
you will know main properties 
elastic scattering between fermions, 
meaning different terms 
that enter cross section 
form factor concept you will know, 
interpretation, 
in terms size nucleon 
you will get to know 
historic experiments stanford 
linear accelerator center in this area 
structure an interaction is 
known, used a tool to better 
understand particles 
that involved 
within this video, elastic 
electron nucleon scattering 
is used to determine internal 
structure nucleons 
we take advantage fact that 
electron far we know, 
is a point like particle in that we know 
electromagnetic interactions well 
we thus elucidate a single, 
important unknown, 
is distribution dynamics 
quarks inside proton neutron, 
represented big blue 
dot in right diagram 
well see in video , also, 
meson resonances formed 
an incident photon, example 
used to better understand 
strong force that binds quarks 
antiquarks together 
prototype process 
scattering between point like 
fermions is electron muon scattering 
is similar to e e annihilation, 
feynman diagram 
rotated degrees 
we will approach this process in steps 
first step is already shown here, 
since we encountered in past 
is to consider scattering 
a heavy type target, 
is without structure 
without spin 
also, ignoring spin incoming 
electron, neglecting mass, 
we obtain formula shown here, 
rutherford cross section, 
we already encountered in video 
usual, factor alpha squared comes 
two electromagnetic vertices 
denominator contains square 
characteristic energy 
results propagator 
virtual photon, one q, 
you easily verify this in 
approximation that mass 
electron is negligible, i here 
angular distribution 
is extremely steep 
scattering point like particles, 
peaks small angles 
this remains valid including 
effect target recoil, 
spin particles 
additional term in red, 
shown here m 
mass target, takes 
account recoil 
is ratio between incident 
outgoing electron 
energy ee 
this ratio is an infinitely 
heavy target, less 
an important recoil 
this formula still neglects magnetic 
component interaction 
a point like fermion target a 
magnetic moment, em 
one finds complete mott formula 
given bottom page, 
quoted here in laboratory frame, 
relativistic electron projectiles 
last term in red is 
a magnetic nature 
becomes important high 
momentum transfers q, 
much larger mass 
target squared 
angular distribution, still roughly 
follows form rutherford 
formula, third term contains subterms 
proportional to cosine squared theta, 
to sine squared theta, 
reduce a little steepness 
angular distribution 
historic experiments elastic 
scattering between electrons protons 
conducted stanford linear 
accelerator center in 
experiment consisted 
a liquid hydrogen target 
bombarded electrons 
a few hundred mev 
in final state, 
electron is observed, 
in two spectrometers positioned 
variable scattering angles 
kinematics hadronic 
final state is deduced 
energymomentum conservation, 
assuming a target rest 
here results cross section 
a function scattering angle left, 
a function 
incident electron energy right 
measurements confirm calculations 
modest energies, 
already one gev 
one observes a steep angular 
distribution in left plot, 
a strong reduction cross section 
energy in right plot, 
we expected formulae 
let us consider happens if 
target is a pointlike particle 
let us first take model a static 
charge distribution rhox, 
normalized that charge 
target remains elementary, 
means that integral 
rhox must equal to 
cross section will 
reduced respect to a pointlike target 
a factor f, 
a socalled form factor 
we already used this concept in video 
, we discussed size nuclei 
in static case, 
f is simply fourier transform 
spatial charged distribution 
small momentum transfers, 
one develop form vectors 
in powers q times x 
if distribution possess 
spherical symmetry, that is rhox 
is a function r, 
spatial 
directions separately, 
terms odd exponent will conribute 
thus, form factor measures mean 
square radius charge distribution, 
r, represents 
size distribution 
take, example, an exponential 
distribution a function distance 
leads to socalled dipolar 
form factor that is shown 
in last formula right 
is clear that in case 
a nonstatic charge distribution, 
things get complicated 
first, magnetic interactions come in, 
since target is moving 
second, charge distribution 
changes time 
represented timelike component 
fourmomentum transfer q 
action moving charges 
inside distribution, electric 
magnetic terms will modified, 
functions will in fact mixed 
we find cross section 
given here parameter tau, 
is ratio between momentum 
transfer target mass squared, 
ratio two quantities, 
characterize this process 
we call ge gm electric 
magnetic form factors, 
although distinction between two 
obviously depends reference frame 
in sense, one attribute 
ge gm to fourier transforms 
charge magnetic moment 
distribution target particle, 
even though this interpretation is, 
strictly speaking, 
valid in a 
special reference frame 
form factors ge 
gm proton measured analyzing 
differential cross sections 
reaction e p e p, 
separating terms proportional 
to cosine squared theta 
sine squared theta 
angular distribution 
we observe that ge gm follow 
dipolar shape, predicted 
exponential charge distributions 
parameter lambda characterizes 
size distribution, 
we find lambda equal to gev, 
in cases 
size distribution is thus 
order fm 
electric 
magnetic form factors 
finding distribution 
form factors is a miracle 
quarks inside nucleon 
origin charge 
magnetic moment distributions, 
that we find 
distribution theyre 
caused ingredient 
figure shows representative 
results obtained hoffstetter 
collaborators slac in 
form factors ge, shown left, 
gm, shown right, 
proton measured a function 
momentum transfer squared, 
extracted cross section 
elastic electron proton cross section 
one finds dipolar shape, 
g equals one one plus q 
lambda squared, squared, 
size perimeter lambda equal to gev 
in next video, we will see 
happens we increase q, 
that exchanged photon excite, 
even break nucleon
