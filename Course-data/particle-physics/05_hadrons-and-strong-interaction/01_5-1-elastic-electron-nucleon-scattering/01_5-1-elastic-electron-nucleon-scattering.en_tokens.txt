hello
,
and
welcome
to
this
fifth
module
of
our
introductory
course
to
subatomic
physics
.
in
this
module
,
we
'll
discuss
the
structure
of
hadrons
and
strong
interactions
.
in
this
first
video
,
we
discussed
the
elastic
electromagnetic
scattering
between
electrons
and
nucleons
,
which
is
one
of
the
ways
used
to
study
the
structure
of
hadrons
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
main
properties
of
elastic
scattering
between
fermions
,
and
the
meaning
of
the
different
terms
that
enter
into
the
cross
section
.
the
form
factor
concept
you
will
know
,
and
its
interpretation
,
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
nucleon
.
and
you
will
get
to
know
the
historic
experiments
at
the
stanford
linear
accelerator
center
in
this
area
.
when
the
structure
of
an
interaction
is
known
,
it
can
be
used
as
a
tool
to
better
understand
the
particles
that
are
involved
.
within
this
video
,
how
elastic
electron
nucleon
scattering
is
used
to
determine
the
internal
structure
of
nucleons
.
we
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
electron
as
far
as
we
know
,
is
a
point
like
particle
in
that
we
know
electromagnetic
interactions
very
well
.
we
can
thus
elucidate
a
single
,
but
important
unknown
,
which
is
the
distribution
and
the
dynamics
of
quarks
inside
the
proton
and
neutron
,
represented
by
the
big
blue
dot
in
the
right
diagram
.
weÃ¢ÂÂll
see
in
video
5.3
,
also
,
how
meson
resonances
are
formed
by
an
incident
photon
,
for
example
.
these
can
be
used
to
better
understand
the
strong
force
that
binds
quarks
and
anti-quarks
together
.
the
prototype
process
for
the
scattering
between
point
like
fermions
is
electron
muon
scattering
.
it
is
very
similar
to
e+
e-
annihilation
,
with
the
feynman
diagram
rotated
by
90
degrees
.
we
will
approach
this
process
in
steps
.
the
first
step
is
already
shown
here
,
since
we
have
encountered
it
in
the
past
.
it
is
to
consider
scattering
of
a
very
heavy
type
target
,
which
is
without
structure
and
without
spin
.
also
,
ignoring
the
spin
of
the
incoming
electron
,
and
neglecting
its
mass
,
we
obtain
the
formula
shown
here
,
the
rutherford
cross
section
,
which
we
already
encountered
in
video
1.4.
as
usual
,
the
factor
alpha
squared
comes
from
the
two
electromagnetic
vertices
.
the
denominator
contains
the
square
of
the
characteristic
energy
.
it
results
from
the
propagator
of
the
virtual
photon
,
one
over
q^2
,
and
you
can
easily
verify
this
in
the
approximation
that
the
mass
of
the
electron
is
negligible
,
as
i
did
here
.
the
angular
distribution
is
extremely
steep
for
the
scattering
of
point
like
particles
,
and
it
peaks
at
small
angles
.
this
remains
valid
when
including
the
effect
of
the
target
recoil
,
and
the
spin
of
the
particles
.
the
additional
term
in
red
,
shown
here
with
m
the
mass
of
the
target
,
takes
into
account
the
recoil
.
it
is
the
ratio
between
the
incident
and
the
outgoing
electron
energy
eÃ¢ÂÂ/e
.
this
ratio
is
1
for
an
infinitely
heavy
target
,
but
less
than
1
for
an
important
recoil
.
this
formula
still
neglects
the
magnetic
component
of
the
interaction
.
for
a
point
like
fermion
target
with
a
magnetic
moment
,
Ã¢Âµ
=
e/
(
2m
)
.
one
finds
the
complete
mott
formula
given
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
,
quoted
here
in
the
laboratory
frame
,
and
for
relativistic
electron
projectiles
.
the
last
term
in
red
is
of
a
magnetic
nature
.
it
becomes
important
at
high
momentum
transfers
q^2
,
much
larger
than
the
mass
of
the
target
squared
the
angular
distribution
,
still
roughly
follows
the
form
of
the
rutherford
formula
,
the
third
term
contains
sub-terms
proportional
to
cosine
squared
theta
,
and
to
sine
squared
theta
,
which
reduce
a
little
the
steepness
of
the
angular
distribution
.
the
historic
experiments
on
elastic
scattering
between
electrons
and
protons
have
been
conducted
at
the
stanford
linear
accelerator
center
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
.
the
experiment
consisted
of
a
liquid
hydrogen
target
bombarded
by
electrons
of
a
few
hundred
mev
.
in
the
final
state
,
only
the
electron
is
observed
,
in
two
spectrometers
positioned
at
variable
scattering
angles
.
the
kinematics
of
the
hadronic
final
state
is
then
deduced
from
energy-momentum
conservation
,
assuming
a
target
at
rest
.
here
are
some
results
on
the
cross
section
as
a
function
of
the
scattering
angle
on
the
left
,
and
as
a
function
of
the
incident
electron
energy
on
the
right
.
the
measurements
confirm
the
calculations
at
these
modest
energies
,
already
below
one
gev
.
one
observes
a
steep
angular
distribution
in
the
left
plot
,
and
a
strong
reduction
of
the
cross
section
with
energy
in
the
right
plot
,
as
we
expected
from
the
formulae
.
let
us
now
consider
what
happens
if
the
target
is
not
a
point-like
particle
.
let
us
first
take
the
model
of
a
static
charge
distribution
rho
(
x
)
,
normalized
such
that
the
charge
of
the
target
remains
elementary
,
which
means
that
the
integral
over
rho
(
x
)
must
be
equal
to
1.
the
cross
section
then
will
be
reduced
with
respect
to
a
point-like
target
by
a
factor
of
f^2
,
a
so-called
form
factor
.
we
have
already
used
this
concept
in
video
2.2
,
when
we
discussed
the
size
of
nuclei
.
in
the
static
case
,
f
is
simply
the
fourier
transform
of
the
spatial
charged
distribution
.
for
small
momentum
transfers
,
one
can
develop
the
form
vectors
in
powers
of
q
times
x.
if
the
distribution
possess
spherical
symmetry
,
that
is
rho
(
x
)
is
only
a
function
of
r
,
and
not
of
the
spatial
directions
separately
,
terms
with
odd
exponent
will
not
conribute
.
thus
,
the
form
factor
measures
the
mean
square
radius
of
the
charge
distribution
,
<
r^2
>
,
which
represents
the
size
of
the
distribution
.
take
,
for
example
,
an
exponential
distribution
as
a
function
of
distance
.
it
leads
to
the
so-called
dipolar
form
factor
that
is
shown
in
the
last
formula
on
the
right
.
it
is
clear
that
in
the
case
of
a
non-static
charge
distribution
,
things
get
more
complicated
.
first
,
magnetic
interactions
come
in
,
since
the
target
is
moving
.
second
,
the
charge
distribution
itself
changes
during
the
time
represented
by
the
time-like
component
of
the
four-momentum
transfer
q_0
.
by
the
action
of
the
moving
charges
inside
the
distribution
,
electric
and
magnetic
terms
will
be
modified
,
and
their
functions
will
in
fact
be
mixed
up
.
we
then
find
the
cross
section
given
here
with
the
parameter
tau
,
which
is
the
ratio
between
the
momentum
transfer
and
the
target
mass
squared
,
the
ratio
of
the
two
quantities
,
which
characterize
this
process
.
we
call
g_e
and
g_m
the
electric
and
magnetic
form
factors
,
although
the
distinction
between
the
two
obviously
depends
on
the
reference
frame
.
in
the
same
sense
,
one
can
attribute
g_e
and
g_m
to
the
fourier
transforms
of
the
charge
and
magnetic
moment
distribution
of
the
target
particle
,
even
though
this
interpretation
is
,
strictly
speaking
,
only
valid
in
a
very
special
reference
frame
.
the
form
factors
g_e
and
g_m
of
the
proton
are
measured
by
analyzing
the
differential
cross
sections
for
the
reaction
e-
p
-
>
e-
p
,
and
separating
the
terms
proportional
to
cosine
squared
theta
and
sine
squared
theta
of
the
angular
distribution
.
we
observe
that
g_e
and
g_m
follow
the
dipolar
shape
,
predicted
for
exponential
charge
distributions
.
the
parameter
lambda
then
characterizes
the
size
of
the
distribution
,
and
we
find
lambda
equal
to
0.84
gev
,
in
both
cases
.
the
size
of
the
distribution
is
thus
of
order
1
fm
and
the
same
for
electric
and
magnetic
form
factors
.
finding
the
same
distribution
for
both
form
factors
is
not
a
miracle
.
the
quarks
inside
the
nucleon
are
at
the
origin
of
both
charge
and
magnetic
moment
distributions
,
such
that
we
find
the
same
distribution
because
they
're
caused
by
the
same
ingredient
.
the
figure
shows
representative
results
obtained
by
hoffstetter
and
collaborators
at
slac
in
the
1960s
.
the
form
factors
g_e
,
shown
on
the
left
,
and
g_m
,
shown
on
the
right
,
for
the
proton
are
measured
as
a
function
of
the
momentum
transfer
squared
,
and
extracted
from
the
cross
section
for
the
elastic
electron
proton
cross
section
.
one
finds
the
dipolar
shape
,
g
equals
one
over
one
plus
q^2
over
lambda
squared
,
both
squared
,
with
the
same
size
perimeter
lambda
equal
to
0.84
gev
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
see
what
happens
when
we
increase
q^2
,
such
that
the
exchanged
photon
can
excite
,
or
even
break
the
nucleon
.
