2
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:11,183
Hello, and

3
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:15,680
welcome to this fifth module of our
introductory course to subatomic physics.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,266
In this module,
we'll discuss the structure of hadrons and

5
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,681
strong interactions.

6
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:21,756
In this first video,

7
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:26,244
we discussed the elastic electromagnetic
scattering between electrons and nucleons,

8
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:29,429
which is one of the ways used to
study the structure of hadrons.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,920
After following this video,

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,590
you will know the main properties of
elastic scattering between fermions, and

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,970
the meaning of the different terms
that enter into the cross section.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,010
The form factor concept you will know, and

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,310
its interpretation,
in terms of the size of the nucleon.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,370
And you will get to know

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,400
the historic experiments at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center in this area.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,200
When the structure of an interaction is
known, it can be used as a tool to better

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,910
understand the particles
that are involved.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,140
Within this video, how elastic
electron nucleon scattering

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,130
is used to determine the internal
structure of nucleons.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,830
We take advantage of the fact that
the electron as far as we know,

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,720
is a point like particle in that we know
electromagnetic interactions very well.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,318
We can thus elucidate a single,
but important unknown,

23
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:25,225
which is the distribution and the dynamics
of quarks inside the proton and neutron,

24
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:28,356
represented by the big blue
dot in the right diagram.

25
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,402
We’ll see in video 5.3, also,

26
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:35,740
how meson resonances are formed by
an incident photon, for example.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,815
These can be used to better understand
the strong force that binds quarks and

28
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:40,700
anti-quarks together.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,270
The prototype process for

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,960
the scattering between point like
fermions is electron muon scattering.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,330
It is very similar to e+ e- annihilation,

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,420
with the Feynman diagram
rotated by 90 degrees.

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,930
We will approach this process in steps.

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,660
The first step is already shown here,
since we have encountered it in the past.

35
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,076
It is to consider scattering
of a very heavy type target,

36
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,388
which is without structure and
without spin.

37
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:15,054
Also, ignoring the spin of the incoming
electron, and neglecting its mass,

38
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:19,011
we obtain the formula shown here,
the Rutherford cross section,

39
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:21,853
which we already encountered in video 1.4.

40
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:26,910
As usual, the factor alpha squared comes
from the two electromagnetic vertices.

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,552
The denominator contains the square
of the characteristic energy.

42
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,492
It results from the propagator of the
virtual photon, one over q^2, and

43
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,832
you can easily verify this in
the approximation that the mass of

44
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:43,180
the electron is negligible, as I did here.

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,470
The angular distribution
is extremely steep for

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,330
the scattering of point like particles,
and it peaks at small angles.

47
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,230
This remains valid when including
the effect of the target recoil, and

48
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,220
the spin of the particles.

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,040
The additional term in red,
shown here with M

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,619
the mass of the target, takes
into account the recoil.

51
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,580
It is the ratio between the incident and

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,410
the outgoing electron
energy E’/E.

53
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,060
This ratio is 1 for an infinitely
heavy target, but less than 1 for

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,220
an important recoil.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,100
This formula still neglects the magnetic
component of the interaction.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,790
For a point like fermion target with a
magnetic moment, µ = e/(2m).

57
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,520
One finds the complete Mott formula
given on the bottom of the page,

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,320
quoted here in the laboratory frame, and
for relativistic electron projectiles.

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,280
The last term in red is
of a magnetic nature.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
It becomes important at high
momentum transfers q^2,

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,410
much larger than the mass
of the target squared

62
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,108
The angular distribution, still roughly
follows the form of the Rutherford

63
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:56,913
formula, the third term contains sub-terms
proportional to cosine squared theta,

64
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,425
and to sine squared theta,

65
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,149
which reduce a little the steepness
of the angular distribution.

66
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:09,276
The historic experiments on elastic
scattering between electrons and protons

67
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:14,630
have been conducted at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in the 1960s and 1970s.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,660
The experiment consisted
of a liquid hydrogen target

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,870
bombarded by electrons
of a few hundred MeV.

70
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,740
In the final state,
only the electron is observed,

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,330
in two spectrometers positioned
at variable scattering angles.

72
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,320
The kinematics of the hadronic
final state is then deduced

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,870
from energy-momentum conservation,
assuming a target at rest.

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,950
Here are some results on the cross section
as a function of the scattering angle on the left,

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,730
and as a function of
the incident electron energy on the right.

76
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,532
The measurements confirm the calculations
at these modest energies,

77
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,700
already below one GeV.

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,100
One observes a steep angular
distribution in the left plot, and

79
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,660
a strong reduction of the cross section
with energy in the right plot,

80
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,680
as we expected from the formulae.

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,420
Let us now consider what happens if
the target is not a point-like particle.

82
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,880
Let us first take the model of a static
charge distribution rho(x),

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,580
normalized such that the charge
of the target remains elementary,

84
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,990
which means that the integral over
rho(x) must be equal to 1.

85
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,874
The cross section then will be
reduced with respect to a point-like target

86
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:33,710
by a factor of F^2,
a so-called form factor.

87
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,420
We have already used this concept in video
2.2, when we discussed the size of nuclei.

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,310
In the static case,

89
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,680
F is simply the Fourier transform
of the spatial charged distribution.

90
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,320
For small momentum transfers,

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,350
one can develop the form vectors
in powers of q times x.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,390
If the distribution possess
spherical symmetry, that is rho(x)

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,950
is only a function of r,
and not of the spatial

94
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,275
directions separately,
terms with odd exponent will not conribute.

95
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:16,478
Thus, the form factor measures the mean
square radius of the charge distribution,

96
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,450
<r^2>, which represents
the size of the distribution.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,150
Take, for example, an exponential
distribution as a function of distance.

98
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,480
It leads to the so-called dipolar
form factor that is shown

99
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,800
in the last formula on the right.

100
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,210
It is clear that in the case of
a non-static charge distribution,

101
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,970
things get more complicated.

102
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,780
First, magnetic interactions come in,
since the target is moving.

103
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,553
Second, the charge distribution
itself changes during the time

104
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:56,201
represented by the time-like component
of the four-momentum transfer q_0.

105
00:06:56,201 --> 00:07:00,065
By the action of the moving charges
inside the distribution, electric and

106
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,820
magnetic terms will be modified, and
their functions will in fact be mixed up.

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,820
We then find the cross section
given here with the parameter tau,

108
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,160
which is the ratio between the momentum
transfer and the target mass squared,

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,410
the ratio of the two quantities,
which characterize this process.

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,530
We call G_E and G_M the electric and
magnetic form factors,

111
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,880
although the distinction between the two
obviously depends on the reference frame.

112
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,039
In the same sense, one can attribute
G_E and G_M to the Fourier transforms

113
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,114
of the charge and magnetic moment
distribution of the target particle,

114
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,349
even though this interpretation is,
strictly speaking,

115
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:42,890
only valid in a very
special reference frame.

116
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:49,909
The form factors G_E and
G_M of the proton are measured by analyzing

117
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:55,860
the differential cross sections for
the reaction e- p -> e- p,

118
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,940
and separating the terms proportional
to cosine squared theta and

119
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,090
sine squared theta of
the angular distribution.

120
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,260
We observe that G_E and G_M follow
the dipolar shape, predicted for

121
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,420
exponential charge distributions.

122
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,411
The parameter Lambda then characterizes
the size of the distribution,

123
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,800
and we find Lambda equal to 0.84 GeV,
in both cases.

124
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,050
The size of the distribution is thus 
of order 1 fm and

125
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,350
the same for electric and
magnetic form factors.

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,700
Finding the same distribution for
both form factors is not a miracle.

127
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,110
The quarks inside the nucleon are
at the origin of both charge and

128
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,340
magnetic moment distributions,
such that we find

129
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,160
the same distribution because they're
caused by the same ingredient.

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,937
The figure shows representative
results obtained by Hoffstetter and

131
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,894
collaborators at SLAC in the 1960s.

132
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:56,778
The form factors G_E, shown on the left,
and G_M, shown on the right, for

133
00:08:56,778 --> 00:09:01,230
the proton are measured as a function
of the momentum transfer squared,

134
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,370
and extracted from the cross section for
the elastic electron proton cross section.

135
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,760
One finds the dipolar shape,
G equals one over one plus q^2 over

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,010
Lambda squared, both squared, with the same
size perimeter Lambda equal to 0.84 GeV.

137
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,944
In the next video, we will see what
happens when we increase q^2,

138
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:27,722
such that the exchanged photon can excite,
or even break the nucleon.

139
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:33,769
