00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,901
In this 6th module,
we are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,872
And in this third video, we will go
through the general properties of weak

4
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:20,615
interactions, which are not
quite like the others.

5
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:24,815
After following this video, you will know
about the nonconservation of parity for

6
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,005
weak interactions.

7
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,922
And the main vertices and
charges which are relevant.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,010
Weak interactions, in fact,
do not deserve their name.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,871
Their apparent weakness at low energy is
due to the fact that they are transmitted

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,911
by heavy particles,

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:44,085
the neutral Z, and
the charged W± bosons.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,570
Their propagator weakens the amplitude
at low momentum transfer.

13
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,570
Their coupling constant, g and
g’, on the other hand,

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,870
are of comparable magnitude
as the electric charge e.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,470
Indeed, they are connected by
the condition of electro-weak unification,

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,291
which involves the Weinberg angle theta_W.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,920
Its value is close to 30 degrees.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,270
So instead of three coupling constants,
there's only one and an angle.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,918
The tangent of this angle is
the ratio between g’ and g.

20
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:16,798
At the same time, it links the masses of

21
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:21,235
the weak bosons by 
cos theta_W = M_W/M_Z.

22
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:25,130
Feynman diagrams for typical charged and

23
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,520
neutral weak interactions
are shown in the two left graphs.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,800
Comparison with the corresponding photon
exchange diagram shows that the structure

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,250
of weak interactions is quite
similar to that of electromagnetism.

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,770
The neutral component of weak interactions
can even interfere with electromagnetic

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,300
interactions when it acts
between charged particles.

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,750
The charged weak interaction is the only
force that can change the flavor of matter

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,820
particles.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,638
It can even mediate between members of
different generations at the same vertex.

31
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,819
There are however other major
differences between electromagnetic and

32
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,760
weak interactions.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,493
The weak charge is a quantity
with two components,

34
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,601
in contrast with a single component for
the electromagnetic charge,

35
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,442
and three components for the color charge.

36
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:17,298
The weak charge is called weak
isospin by analogy to spin.

37
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:24,194
One characterizes particles by their total
weak isospin T and its third component T_3.

38
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,775
They determine the coupling
constants g and

39
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:30,064
g’ together with
the electromagnetic coupling e.

40
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:36,605
The weak force is transmitted by vector
bosons, similar to the photon and

41
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,235
the gluon, but very heavy.

42
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:44,474
The W± mass is of the order of 80 GeV,
that of the Z of order 90 GeV.

43
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:47,183
The two bosons carry
themselves weak isospin, and

44
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,670
can thus interact among themselves.

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,173
In addition, charged bosons can
obviously interact with the photon.

46
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:58,555
Weak interactions also
do not conserve parity.

47
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,800
Thus, they produce polarization phenomena
even from non-polarized initial states.

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,870
This explains the first part of the small
print at the bottom of this table.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,399
This non-conservation of parity is
the most visible example of symmetries,

50
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:17,930
which are respected by other interactions,
but not by weak interactions.

51
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,814
Weak interactions do not even
respect the combined CP symmetry,

52
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:25,206
and are therefore the only known
interaction which distinguishes between

53
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,456
matter and anti-matter.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,925
We will discuss this in video 6.8.

55
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,886
At the same time, and maybe even for
the same reason, they are the only

56
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:38,877
interactions which connect particles from
different generations at a single vertex.

57
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,345
They can thus not conserve flavor.

58
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,995
This fact is well established for quarks.

59
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:49,480
And also has been observed for
leptons as we will see in video 6.7 and

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,245
6.10, respectively.

61
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:57,045
Now let us first discuss the discovery
of parity nonconservation in charged

62
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,399
weak interactions.

63
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:03,481
In 1956, based on the study of
experimental data obtained by 

64
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:08,315
C.S. Wu, Lee and Yang concluded that
weak interactions are not invariant

65
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,588
under the operation of parity.

66
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:14,116
In order to investigate their behavior
under this transformation, Wu and

67
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:18,830
colleagues have designed an experiment
that remains a classic of our discipline.

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,050
It uses beta decay of neutrons n -> p e- nu_e-bar bound in Co-60 nuclei.

69
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,593
At low temperature of
the order of 0.01 Kelvin and

70
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:34,524
in the presence of a magnetic field,
the spin vectors of these nuclei with J=5

71
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,150
are strongly aligned with
the magnetic field direction.

72
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,143
Their decay,
Co-60 with J=5 into Ni-60 with J=4

73
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,110
can lead to two spin configurations.

74
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,650
p and E denote momentum and
energy of the emitted electron,

75
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,050
and sigma denotes a unit vector in
the direction of the spin of the nucleus.

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,010
In case a shown on top,

77
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,030
the electron is emitted in the direction
opposite to the Co-60 spin.

78
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,900
In case B, it is emitted in
the direction of the initial spin.

79
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,550
Any combination of
the two cases is allowed

80
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,200
by conservation of angular momentum.

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,510
The experiment showed the angular
distribution of case a exclusively.

82
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,570
It does not admit a contribution,
however small, of configuration b.

83
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,029
This corresponds to a maximum
violation of parity.

84
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,211
Indeed, conservation of parity
would imply that the probabilities

85
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:32,030
of the two configurations a and
b are the same.

86
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,590
This also means that
charged weak interactions

87
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,520
only admit a certain spin direction
of participating fermions.

88
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,380
In our example, the two spins of
electron and neutrino must be aligned

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,730
with that of the nucleus to
conserve total angular momentum.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,630
In case a, the electron spin is
antiparallel to its direction of motion.

91
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,430
The antineutrino spin is parallel.

92
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,000
So we find that the electron has
negative helicity, it is left handed.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,290
The antilepton has positive helicity,
it is right handed.

94
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,700
This property of charged weak
interactions can be generalized.

95
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,210
As far as we know, the W only
interacts with left-handed fermions,

96
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,407
fermions of negative helicity.

97
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:20,190
And right-handed antifermions,
antifermions of positive helicity.

98
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,310
Charged weak interactions thus
violate parity to a maximum extent.

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,525
Consequently, we assign left-handed
leptons to doublets of weak isospin.

100
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,910
Right-handed leptons to singlets.

101
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,420
In this way, left-handed matter
fields carry a weak charge and

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,375
are coupled to W and Z.

103
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,580
Right-handed matter fields do not.

104
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,960
In the same manner,
quarks are assigned to doublets and

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,290
singlets according to their helicity.

106
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,250
For antimatter fields,
the opposite is true.

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,695
Right-handed antileptons and
antiquark carry weak isospin.

108
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:56,334
Left-handed ones do not.

109
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:01,560
The W and Z themselves belong to
a triplet of weak isospin with T = 1.

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,710
They can therefore
interact among themselves.

111
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,083
In addition, the W± obviously
carries an electromagnetic charge and

112
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,171
can interact with a photon.

113
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:19,744
Weak interactions conserve weak
isospin such that the fundamental

114
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:24,980
weak interaction vertices with
matter are shown on this graph.

115
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:30,946
Here, l denotes a generic charged lepton.

116
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:34,363
And nu_l a neutrino of the same flavor.

117
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,110
q is an up-type quark.

118
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,677
q’ is a down-type quark.

119
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:42,195
The exact definitions we will reserve for
later.

120
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,145
W interactions change T_3 by one unit.

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,660
So a charged lepton is
transformed into a neutrino.

122
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,060
An up-type quark is transformed into
a down-type quark or vice versa.

123
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,170
Attention, the emitted quarks and

124
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,230
neutrinos do not necessarily
belong to the same generation.

125
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,990
The interaction of the Z boson keeps
T_3 the same and conserves flavor.

126
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,304
In the next video, we will present
a prototype of W interactions,

127
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,546
namely muon and tau lepton decay.
