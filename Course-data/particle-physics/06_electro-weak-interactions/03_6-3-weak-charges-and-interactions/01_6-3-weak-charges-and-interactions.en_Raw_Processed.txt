in this th module, 
we discussing weak interactions 
in this third video, we will go 
general properties weak 
interactions, 
quite like others 
following this video, you will know 
nonconservation parity 
weak interactions 
main vertices 
charges relevant 
weak interactions, in fact, 
deserve name 
apparent weakness low energy is 
due to fact that transmitted 
heavy particles, 
neutral z, 
charged w bosons 
propagator weakens amplitude 
low momentum transfer 
coupling constant, g 
g, hand, 
comparable magnitude 
electric charge e 
indeed, connected 
condition electroweak unification, 
involves weinberg angle thetaw 
value is close to degrees 
so instead three coupling constants, 
theres one an angle 
tangent this angle is 
ratio between g g 
time, links masses 
weak bosons 
cos thetaw mwmz 
feynman diagrams typical charged 
neutral weak interactions 
shown in two left graphs 
comparison corresponding photon 
exchange diagram shows that structure 
weak interactions is quite 
similar to that electromagnetism 
neutral component weak interactions 
even interfere electromagnetic 
interactions acts 
between charged particles 
charged weak interaction is 
force that change flavor matter 
particles 
even mediate between members 
different generations vertex 
there however major 
differences between electromagnetic 
weak interactions 
weak charge is a quantity 
two components, 
in contrast a single component 
electromagnetic charge, 
three components color charge 
weak charge is called weak 
isospin analogy to spin 
one characterizes particles total 
weak isospin third component 
determine coupling 
constants g 
g together 
electromagnetic coupling e 
weak force is transmitted vector 
bosons, similar to photon 
gluon, heavy 
w mass is order gev, 
that z order gev 
two bosons carry 
weak isospin, 
thus interact among 
in addition, charged bosons 
obviously interact photon 
weak interactions also 
conserve parity 
thus, produce polarization phenomena 
even nonpolarized initial states 
this explains first part small 
print bottom this table 
this nonconservation parity is 
visible example symmetries, 
respected interactions, 
weak interactions 
weak interactions even 
respect combined cp symmetry, 
therefore known 
interaction distinguishes between 
matter antimatter 
we will discuss this in video 
time, maybe even 
reason, 
interactions connect particles 
different generations a single vertex 
thus conserve flavor 
this fact is well established quarks 
also observed 
leptons we will see in video 
, respectively 
let us first discuss discovery 
parity nonconservation in charged 
weak interactions 
in , based study 
experimental data obtained 
cs wu, lee yang concluded that 
weak interactions invariant 
operation parity 
in order to investigate behavior 
this transformation, wu 
colleagues designed an experiment 
that remains a classic discipline 
uses beta decay neutrons n p e nuebar bound in co nuclei 
low temperature 
order kelvin 
in presence a magnetic field, 
spin vectors nuclei j 
strongly aligned 
magnetic field direction 
decay, 
co j ni j 
lead to two spin configurations 
p e denote momentum 
energy emitted electron, 
sigma denotes a unit vector in 
direction spin nucleus 
in case a shown top, 
electron is emitted in direction 
opposite to co spin 
in case b, is emitted in 
direction initial spin 
combination 
two cases is allowed 
conservation angular momentum 
experiment showed angular 
distribution case a exclusively 
admit a contribution, 
however small, configuration b 
this corresponds to a maximum 
violation parity 
indeed, conservation parity 
would imply that probabilities 
two configurations a 
b 
this also means that 
charged weak interactions 
admit a certain spin direction 
participating fermions 
in example, two spins 
electron neutrino must aligned 
that nucleus to 
conserve total angular momentum 
in case a, electron spin is 
antiparallel to direction motion 
antineutrino spin is parallel 
so we find that electron 
negative helicity, is left handed 
antilepton positive helicity, 
is right handed 
this property charged weak 
interactions generalized 
far we know, w 
interacts lefthanded fermions, 
fermions negative helicity 
righthanded antifermions, 
antifermions positive helicity 
charged weak interactions thus 
violate parity to a maximum extent 
consequently, we assign lefthanded 
leptons to doublets weak isospin 
righthanded leptons to singlets 
in this way, lefthanded matter 
fields carry a weak charge 
coupled to w z 
righthanded matter fields 
in manner, 
quarks assigned to doublets 
singlets according to helicity 
antimatter fields, 
opposite is true 
righthanded antileptons 
antiquark carry weak isospin 
lefthanded ones 
w z belong to 
a triplet weak isospin 
therefore 
interact among 
in addition, w obviously 
carries an electromagnetic charge 
interact a photon 
weak interactions conserve weak 
isospin that fundamental 
weak interaction vertices 
matter shown this graph 
here, l denotes a generic charged lepton 
nul a neutrino flavor 
q is an uptype quark 
q is a downtype quark 
exact definitions we will reserve 
later 
w interactions change one unit 
so a charged lepton is 
transformed a neutrino 
an uptype quark is transformed 
a downtype quark vice versa 
attention, emitted quarks 
neutrinos necessarily 
belong to generation 
interaction z boson keeps 
conserves flavor 
in next video, we will present 
a prototype w interactions, 
namely muon tau lepton decay
