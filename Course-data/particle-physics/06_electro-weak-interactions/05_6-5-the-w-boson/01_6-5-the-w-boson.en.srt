00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:15,425
In this sixth module,
we are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:19,905
In this fifth video, we'll talk about
the properties of the W bosons,

4
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:25,805
which transmit the charged weak force and
are responsible for weak decays.

5
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:31,725
After following this video, you will know
the W couplings to matter and forces.

6
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,869
The mass of the W bosons and
the various ways to measure it.

7
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:42,669
In video 6.3, we already defined
the couplings of the W to matter.

8
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:48,312
And in video 6.4, we have reviewed
the method to measure the Fermi constant,

9
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,937
which applies to processes with
q^2 much smaller

10
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:54,230
than the square of the mass of W,

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,280
and thus defines the intensity of
weak interactions at low energy.

12
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,857
So now the question is how to
measure the mass of the W boson?

13
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:11,300
This is done using two different methods 
which are of comparable accuracy.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,897
The first method determines the mass by

15
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:19,700
measuring the energy threshold for the production 
of W pairs in e+e- annihilation.

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,750
We already noted that
the vector bosons W and

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,740
Z themselves carry electro-weak charges.

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,000
W± have an electric charge.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
And both W± and Z have a nonzero 
weak isospin.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,190
There is thus an interaction
vertex among

21
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,322
electroweak bosons with
the couplings indicated here.

22
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:49,330
These vertices fix the values of
electroweak couplings in a unique manner,

23
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:55,873
and at the same time for interaction
between bosons and between fermions and bosons.

24
00:01:55,873 --> 00:02:02,856
Charged bosons can then be produced
in pairs by e+ e- annihilation.

25
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:08,081
The position of the threshold for
W pair production and the shape of the cross

26
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:13,477
section at threshold determine the mass
of the W Boson with good precision

27
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:18,124
as done by the L3 experiment at the Large
Electron Positron collider.

28
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:22,376
A second method for
the mass determination is to measure

29
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:28,070
the four-momenta of the decay products and
form the invariant mass.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,820
Since the mass is
a relativistic invariant,

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,140
we do not need to produce the W at rest.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,580
For two-body decays at high energy,
this means measuring energy and

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,220
direction of the particles.

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,400
The example shows here an event of
a W+ decaying into a positron and

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,456
an electron-neutrino, seen by the ATLAS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

36
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:58,410
The high energy positron is
shown by the yellow track

37
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,390
in the central detector.

38
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,816
And the corresponding energy, the position
in the calorimeter also shown in yellow.

39
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:12,480
The neutrino, the second decay product of the W+ 
leaves no trace in the detector but

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,580
manifests itself as a missing energy and
momentum.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,075
Momentum balance is indeed only guaranteed
in the plane transverse to the beam,

42
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:28,895
because gluons and
quarks carry a variable fraction x_Bj

43
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:34,335
of the incident proton momentum,
as we discussed in module 5.

44
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:39,215
However, analyzing the kinematics in
the transverse plane alone allows for

45
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:43,730
a good precision
measurement of the W mass.

46
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,200
The results of the two methods
are in good agreement and

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,140
can be averaged because
they are independent.

48
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,570
The precision reached with threshold and
invariant mass methods is ten

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,780
times smaller than what can
obtained measuring a mass by a resonance,

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,595
as it is done for the Z mass measurement,
which we will see in the next video.

51
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:12,571
In fact, in the next video,
Martin will talk about the properties

52
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:17,387
of the Z bosons,
which transmit the weak neutral interaction.
