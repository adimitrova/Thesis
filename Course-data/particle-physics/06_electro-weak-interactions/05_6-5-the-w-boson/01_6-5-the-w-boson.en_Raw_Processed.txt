in this sixth module, 
we discussing weak interactions 
in this fifth video, well talk 
properties w bosons, 
transmit charged weak force 
responsible weak decays 
following this video, you will know 
w couplings to matter forces 
mass w bosons 
various ways to measure 
in video , we already defined 
couplings w to matter 
in video , we reviewed 
method to measure fermi constant, 
applies to processes 
q much smaller 
square mass w, 
thus defines intensity 
weak interactions low energy 
so question is to 
measure mass w boson 
this is done using two different methods 
comparable accuracy 
first method determines mass 
measuring energy threshold production 
w pairs in ee annihilation 
we already noted that 
vector bosons w 
z carry electroweak charges 
w an electric charge 
w z a nonzero 
weak isospin 
there is thus an interaction 
vertex among 
electroweak bosons 
couplings indicated here 
vertices fix values 
electroweak couplings in a unique manner, 
time interaction 
between bosons between fermions bosons 
charged bosons produced 
in pairs e e annihilation 
position threshold 
w pair production shape cross 
section threshold determine mass 
w boson good precision 
done l experiment large 
electron positron collider 
a second method 
mass determination is to measure 
fourmomenta decay products 
form invariant mass 
since mass is 
a relativistic invariant, 
we need to produce w rest 
twobody decays high energy, 
this means measuring energy 
direction particles 
example shows here an event 
a w decaying a positron 
an electronneutrino, seen atlas 
experiment large hadron collider 
high energy positron is 
shown yellow track 
in central detector 
corresponding energy, position 
in calorimeter also shown in yellow 
neutrino, second decay product w 
leaves trace in detector 
manifests a missing energy 
momentum 
momentum balance is indeed guaranteed 
in plane transverse to beam, 
gluons 
quarks carry a variable fraction xbj 
incident proton momentum, 
we discussed in module 
however, analyzing kinematics in 
transverse plane alone allows 
a good precision 
measurement w mass 
results two methods 
in good agreement 
averaged 
independent 
precision reached threshold 
invariant mass methods is ten 
times smaller 
obtained measuring a mass a resonance, 
is done z mass measurement, 
we will see in next video 
in fact, in next video, 
martin will talk properties 
z bosons, 
transmit weak neutral interaction
