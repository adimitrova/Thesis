in this sixth module, we discussing 
electroweak interactions 
higgs mechanism 
in this th video, 
we will encounter particle associated 
higgs field, higgs boson 
following this video, 
you know higgs boson 
is produced lhc, 
we identify production 
decay, is verified that 
properties required a higgs boson 
higgs field is a microscopic 
field that must quantized 
there is a particle corresponds to 
phi field, scalar higgs boson h 
properties known 
discovered, 
except that we didnt know whether 
existed, that we didnt know mass 
in particular, branching ratio 
different fermionantifermion 
bosonboson pairs fixed 
mass is known 
higgs boson produced 
a real particle a hadron collider, 
provided energy is sufficient 
this is 
first time case lhc 
here we show feynman diagrams 
production a higgs boson two protons, 
either quarks 
gluons in initial state 
existence higgs boson, 
h, confirmed in 
a spectacular way experiments 
atlas cms lhc in 
higgs boson production is detected, 
among methods, 
in invariant mass distribution 
photon pairs, pairs z bosons 
latter ones decay, in turn, 
leptonantilepton pairs, 
observed in detector 
a fourlepton event atlas 
experiment, four muons in final 
state, serves logo this course, 
so youve seen many times 
signal mass gev 
sticks clearly background 
production mechanisms 
involve higgs bosons 
left, you see invariant 
mass distributions two photons 
a peak gev, 
right you see invariant mass 
fourlepton system that comes 
a higgs decay zz pairs 
indeed, we here a second 
nice example particle mass 
measurement 
invariant mass decay products 
measurements two experiments 
lhc give compatible results 
combined 
this determines today mass 
higgs boson h to gev 
a precision mev, that is 
accurate to two parts per thousand 
this is a remarkable achievement 
experiments is fruit work 
thousands physicists 
engineers two decades 
experimental findings today 
summarized follows 
h is clearly 
a wellestablished new particle 
probability that background fluctuates 
upwards to simulate signal is 
order one to 
several hundred million 
is indeed a boson 
decays two photons 
probably spin zero 
couplings to different 
particles indeed proportional 
to apparent masses, 
here we show a summary 
results cms experiment 
particle 
coupling that is missing here 
is higgs coupling to itself, 
since higgs boson also 
responsible generating mass 
so that will come in future 
so, we sure already this point 
that h is indeed a higgs boson 
this, however, exclude 
existence bosons this type, 
obviously actively 
hunted experiments lhc 
in next module, anna will go 
details to search 
new phenomena in challenging 
environment a hadron collider 
if you want to know higgs 
mechanism working principles, 
i recommend three episodes 
excellent series minute physics 
perimeter institute in waterloo, 
canada 
you will easily find youtube 
to conclude discussion higgs 
boson, next video contains 
an interview one key people 
contributed to discovery
