in
this
sixth
module
,
we
are
discussing
electro-weak
interactions
and
the
higgs
mechanism
.
in
this
12th
video
,
we
will
encounter
the
particle
associated
with
the
higgs
field
,
the
higgs
boson
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
should
know
how
the
higgs
boson
is
produced
at
the
lhc
,
how
we
identify
its
production
and
decay
,
and
how
it
is
verified
that
it
has
the
properties
required
for
a
higgs
boson
.
the
higgs
field
is
a
microscopic
field
that
must
be
quantized
.
there
is
a
particle
which
corresponds
to
the
phi
field
,
the
scalar
higgs
boson
h0
.
all
its
properties
were
known
before
it
was
discovered
,
except
that
we
did
n't
know
whether
it
existed
,
and
that
we
did
n't
know
its
mass
.
in
particular
,
its
branching
ratio
into
different
fermion-antifermion
or
boson-boson
pairs
are
fixed
once
the
mass
is
known
.
the
higgs
boson
can
be
produced
as
a
real
particle
at
a
hadron
collider
,
provided
its
energy
is
sufficient
.
this
is
for
the
first
time
the
case
at
the
lhc
.
here
we
show
some
feynman
diagrams
for
the
production
of
a
higgs
boson
from
two
protons
,
either
by
quarks
or
by
gluons
in
the
initial
state
.
the
existence
of
the
higgs
boson
,
h0
,
has
been
confirmed
in
a
spectacular
way
by
the
experiments
atlas
and
cms
at
the
lhc
in
2012.
higgs
boson
production
is
detected
,
among
other
methods
,
in
the
invariant
mass
distribution
of
photon
pairs
,
or
pairs
of
z
bosons
.
the
latter
ones
decay
,
in
turn
,
into
lepton-antilepton
pairs
,
which
are
then
observed
in
the
detector
.
a
four-lepton
event
from
the
atlas
experiment
,
with
four
muons
in
the
final
state
,
serves
as
the
logo
of
this
course
,
so
you
've
seen
it
many
times
.
the
signal
at
the
mass
of
about
125
gev
sticks
out
clearly
above
the
background
of
other
production
mechanisms
which
do
not
involve
higgs
bosons
.
on
the
left
,
you
see
the
invariant
mass
distributions
of
two
photons
which
has
a
peak
at
125
gev
,
and
on
the
right
you
see
the
invariant
mass
of
the
four-lepton
system
that
comes
from
a
higgs
decay
into
z-z
pairs
.
indeed
,
we
have
here
a
second
nice
example
of
particle
mass
measurement
through
the
invariant
mass
of
its
decay
products
.
the
measurements
from
the
two
experiments
at
the
lhc
give
compatible
results
which
can
be
combined
.
and
this
determines
today
the
mass
of
the
higgs
boson
h0
to
be
125
gev
with
a
precision
of
about
250
mev
,
that
is
accurate
to
about
two
parts
per
thousand
.
this
is
a
remarkable
achievement
by
these
experiments
and
is
the
fruit
of
the
work
of
thousands
of
physicists
and
engineers
during
two
decades
.
the
experimental
findings
today
can
be
summarized
as
follows
.
the
h0
is
clearly
a
well-established
new
particle
.
the
probability
that
background
fluctuates
upwards
to
simulate
the
signal
is
of
the
order
of
one
to
several
hundred
million
.
it
is
indeed
a
boson
because
it
decays
into
two
photons
.
it
very
probably
has
spin
zero
.
its
couplings
to
different
particles
are
indeed
proportional
to
their
apparent
masses
,
as
they
should
.
here
we
show
a
summary
of
results
from
the
cms
experiment
.
the
only
particle
or
coupling
that
is
missing
here
is
the
higgs
coupling
to
itself
,
since
the
higgs
boson
should
also
be
responsible
for
generating
its
own
mass
.
so
that
will
come
in
the
future
.
so
,
we
are
sure
already
at
this
point
that
h0
is
indeed
a
higgs
boson
.
this
,
however
,
does
not
exclude
the
existence
of
other
bosons
of
this
type
,
which
are
obviously
actively
hunted
by
experiments
at
the
lhc
.
in
the
next
module
,
and
anna
will
go
into
more
details
about
how
to
search
for
new
phenomena
in
the
challenging
environment
of
a
hadron
collider
.
if
you
want
to
know
more
about
the
higgs
mechanism
and
its
working
principles
,
i
recommend
these
three
episodes
of
the
excellent
series
minute
physics
from
the
perimeter
institute
in
waterloo
,
canada
.
you
will
easily
find
them
on
youtube
.
to
conclude
our
discussion
of
the
higgs
boson
,
the
next
video
contains
an
interview
with
one
of
the
key
people
who
contributed
to
its
discovery
.
