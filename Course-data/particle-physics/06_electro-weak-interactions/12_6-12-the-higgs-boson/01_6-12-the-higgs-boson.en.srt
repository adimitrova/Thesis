2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,964
In this sixth module, we are discussing
electro-weak interactions and

3
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,140
the Higgs mechanism.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,501
In this 12th video,

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:22,526
we will encounter the particle associated
with the Higgs field, the Higgs boson.

6
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,961
After following this video,
you should know how the Higgs boson

7
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:29,079
is produced at the LHC,
how we identify its production and

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,611
decay, and how it is verified that it has
the properties required for a Higgs boson.

9
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:38,500
The Higgs field is a microscopic
field that must be quantized.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,810
There is a particle which corresponds to
the Phi field, the scalar Higgs boson H0.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,930
All its properties were known
before it was discovered,

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,010
except that we didn't know whether it
existed, and that we didn't know its mass.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,751
In particular, its branching ratio
into different fermion-antifermion or

14
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,991
boson-boson pairs are fixed
once the mass is known.

15
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,098
The Higgs boson can be produced as
a real particle at a hadron collider,

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,228
provided its energy is sufficient.

17
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,144
This is for
the first time the case at the LHC.

18
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:15,431
Here we show some Feynman diagrams for the 
production of a Higgs boson from two protons,

19
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:19,538
either by quarks or
by gluons in the initial state.

20
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:24,064
The existence of the Higgs boson,
H0, has been confirmed in

21
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:29,476
a spectacular way by the experiments
ATLAS and CMS at the LHC in 2012.

22
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,405
Higgs boson production is detected,
among other methods,

23
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:39,630
in the invariant mass distribution of
photon pairs, or pairs of Z bosons.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,933
The latter ones decay, in turn,
into lepton-antilepton pairs,

25
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,583
which are then observed in the detector.

26
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,680
A four-lepton event from the ATLAS
experiment, with four muons in the final

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,602
state, serves as the logo of this course,
so you've seen it many times.

28
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:59,191
The signal at the mass of about 125 GeV
sticks out clearly above the background of

29
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:02,758
other production mechanisms which
do not involve Higgs bosons.

30
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:07,692
On the left, you see the invariant
mass distributions of two photons

31
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:12,881
which has a peak at 125 GeV, and
on the right you see the invariant mass

32
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:18,009
of the four-lepton system that comes
from a Higgs decay into Z-Z pairs.

33
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,950
Indeed, we have here a second
nice example of particle mass

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,987
measurement through
the invariant mass of its decay products.

35
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,611
The measurements from the two experiments
at the LHC give compatible results which

36
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,502
can be combined.

37
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:38,834
And this determines today the mass of
the Higgs boson H0 to be 125 GeV with

38
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:44,681
a precision of about 250 MeV, that is
accurate to about two parts per thousand.

39
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,655
This is a remarkable achievement by these
experiments and is the fruit of the work

40
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,760
of thousands of physicists and
engineers during two decades.

41
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,162
The experimental findings today
can be summarized as follows.

42
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,959
The H0 is clearly
a well-established new particle.

43
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,770
The probability that background fluctuates
upwards to simulate the signal is of

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,468
the order of one to
several hundred million.

45
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:11,271
It is indeed a boson because
it decays into two photons.

46
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:13,978
It very probably has spin zero.

47
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:17,120
Its couplings to different
particles are indeed proportional

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,023
to their apparent masses, as they should.

49
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:22,843
Here we show a summary of
results from the CMS experiment.

50
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:24,436
The only particle or

51
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:29,404
coupling that is missing here
is the Higgs coupling to itself,

52
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:35,609
since the Higgs boson should also be
responsible for generating its own mass.

53
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,002
So that will come in the future.

54
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:42,858
So, we are sure already at this point
that H0 is indeed a Higgs boson.

55
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:47,188
This, however, does not exclude the
existence of other bosons of this type,

56
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:50,744
which are obviously actively
hunted by experiments at the LHC.

57
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:54,774
In the next module, and Anna will go into
more details about how to search for

58
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:58,626
new phenomena in the challenging
environment of a hadron collider.

59
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:04,545
If you want to know more about the Higgs
mechanism and its working principles,

60
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,640
I recommend these three episodes of
the excellent series Minute Physics from

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,240
the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo,
Canada.

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,634
You will easily find them on YouTube.

63
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:17,441
To conclude our discussion of the Higgs
boson, the next video contains

64
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,382
an interview with one of the key people
who contributed to its discovery.
