music 
in this sixth module, weve 
discussing weak interactions 
we turn to higgs mechanism 
in this th video we will introduce 
dynamic generation particle masses 
this mechanism 
following this video you will 
know to argue that mass cannot 
an intrinsic property particles 
is called mass 
dynamically generated 
higgs mechanism implements this 
interaction particles 
omnipresent higgs field 
finally you will know 
qualitatively particles evolve in 
a vacuum filled higgs field 
is mass an object 
there two phenomena connected to mass 
first, mass is property 
an object opposes to 
acceleration according to newtons law 
this is called inertial mass 
time, is property 
an object allows to 
attract bodies gravity 
this is called gravitational mass 
is equality two properties 
led einstein to formulate general 
relativity, theory 
gravitation known today 
is inertial 
mass is interest here, 
gravitational interaction is 
weak to matter subatomic level 
one measures mass a particle 
observing energy that takes to 
create rest observing 
invariant mass decay products, 
observing 
velocity a given energy 
is in fact this last property 
mass that we must retain 
mass is property that keeps particles 
moving speed light, 
matter energetic 
particle spectrum that you see in this 
graph is extremely large far 
matter is concerned, neutrino 
weighing order a 
millielectronvolt, to top mass, 
is gev 
this is also true forces, 
mass photon 
gluon is zero 
spectrum goes to z 
w mass gev, respectively 
we believed, probably also you, that 
mass elementary particles, quarks 
leptons, gauge bosons, 
one intrinsic properties, 
like electric charge, 
color, flavor, 
baryon lepton number 
this is true 
mass is product a dynamic process 
without mass 
ingredients universe would zero 
let us trace back origin 
mass across different scales 
ordinary matter, solids, 
liquids, gasses, mass 
is to a good approximation equal to 
sum masses atoms 
cohesive energy 
example in a crystal is between one 
ten electron volts per atom is 
small compared to mass atoms 
mass an atom is also pretty much 
equal to sum masses 
electrons nucleus 
atomic binding energy is order 
to ev per electron, 
small compared to mass nucleus 
this reasoning continues to 
true nuclear level 
nuclear mass is far 
sum masses 
nucleons, 
a important binding energy 
obviously we seen in module , 
binding energies order 
eight mev per nucleon, 
is still small compared to 
mass nucleon itself, 
is order 
gev volts 
in summary, mass matter 
in universe is dominated 
mass protons, neutrons, 
electrons populate 
scale nucleon 
this reasoning work 
proton neutron contain low 
mass quarks massless gluons 
nucleon mass is dominated 
binding energy, 
already a dynamic origin 
quarks electrons 
binding energy far 
we know pointlike particles 
substructure so 
there is binding energy involved 
so least could mass 
an intrinsic property 
answer is 
reason this is quite subtle 
fundamental time 
continuous symmetries closely 
linked to conservation 
a physical quantity noethers theorem 
you see amalie emmynoether 
this photograph 
in particular gauge symmetry, 
invariance observables relative 
to a local phase change field, 
is basis standard model 
electroweak strong interactions 
gauge symmetry is in fact necessary to 
ensure regularization infinities 
in field theory, allowing to 
absorb measured quantities 
without this possibility standard 
model would make predictions, yet 
agrees experiment everywhere 
hand, an intrinsic 
particle mass matter well 
forces violates gauge symmetry 
a massive field we 
freedom to change gauge 
in words, fact that 
generations matter in families 
a different non zero mass, 
fact that mz 
mw equal to photon mass, 
namely equal to zero, 
violate gauge symmetry 
consequently mass must come 
a dynamic process 
instead an intrinsic property 
that particles born 
we simply treat 
quark a heavy u quark 
z boson a heavy photon 
problem comes 
propagation probability heavy bosons 
probability amplitude exchange 
a zeromass photon between two 
vertices is proportional to q 
q fourmomentum photon 
this amplitude is thus inversely 
proportional to invariant mass squared 
virtual photon that 
a pole q , 
mass real photon 
amplitude gently tends to zero 
q going to infinity 
massive bosons, contrary, 
propagator amplitude is proportional 
to q m 
a pole q m 
ordinary reactions, this 
cause problems to first order, 
occur a fixed q 
however, this propagator causes serious 
problems higher order processes, 
in case two boson exchange 
shown in this feynman graph 
inside this square loop, 
conservation energy momentum 
limit circulating 
fourmomentum q one boson is 
compensated q 
to obtain full amplitude this 
process, one must integrate this 
internal momentum to infinity, 
this interval diverges 
is true propagator 
virtual fermion in loop 
a finite mass will make 
amplitude diverge 
intrinsic mass bosons 
fermions, destroyed gage symmetry 
theory, thus also makes unusable 
facts indeed intimately linked, 
shown hooft 
veltman, decorated 
nobel prize this discovery in 
this is case, however, 
if mass is a dynamical phenomenon 
higgs mechanism invokes a scalar 
field to keep particles moving 
speed light 
this way appear massive to us, 
even though arent 
if massive fields incompatible 
gauge symmetry, 
opposite also true 
symmetry breaking make 
an originally massless field massive 
to understand this intuitively, 
we use a mechanical analogy 
imagine an infinitely fine 
needle shown in this picture, 
momentum 
inertia axis 
we apply a coaxial force beyond 
elastic limit needle 
first, nothing will happen 
system remains in 
unstable equilibrium 
a small quantum fluctuation in 
crystal lattice needle, 
weakens in a random place, 
needle folds in a random direction 
cylindrical symmetry system 
spontaneously disappeared 
time, a moment inertia 
original axis appeared 
system acquired a kind 
mass 
in a quantum field theory, a similar 
effect occurs if ground state 
a system possess a symmetry 
that is present system in general 
let us consider a system 
a single complex field phi 
minimum energy 
energys plotted here 
a function real part phi 
imaginary part phi, 
minimum energy 
match phi , 
occurs states 
phi v, equal to 
ground state 
a system is vacuum, 
fields equal to , 
a space time filled phi everywhere 
if we want to a perturbative 
calculation in a vacuum, 
we need to choose minimum 
energy around we develop states 
choosing a specific value 
phi ground state 
phi v 
that is minimum energy 
one breaks symmetry 
respect to phase phi 
this is called spontaneous 
symmetry breaking 
time, field phi 
field interacting 
acquires mass 
we call a field phi a higgs field 
a particle move in a vacuum 
filled higgs field 
fields interact field 
phi a given coupling constant 
constantly kept moving freely 
propagate like in a viscous liquid 
speed is lower c 
a mass would in 
a real vacuum higgs field absent 
let demonstrate this effect 
a mechanical analogy 
i here two test tubes 
one filled water, 
one filled olive oil 
if we look balls falling 
liquid 
here there two balls in 
liquid, one is a clay ball 
one is a steel ball we course 
see that fall a different speed, 
a different 
interaction liquid 
porous surface clay ball 
makes fall much slower 
smooth steel ball 
so this would correspond to different 
particles moving in a viscous liquid, 
so that fall 
speed free fall 
if we change liquid, in words, 
if we make a stronger higgs field, 
balls will fall slowly 
is still true that individual 
speed, individual apparent mass, 
is given coupling to field, 
coupling to liquid 
so this is analogous to 
higgs mechanism 
strength interaction, strength 
presence higgs field is 
analogous to 
properties liquid 
coupling different particles to 
higgs field determine speed 
move, even though mass is zero 
so mass particles is given 
coupling constant higgs field 
is dynamically generated 
interactions this ubiquitous field 
in next video, we will discuss 
quanta higgs field, 
higgs bosons
