2
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,710
In this sixth module, we've been
discussing weak interactions and

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,259
we now turn to the Higg's mechanism.

4
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:20,390
In this 11th video we will introduce the
dynamic generation of particle masses by

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,100
this mechanism.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,100
After following this video you will
know how to argue that mass cannot be

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,810
an intrinsic property of particles.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,960
How what is called mass can be
dynamically generated and

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,550
how the Higgs mechanism implements this

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,840
through the interaction of particles
where the omnipresent Higgs field.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,320
And finally you will know
qualitatively how particles evolve in

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,610
a vacuum filled with the Higgs field.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,450
What is the mass of an object?

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,320
There are two phenomena connected to mass.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,370
First, mass is the property of
an object which opposes itself to

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,980
acceleration according to Newton's Law.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,750
This is called the inertial mass.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,070
At the same time, it is the property of

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,280
an object which allows it to
attract other bodies by gravity.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,890
This is called the gravitational mass.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,820
It is the equality of these two properties
which led Einstein to formulate general

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,330
relativity, the only theory
of gravitation known today.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,470
But it is only the inertial
mass which is of interest here,

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,590
the gravitational interaction is too
weak to matter at the subatomic level.

25
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,180
One measures the mass of a particle by
observing the energy that it takes to

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,950
create it at rest or by observing
the invariant mass of its decay products,

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,040
or by observing its
velocity at a given energy.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,380
It is in fact this last property
of the mass that we must retain.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,680
Mass is the property that keeps particles
from moving at the speed of light,

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,830
no matter how energetic they are.

31
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,694
The particle spectrum that you see in this
graph is extremely large both as far as

32
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:04,269
matter is concerned, with the neutrino
weighing on the order of a

33
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:09,373
milli-electronvolt, and up to the top mass,
which is about 170 GeV.

34
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:12,360
This is also true for forces,

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,340
where the mass of the photon and
of the gluon is zero.

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,870
And the spectrum goes up to the Z and
W mass of 90 and 80 GeV, respectively.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,070
We believed, me and probably also you, that
the mass of elementary particles, quarks

38
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,830
and leptons, and gauge bosons,
was one of their intrinsic properties,

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,900
like the electric charge,
the color, the flavor,

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,300
the baryon and the lepton number. 
But this is not true.

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,740
Mass is the product of a dynamic process

42
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,140
without which the mass of all the
ingredients of the universe would be zero.

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,300
Let us trace back the origin of
mass across different scales.

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,700
For ordinary matter, solids,
liquids, and gasses, the mass

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,850
is to a good approximation equal to
the sum of the masses of the atoms.

46
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,820
The cohesive energy for
example in a crystal is between one and

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,620
ten electron volts per atom which is
small compared to the mass of the atoms.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,090
The mass of an atom is also pretty much
equal to the sum of the masses of its

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,100
electrons and its nucleus.

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,750
The atomic binding energy is of the order
of 5 to 25 eV per electron,

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,890
small compared to the mass of the nucleus.

52
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,940
This reasoning continues to
be true at the nuclear level.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,770
The nuclear mass is not far below
the sum of the masses

54
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,690
of its nucleons, but

55
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,560
with a more important binding energy
obviously. As we have seen in module 2,

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,510
the binding energies of the order of
eight MeV per nucleon,

57
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,000
but it is still small compared to
the mass of the nucleon itself,

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,047
which is of the order
of GeV volts.

59
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,440
In summary, the mass of the matter
in the universe is dominated

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,190
by the mass of the protons, the neutrons,
and the electrons which populate it.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,750
But at the scale of the nucleon
itself this reasoning does not work.

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,070
Proton and neutron contain low
mass quarks and massless gluons.

63
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,925
The nucleon mass is dominated
by their binding energy,

64
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,690
it already has a dynamic origin.

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,160
But quarks and electrons do not have
binding energy because they are as far as

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,720
we know point-like particles.

67
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,710
They have no substructure so
there is no binding energy involved.

68
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,270
So at least for them could mass
not be an intrinsic property?

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,510
The answer is no.

70
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,590
And the reason for this is quite subtle
and fundamental at the same time.

71
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,530
Continuous symmetries are closely
linked to the conservation of

72
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,690
a physical quantity by Noether's theorem.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,380
You see Amalie Emmy Noether
on this photograph.

74
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,300
In particular gauge symmetry,

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,160
the invariance of observables relative
to a local phase change of the field,

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,101
is the basis of the standard model of
electro-weak and strong interactions.

77
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:58,396
Gauge symmetry is in fact necessary to
ensure the regularization of infinities

78
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:03,580
in the field theory, allowing to
absorb them into measured quantities.

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,950
Without this possibility the standard
model would not make any predictions, yet

80
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,040
it agrees with experiment everywhere.

81
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,940
On the other hand, an intrinsic
particle mass –for matter as well as for

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,130
forces – violates gauge symmetry.

83
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,450
For a massive field we do not have
the freedom to change its gauge.

84
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,899
In other words, the fact that all
generations of matter in all families

85
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,210
have a different and non zero mass,

86
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,160
and the fact that M_Z and
M_W are not equal to the photon mass,

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,730
namely not equal to zero,
violate gauge symmetry.

88
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,240
Consequently mass must come
from a dynamic process

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,430
instead of being an intrinsic property
that particles are born with.

90
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,640
Why can we not simply treat the t
quark as a heavy u quark and

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,130
the Z boson as a heavy photon?

92
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,430
The problem comes from
the propagation probability of heavy bosons.

93
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,967
The probability amplitude for the exchange
of a zero-mass photon between two

94
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:05,518
vertices is proportional to 1/q^2
with q the four-momentum of the photon.

95
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:09,562
This amplitude is thus inversely
proportional to the invariant mass squared

96
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:12,732
of the virtual photon that has
a pole at q^2 = 0,

97
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,240
the mass of the real photon.

98
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,990
The amplitude gently tends to zero for
q^2 going to infinity.

99
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,375
For massive bosons, on the contrary,

100
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:27,240
the propagator amplitude is proportional
to 1/(q^2 - M^2).

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,770
It has a pole at q^2 = M^2.

102
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,820
For ordinary reactions, this does
not cause problems to first order,

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,089
because they occur at a fixed q^2.

104
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,640
However, this propagator causes serious
problems for higher order processes,

105
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,520
as in the case of two boson exchange
shown in this Feynman graph.

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Inside this square loop,

107
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,200
conservation of energy momentum
does not limit the circulating

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,490
four-momentum. Any q of one boson is
compensated by -q of the other.

109
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,090
To obtain the full amplitude of this
process, one must integrate over this

110
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,609
internal momentum to infinity,
and this interval diverges.

111
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,384
The same is true for the propagator
of the virtual fermion in the loop.

112
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,620
A finite mass will make
the amplitude diverge.

113
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,155
The intrinsic mass of bosons and

114
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:20,720
fermions, which destroyed the gage symmetry
of the theory, thus also makes it unusable.

115
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,360
Both facts are indeed intimately linked,
as was shown by 't Hooft and

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,330
Veltman, which were decorated by the
Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1999.

117
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,360
This is not the case, however,
if mass is a dynamical phenomenon.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,040
The Higgs mechanism invokes a scalar
field to keep particles from moving at

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,940
the speed of light.

120
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,240
This way they appear massive to us,
even though they aren't.

121
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,600
If massive fields are incompatible
with the gauge symmetry, then

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,130
the opposite should also be true.

123
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,210
Symmetry breaking should make
an originally massless field massive.

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,713
To understand this intuitively,
we again use a mechanical analogy.

125
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:05,896
Imagine an infinitely fine
needle as shown in this picture,

126
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:09,020
it has no momentum of
inertia about its axis.

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,349
Now we apply a coaxial force beyond
the elastic limit of the needle.

128
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,490
At first, nothing will happen.

129
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,550
The system remains in
unstable equilibrium.

130
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,470
Through a small quantum fluctuation in
the crystal lattice of the needle,

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,460
it weakens in a random place, and
the needle folds in a random direction.

132
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,360
The cylindrical symmetry of the system
has spontaneously disappeared.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,200
At the same time, a moment of inertia
about the original axis has appeared.

134
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,095
The system has acquired a kind
of mass it did not have before.

135
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,762
In a quantum field theory, a similar
effect occurs if the ground state

136
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:54,849
of a system does not possess a symmetry
that is present for the system in general.

137
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,540
Let us consider a system with
a single complex field Phi

138
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,050
where the minimum of the energy.

139
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,800
The energy's plotted here as
a function of the real part of Phi and

140
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,920
the imaginary part of Phi,

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,380
where the minimum of energy does
not match Phi= 0,

142
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,480
but occurs for all states with 
Phi^2 = v, not equal to 0.

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,000
The ground state of such
a system is not the vacuum,

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,980
with all fields equal to 0, but
a space time filled with Phi everywhere.

145
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,390
If we want to do a perturbative
calculation in such a vacuum,

146
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,700
we need to choose the minimum of the
energy around which we develop the states.

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,840
By choosing a specific value
of Phi as the ground state

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,480
– with Phi^2 = v because
that is the minimum of the energy –

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,690
one breaks the symmetry with
respect to the phase of Phi.

150
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,680
This is called spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,820
At the same time, the field Phi itself and

152
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,170
any other field interacting
with it acquires mass.

153
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,470
We call such a field Phi a Higgs field.

154
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,720
How does a particle move in a vacuum
filled with the Higgs field?

155
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,940
All fields which interact with the field
Phi with a given coupling constant

156
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,849
are constantly kept from moving freely.

157
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,440
They propagate like in a viscous liquid.

158
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,099
Their speed is lower than c.

159
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:21,070
They have a mass they would not have in
a real vacuum with the Higgs field absent.

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,250
Let me demonstrate this effect
by again a mechanical analogy.

161
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,340
I have here two test tubes.

162
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,650
One filled with water,
one filled with olive oil.

163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,710
If we look at balls falling
through the liquid

164
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,910
– here there are two balls in
the liquid, one is a clay ball

165
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,500
the other one is a steel ball – we of course
see that they fall with a different speed,

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,100
because they have a different
interaction with the liquid.

167
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,870
The porous surface of the clay ball
makes it fall much slower than

168
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,760
the smooth steel ball.

169
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,180
So this would correspond to different
particles moving in a viscous liquid,

170
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,060
so that they do not fall
at the speed of free fall.

171
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,310
If we change the liquid, in other words,
if we make a stronger Higgs field,

172
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,990
both balls will fall more slowly but

173
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,480
it is still true that their individual
speed, their individual apparent mass,

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,709
is given by their coupling to the field,
by the coupling to the liquid.

175
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,920
So this is analogous to
the Higgs mechanism.

176
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,940
The strength of interaction, the strength
of presence of the Higgs field is

177
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,120
analogous to
the properties of the liquid and

178
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,000
the coupling of the different particles to
the Higgs field determine with what speed

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,080
they move, even though their mass is zero.

180
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,280
So the mass of particles is given by their
coupling constant with the Higgs field.

181
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,190
It is dynamically generated through
interactions with this ubiquitous field.

182
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,327
In the next video, we will discuss
the quanta of the Higgs field,

183
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,417
the Higgs bosons.

184
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:16,819
