in this sixth module, 
we discussing weak interactions 
in this nineth video, we talk 
neutrinos particles 
that interact exclusively 
weak interactions 
following this video, you will know 
basic properties neutrinos 
fabulously small 
crosssection mater 
processes involving neutrinos 
due to weak interactions neutrinos 
carry neither electric 
color charge 
process weak neutral 
interactions discovered 
is elastic scattering 
neutrinos electrons, 
namely nu e nu e 
this picture taken 
a gargamelle bubble chamber cern 
documents first 
observation this reaction type 
is in fact first observation 
a weak neutrino current event 
neutrino enters left 
interacts an atomic 
electron liquid 
a single visible track leaves 
interaction vertex 
is due to a minimum ionizing particle 
shown low bubble density 
particle also causes bremsstrahlung 
is therefore clearly an electron 
bremsstrahlung photon is 
converted an e e pair 
since observation this reaction, 
neutrino become a precious tool 
study weak interactions, 
particularly interactions z 
w matter 
energies much lower 
z boson mass, 
crosssection depends coupling 
constants gv ga electron 
neutrino we 
fixed to onehalf 
coupling constants already 
discussed defined in video 
crosssection is valid 
neutrinos second 
third generation, 
that is to say nu nutau 
antineutrino, crosssection 
is indicated lower equation 
differs neutrino crosssection 
in sign interference term 
between vector 
axialvector contributions 
neutrino electron crosssections 
extremely small 
proportionality to 
enu comes 
total energy available in initial 
state s, is pk, 
in approximation 
zero neutrino mass, 
is two times energy neutrino 
times mass electron 
this proportionality is regularized 
high energy z propagator 
hidden in fermi constant, gf 
gev, crosssections 
order attobarn 
rates thus desperately low 
obviously, neutrino also 
interact quarks 
exchange a z boson 
this image taken 
gargamelle bubble chamber 
in cern neutrino beam 
here we show original 
negative picture 
neutrino 
enters left 
interacts this time 
a proton liquid 
there three hadrons 
coming vertex, 
two positively charged 
one negative, shown curvature 
tracks in magnetic field 
proton in middle interacts 
a nucleus liquid, 
pions slowed 
dedx absorbed 
neutrino escapes 
without leaving a track 
neutrinos also interact via w exchange 
in charged weak interactions, like 
in this example 
neutrino 
enters left 
interacts this time a neutron 
a leaves chamber 
minimal ionization 
a highly ionizing proton 
is visible vertex 
a decays two photons 
in turn converted 
e e pairs 
two charged pions interact 
liquid strong force 
produce hadrons 
you see examples that bubble 
chamber images contain a lot 
information graphical 
easily interpreted to 
identify reaction final state 
in fact, photos this type 
awakened fascination 
particle physics in 
this analog technology is 
course longer used today 
we seen that 
neutrinoelectron interactions, 
crosssection is proportional 
to neutrino energy 
this is true in general to purely 
leptonic interactions between 
neutrinos quarks charged, 
well neutral current interactions 
here you see compilation 
particle data group neutrino 
antineutrino charged 
current crosssections, 
divided neutrino energy to 
better appreciate proportionality 
you may wonder if point, 
a crosssection 
that increases energy will 
violate unitarity limit 
indeed, neutrino crosssections 
regularized propagator w 
z boson high q 
to see this effect propagator, 
we need fabulously high energies beyond 
ev in laboratory 
frame, that is to say , tev 
this graph shows a calculation 
crosssection high energy 
z resonance is clearly visible 
reactions involve an 
schannel z exchange 
beyond resonance, propagator 
regularizes cross sections that 
will eventually tend to 
reactions involving w 
exchange in tchannel, 
regularization takes much higher energy, 
since a small fraction 
neutrino energy 
is transmitted to target 
in next video, 
we will discuss oscillations 
between different neutrino species
