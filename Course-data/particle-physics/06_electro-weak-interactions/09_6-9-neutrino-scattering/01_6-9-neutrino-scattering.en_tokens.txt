in
this
sixth
module
,
we
are
discussing
weak
interactions
.
and
in
this
nineth
video
,
we
talk
about
neutrinos
which
are
the
only
particles
that
interact
exclusively
by
weak
interactions
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
basic
properties
of
neutrinos
and
their
fabulously
small
cross-section
with
mater
.
the
processes
involving
neutrinos
are
only
due
to
weak
interactions
because
neutrinos
carry
neither
electric
nor
color
charge
.
the
process
through
which
weak
neutral
interactions
have
been
discovered
is
the
elastic
scattering
of
neutrinos
off
electrons
,
namely
nu_Ã¢Âµ
e-
-
>
nu_Ã¢Âµ
e-
.
this
picture
taken
with
a
gargamelle
bubble
chamber
at
cern
the
1973
documents
the
first
observation
of
this
reaction
type
.
it
is
in
fact
the
very
first
observation
of
a
weak
neutrino
current
event
.
the
neutrino
enters
from
the
left
and
interacts
with
an
atomic
electron
of
the
liquid
.
a
single
visible
track
leaves
from
the
interaction
vertex
.
it
is
due
to
a
minimum
ionizing
particle
as
shown
by
the
low
bubble
density
.
the
particle
also
causes
bremsstrahlung
.
it
is
therefore
clearly
an
electron
.
the
bremsstrahlung
photon
is
then
converted
into
an
e+
e-
pair
.
since
the
observation
of
this
reaction
,
the
neutrino
has
become
a
precious
tool
for
the
study
of
weak
interactions
,
particularly
the
interactions
of
the
z
and
w
with
matter
.
for
energies
much
lower
than
the
z
boson
mass
,
the
cross-section
depends
on
the
coupling
constants
g_v
and
g_a
of
the
electron
.
those
of
the
neutrino
we
have
fixed
to
one-half
.
these
coupling
constants
have
already
been
discussed
and
defined
in
video
6.6.
the
cross-section
is
valid
for
neutrinos
of
the
second
and
of
the
third
generation
,
that
is
to
say
nu_Ã¢Âµ
and
nu_tau
.
for
the
anti-neutrino
,
the
cross-section
is
indicated
by
the
lower
equation
.
it
differs
from
the
neutrino
cross-section
in
the
sign
of
the
interference
term
between
the
vector
and
axialvector
contributions
.
neutrino
electron
cross-sections
are
extremely
small
.
the
proportionality
to
e_nu
comes
from
the
total
energy
available
in
the
initial
state
s
,
which
is
(
p+k
)
^2
,
or
in
the
approximation
of
zero
neutrino
mass
,
it
is
two
times
energy
of
the
neutrino
times
the
mass
of
the
electron
.
this
proportionality
is
regularized
at
high
energy
by
the
z
propagator
hidden
in
the
fermi
constant
,
g_f
.
at
1
gev
,
the
cross-sections
are
of
order
attobarn
.
the
rates
are
thus
desperately
low
.
obviously
,
the
neutrino
can
also
interact
with
quarks
through
the
exchange
of
a
z
boson
.
this
image
was
taken
with
the
same
gargamelle
bubble
chamber
in
the
cern
neutrino
beam
.
here
we
show
the
original
negative
picture
.
the
neutrino
again
enters
from
the
left
and
interacts
this
time
with
a
proton
of
the
liquid
.
there
are
three
hadrons
coming
out
of
the
vertex
,
two
positively
charged
and
one
negative
,
as
shown
by
the
curvature
of
the
tracks
in
the
magnetic
field
.
the
proton
in
the
middle
interacts
with
a
nucleus
of
the
liquid
,
both
pions
are
slowed
down
by
de/dx
and
absorbed
.
the
neutrino
escapes
without
leaving
a
track
.
neutrinos
also
interact
via
w
exchange
in
charged
weak
interactions
,
like
in
this
example
.
the
neutrino
once
again
enters
from
the
left
and
interacts
this
time
with
a
neutron
.
a
Ã¢Âµ-
leaves
the
chamber
with
minimal
ionization
.
a
highly
ionizing
proton
is
visible
at
the
vertex
.
a
Ã¯Â0
decays
into
two
photons
which
in
turn
are
converted
into
e+
e-
pairs
.
the
two
charged
pions
interact
with
the
liquid
by
the
strong
force
and
produce
other
hadrons
.
you
see
by
these
examples
that
bubble
chamber
images
contain
a
lot
of
information
and
are
very
graphical
.
they
are
easily
interpreted
to
identify
the
reaction
and
the
final
state
.
in
fact
,
photos
of
this
type
which
awakened
my
fascination
with
particle
physics
in
the
1970s
.
but
this
analog
technology
is
of
course
no
longer
used
today
.
we
had
seen
that
for
neutrino-electron
interactions
,
the
cross-section
is
proportional
to
the
neutrino
energy
.
this
is
true
in
general
to
both
for
purely
leptonic
and
for
interactions
between
neutrinos
and
quarks
.
and
for
charged
,
as
well
as
for
neutral
current
interactions
.
here
you
see
the
compilation
of
the
particle
data
group
of
neutrino
and
antineutrino
charged
current
cross-sections
,
divided
by
the
neutrino
energy
to
better
appreciate
the
proportionality
.
you
may
wonder
if
at
some
point
,
a
cross-section
that
increases
with
energy
will
not
violate
the
unitarity
limit
.
indeed
,
the
neutrino
cross-sections
are
regularized
by
the
propagator
of
the
w
and
z
boson
and
very
high
q^2
.
but
to
see
this
effect
of
the
propagator
,
we
need
fabulously
high
energies
beyond
10^15
ev
in
the
laboratory
frame
,
that
is
to
say
1,000
tev
.
this
graph
shows
a
calculation
of
the
cross-section
at
very
high
energy
.
the
z
resonance
is
clearly
visible
for
reactions
which
involve
an
s-channel
z
exchange
.
beyond
the
resonance
,
the
propagator
regularizes
the
cross
sections
such
that
it
will
eventually
tend
to
0
as
it
should
.
for
reactions
involving
w
exchange
in
the
t-channel
,
regularization
takes
much
higher
energy
,
since
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
neutrino
energy
is
transmitted
to
the
target
.
in
the
next
video
,
we
will
discuss
oscillations
between
different
neutrino
species
.
