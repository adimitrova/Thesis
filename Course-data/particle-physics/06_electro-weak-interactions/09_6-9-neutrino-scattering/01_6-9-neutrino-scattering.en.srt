2
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:13,017
In this sixth module,
we are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:16,939
And in this nineth video, we talk about
neutrinos which are the only particles

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:19,550
that interact exclusively
by weak interactions.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,140
After following this video, you will know
the basic properties of neutrinos and

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,535
their fabulously small
cross-section with mater.

7
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:33,938
The processes involving neutrinos are only
due to weak interactions because neutrinos

8
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:37,020
carry neither electric nor
color charge.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,790
The process through which weak neutral
interactions have been discovered

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,090
is the elastic scattering
of neutrinos off electrons,

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,370
namely nu_µ e- -> nu_µ e-. 

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,730
This picture taken with
a Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,210
the 1973 documents the first
observation of this reaction type.

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,730
It is in fact the very first observation
of a weak neutrino current event.

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,380
The neutrino enters from the left and

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,450
interacts with an atomic
electron of the liquid.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,170
A single visible track leaves
from the interaction vertex.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,130
It is due to a minimum ionizing particle
as shown by the low bubble density.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,190
The particle also causes bremsstrahlung.

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,280
It is therefore clearly an electron.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,380
The bremsstrahlung photon is then
converted into an e+ e- pair.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,637
Since the observation of this reaction,

23
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:32,762
the neutrino has become a precious tool
for the study of weak interactions,

24
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:35,936
particularly the interactions of the Z and
W with matter.

25
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:40,572
For energies much lower
than the Z boson mass,

26
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:45,840
the cross-section depends on the coupling
constants g_V and g_A of the electron.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,930
Those of the neutrino we
have fixed to one-half.

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,497
These coupling constants have already
been discussed and defined in video 6.6.

29
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:59,110
The cross-section is valid for
neutrinos of the second and

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,000
of the third generation,
that is to say nu_µ and nu_tau.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,219
For the anti-neutrino, the cross-section
is indicated by the lower equation.

32
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,520
It differs from the neutrino cross-section
in the sign of the interference term

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,670
between the vector and
axialvector contributions.

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,360
Neutrino electron cross-sections
are extremely small.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,510
The proportionality to
E_nu comes from

36
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,740
the total energy available in the initial
state s, which is (p+k)^2,

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,980
or in the approximation
of zero neutrino mass,

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,170
it is two times energy of the neutrino
times the mass of the electron.

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,720
This proportionality is regularized
at high energy by the Z propagator

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,270
hidden in the Fermi constant, G_F.

41
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,813
At 1 GeV, the cross-sections are 
of order attobarn.

42
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,890
The rates are thus desperately low.

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,944
Obviously, the neutrino can also
interact with quarks through

44
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,855
the exchange of a Z boson.

45
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:58,895
This image was taken with the same
Gargamelle bubble chamber

46
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,325
in the CERN neutrino beam.

47
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,585
Here we show the original
negative picture.

48
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,905
The neutrino again
enters from the left and

49
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:09,110
interacts this time with
a proton of the liquid.

50
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,680
There are three hadrons
coming out of the vertex,

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,100
two positively charged and

52
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,140
one negative, as shown by the curvature
of the tracks in the magnetic field.

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,960
The proton in the middle interacts
with a nucleus of the liquid,

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,680
both pions are slowed down
by dE/dx and absorbed.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,860
The neutrino escapes
without leaving a track.

56
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,989
Neutrinos also interact via W exchange
in charged weak interactions, like

57
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,200
in this example.

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,100
The neutrino once again
enters from the left and

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,570
interacts this time with a neutron.

60
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,010
A µ- leaves the chamber
with minimal ionization.

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,450
A highly ionizing proton
is visible at the vertex.

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,820
A π0 decays into two photons
which in turn are converted

63
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,960
into e+ e- pairs.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,120
The two charged pions interact with
the liquid by the strong force and

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,250
produce other hadrons.

66
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,070
You see by these examples that bubble
chamber images contain a lot of

67
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,500
information and are very graphical.

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,681
They are easily interpreted to
identify the reaction and the final state.

69
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:22,091
In fact, photos of this type which
awakened my fascination with

70
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,570
particle physics in the 1970s.

71
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,500
But this analog technology is
of course no longer used today.

72
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,102
We had seen that for
neutrino-electron interactions,

73
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:37,770
the cross-section is proportional
to the neutrino energy.

74
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,780
This is true in general to both for purely
leptonic and for interactions between

75
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,530
neutrinos and quarks. And for charged, as
well as for neutral current interactions.

76
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,350
Here you see the compilation of
the particle data group of neutrino and

77
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,780
antineutrino charged
current cross-sections,

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,680
divided by the neutrino energy to
better appreciate the proportionality.

79
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:04,995
You may wonder if at some point,
a cross-section

80
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:08,275
that increases with energy will
not violate the unitarity limit.

81
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:13,355
Indeed, the neutrino cross-sections are
regularized by the propagator of the W and

82
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,475
Z boson and very high q^2.

83
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,920
But to see this effect of the propagator,
we need fabulously high energies beyond 

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,290
10^15 eV in the laboratory
frame, that is to say 1,000 TeV.

85
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,590
This graph shows a calculation of
the cross-section at very high energy.

86
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,450
The Z resonance is clearly visible for

87
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,860
reactions which involve an
s-channel Z exchange.

88
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,810
Beyond the resonance, the propagator
regularizes the cross sections such that it

89
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,500
will eventually tend to 0 as it should.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,290
For reactions involving W
exchange in the t-channel,

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,270
regularization takes much higher energy,

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,900
since only a small fraction
of the neutrino energy

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,520
is transmitted to the target.

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,182
In the next video,

95
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:02,974
we will discuss oscillations
between different neutrino species.
