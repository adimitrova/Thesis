music 
music in this module, 
we discussing properties 
electroweak interactions 
in this video we will 
visit atlas experiment, 
whose visitor center is behind 
atlas is an experiment installed 
large hadron collider lhc cern 
in video a 
we already introduced full 
range cerns accelerators 
in video a, we discussed 
properties atlas detector 
today we will talk 
one active participants 
in discovery higgs boson, 
is sandrine laplace 
follow please 
i will quickly present to you 
interview partner today, 
is sandrine laplace 
sandrine obtained phd in 
laboratoire dacclrateur linaire lal 
in orsay, close to paris 
a subject cp violation 
joined laboratoire dannecy de la 
physique des particules, lapp, 
close to here, km geneva, 
to join atlas experiment, 
to lapp contributes in a major way 
in , if i remember correctly, 
joined laboratoire de physique 
nuclaire et des hautes nergies, 
lpnhe in paris, still works today, 
always atlas experiment, 
is subject today 
so, sandrine, you still remember 
you first heard 
higgs mechanism 
higgs boson 
yes, i remember 
university, a course 
i imagine, i hope so 
well, a course called 
dea time, 
in fifth year in france 
indeed in a field theory course, 
that is i think i first 
heard higgs mechanism 
higgs boson 
you 
think that time 
this somewhat complex mechanism 
indeed, time, seemed 
complex to 
a student, one a 
sort intuition 
example mass 
a particle could 
one day, someone explains that 
is complicated that 
in fact, that mass exist 
yes, so i remember that i found 
this pretty complicated 
a property that seemed 
simple to 
in addition, 
theoretical time, 
since in context a course 
became somewhat concrete, 
phd, 
while i worked a totally different subject, 
in year 
indeed 
lapp there excitement 
a possible signal 
yes, a possible indirect signal 
higgs mechanism 
in fact indirectly, 
radiative corrections, 
that one found that existence 
this effect totally excluded, 
that even relatively probable, 
directly accessible to 
that generation experiments 
that one reason 
we built lhc 
this also count among 
motivations to join atlas 
experiment lhc, time 
yes, absolutely 
i not, that time 
consciously tell that 
i will join atlas this 
reason 
but, i arrived in 
atlas collaboration, 
appeared perfectly natural to 
work this subject, indeed 
so role 
construction atlas 
so i joined atlas in 
in , detector almost 
completely constructed 
so, i arrived lapp annecy, 
involved in construction 
a subdetector, is called 
electromagnetic calorimeter, 
serves to measure energy 
electrons photons 
so, quite naturally, i joined 
this activity, that moment 
detector construction 
already finished 
we exposed modules 
to particle beams cern 
to test final modules, 
determine performance 
so, i participated in that, 
in 
calorimeter lowered 
cavern, 
electronics pugged in, 
i think this in 
on, 
until start lhc, 
in , we able to study 
electromagnetic calorimeter, to make sure 
that worked well in cavern, that 
ready first collisions 
so, i participated a lot in this 
commissioning detector, we call 
this detector evidently 
played a major role 
throughout history 
this discovery 
so you decide to get involved 
in data analysis 
led to discovery this particle 
well, early on, 
working electromagnetic 
calorimeter, natural to 
look a physics reaction that 
involved this detector 
so, i got interested quickly in 
search higgs boson in channel 
decays two photons 
actually one two 
channels we first saw 
higgs boson 
one discovery channels 
evidently, this discovery 
happen in one day 
a long sequence events 
you recall us 
you lived this race discovery 
indeed, this happened progressively 
we started to take data 
in 
little 
became interesting in , 
we really arrived an energy 
tev in centerofmass frame 
that is we started to accumulate data 
way we worked 
that we regularly watched, 
every few weeks, 
distribution photon pairs 
we able to reconstruct 
invariant mass distribution 
yes, invariant mass distribution, indeed, 
photon pairs 
then, we waited to see if 
photons could come higgs boson, 
that mass starts to 
peak around 
higgs boson mass 
that started to 
case gently 
that is to say, really happened 
gradually 
beginning, 
we much data, 
we saw fluctuations everywhere 
so, we know much 
then, a certain moment, there 
one fluctuations, started 
to somehow deepen 
stayed always in place 
indeed, week week, 
always there, larger larger, 
in a regular manner 
then, a certain moment, we learned 
that colleagues experiment, 
worked another higgs decay channel, 
one leptons, 
saw a fluctuation, started to 
grow place like 
so, this moment, we started to 
you started to believe 
yes, to believe 
exactly in december , 
there a seminar 
here 
yes, here cern, 
first time 
we announced that we started to see 
premise higgs boson 
evidence weak time 
to really announce a discovery 
there serious premise, 
confirmed july , 
we really announced discovery, 

time to celebrate 
yes, right 
here cern, 
there a grandiose meeting 
forthcoming nobel laureates 
this mechanism, peter higgs 
franois englert 
franois 
franois 
englert 
englert 
yes, englert, thats 
so data 
accumulated until today, 
we relatively sure that we really 
deal a higgs boson, arent we 
we know that is really a higgs boson 
something else 
well, we study properties 
higgs boson 
predicted 
standard model since 
yes, right 
we knew 
so, 
everything known except mass, wasnt 
exactly, we knew everything 
it, except mass 
fact that existed 
so, we found that exists that mass measured 
gigaelectronvolts, 
to quote 
yes so, moment 
one knew mass, everything 
predicted, like couplings 
particles 
so, measuring number times 
decays 
two photons, four leptons, 
final states, 
one verifies if this corresponds exactly 
to prediction standard model 
so, today this is case, 
still a large 
experimental uncertainty 
that is to say that we measure 
couplings to roughly accuracy 
ok 
so, there is still margin 
this precision, is 
compatible this hypothesis 
that is a higgs boson 
yes exactly 
we also verified quantum numbers 
higgs boson, spin, charge, 
parity, etc 
charge zero spin zero 
right 
probably spin , 
i believe that spin is 
practically excluded, isnt 
spin is already excluded 
simple fact that we observe 
that higgs decays 
two photons 
yes 
in fact, thats true 
afterwards we excluded spin , 
is really exotic 
that way we excluded that could 
a graviton, instead a higgs boson 
here we 
rather easily 
ok 
so change 
there a lot noise made 
around discovery 
change a 
physicist like you 
this, proof that this 
effect exists, 
this change paradigms 
well yes 
this means that explained to 
university, that mass elementary 
particles, that is an intrinsic 
property, that 
particles massless, 
acquire a sort effective mass, 
moving, 
sort slowed 
higgs field, 
fills vacuum, 
this is something completely counterintuitive, 
you learn university, 
day that you really see 
this mechanism work 
that is revolution, 
least, really happened in brain 
is moment we 
discovered higgs 
that i told but, this is 
thus really mechanism 
really that i thought 
a bit intensively 
that this a revolution 
we shared thought 
to abandon this well rooted notion, that 
mass is an intrinsic property, 
that particles born with, 
replace a coupling constant 
to an ubiquitous field, that is a big step 
that is a big step 
yeah yeah, really is an interior revolution 
so, this to 
mass trolley one pushes 
well, nothing haha, nothing 
that is world 
decouples a bit 
everydays world, yeah, yeah 
yes, i already explained 
in previous module 
mass ordinary matter, 
gravitational mass 
inertial mass given 
essentially mass nucleus, 
nothing to mass 
electrons quarks 
so, will follow 
one continue 
one already completed 
standard model 
one could stop there, 
one continue 
experiments like atlas 
there plenty good reasons to continue 
give us some, please 
so 
we there this higgs mechanism, 
is a complicated mechanism, 
to answer question is mass 
elementary particles 
we answered this question, 
time, we opened lots new questions 
so, existence this field in 
vacuum poses lots questions 
poses a lot problems 
is in fact funny, one shifts problem 
one poses a 
first question, one answers it, in 
answering it, one puts a new question 
one shifted intrinsic mass to 
a coupling constant, 
that one must predict explain 
exactly 
mere existence 
field is problematic 
this field is fluctuating, 
receives kinds 
radiative corrections, thus, 
way is 
that is already a first reason us 
to think that we understood everything, 
that we must continue to 
make collisions 
to understand this mechanism a little better 
so this, way, 
is really a question linked to 
particle physics 
there plenty observations, 
linked to universe, 
like existence dark matter 
dark energy 
correspond to less 
contents universe, 
we know origin, 
explained 
particles we seen to 
date accelerators 
so we know start 
that we must still find things 
that we know yet 
thus, we continue to search 
to stay higgs 
a little more, we even know, 
far i understand, if is 
particle properties, we 
there could several 
absolutely 
in particular, to relieve 
problems higgs boson brings 
to standard model, predicts one, 
one invented, example, 
a solution to problems 
is called supersymmetry 
this is one solutions, there several, 
in this framwork 
is favorite one, 
favourite one, i think, 
lhc started, 
is in bad shape, 
we still seen it, 
ok 
so this is one extension 
standard model, 
one effectively predicts 
higgs bosons 
there even five, 
neutral ones charged ones 
minimum 
so yes, we continue to search 
higgs bosons 
is that reason that one increased 
energy practically a factor , 
one is 
whole year, 
you experimented a total energy 
teraelectronvolts 
is there still margin, 
concerning either luminosity 
energy accelerator 
so, 
lhc energy one is practically 
maximum 
theoretical maximum, energy 
lhc constructed 
tev, 
we tev, i believe 
is quite complicated to arrive 
i believe would make 
a big difference, 
is 
right, 
will make a large difference, 
we thus arrived maximum 
lhc far energy is concerned 
in terms luminosity, clearly, 
there improvements there is 
already we call 
upgrades, foreseen in future, 
to strongly increase luminosity, 
so to accumulate times 
statistics, is will happen 
afterwards, to go to higher energies, 
means really to construct 
a new accelerator 
that is longer term, 
we talk several decades here 
there projects table 
to that 
we will certainly dedicate 
another mooc to this great project, 
a nickname, 
is called fcc moment 
yes 
so, thank you, sandrine, 
this interview 
interesting 
to see someone 
a rather important role in 
this discovery lived 
thank you much
