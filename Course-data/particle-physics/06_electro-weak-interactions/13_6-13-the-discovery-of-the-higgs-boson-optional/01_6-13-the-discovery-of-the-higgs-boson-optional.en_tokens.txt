in
this
module
,
we
are
discussing
the
properties
of
electroweak
interactions
.
and
in
this
video
we
will
visit
the
atlas
experiment
,
whose
visitor
center
is
behind
me
.
atlas
is
an
experiment
installed
at
the
large
hadron
collider
lhc
of
cern
.
in
video
3.2a
we
have
already
introduced
the
full
range
of
cernÃ¢ÂÂs
accelerators
.
and
in
video
3.10a
,
we
have
discussed
the
properties
of
the
atlas
detector
.
today
we
will
talk
with
one
of
the
active
participants
in
the
discovery
of
the
higgs
boson
,
who
is
sandrine
laplace
.
follow
me
please
.

i
will
quickly
present
to
you
our
interview
partner
of
today
,
who
is
sandrine
laplace
.
sandrine
obtained
her
phd
in
2003
at
the
laboratoire
dÃ¢ÂÂaccÃ£Â©lÃ£Â©rateur
linÃ£Â©aire
lal
in
orsay
,
close
to
paris
.
on
a
subject
of
cp
violation
.
then
she
joined
the
laboratoire
dÃ¢ÂÂannecy
de
la
physique
des
particules
,
lapp
,
close
to
here
,
about
50
km
from
geneva
,
to
join
the
atlas
experiment
,
to
which
lapp
contributes
in
a
major
way
.
then
in
2011
,
if
i
remember
correctly
,
she
joined
the
laboratoire
de
physique
nuclÃ£Â©aire
et
des
hautes
Ã£Â©nergies
,
lpnhe
in
paris
,
where
she
still
works
today
,
always
on
the
atlas
experiment
,
which
is
our
subject
today
.
so
,
sandrine
,
do
you
still
remember
when
you
first
heard
about
the
higgs
mechanism
and
the
higgs
boson
?
>
>
yes
,
i
do
remember
.
it
was
at
the
university
,
during
a
course
.
>
>
i
imagine
,
and
i
hope
so
!
>

well
,
a
course
with
was
called
dea
at
the
time
,
in
the
fifth
year
in
france
.
indeed
in
a
field
theory
course
,
that
is
where
i
think
i
first
heard
about
the
higgs
mechanism
and
the
higgs
boson
.
>
>
and
what
did
you
think
at
that
time
about
this
somewhat
complex
mechanism
?
>
>
indeed
,
at
the
time
,
it
seemed
complex
to
me
.
as
a
student
,
one
has
a
sort
of
intuition
of
what
for
example
the
mass
of
a
particle
could
be
.
and
then
one
day
,
someone
explains
that
it
is
more
complicated
than
that
.
>
>
in
fact
,
that
mass
does
not
exist
.
>
>
yes
,
so
i
remember
that
i
found
this
pretty
complicated
for
a
property
that
seemed
simple
to
me
.
and
in
addition
,
it
was
very
theoretical
at
the
time
,
since
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
course
.
it
became
somewhat
more
concrete
,
when
during
my
phd
,
while
i
worked
on
a
totally
different
subject
,
in
the
year
2000Ã¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
indeed
.
>
>
at
lapp
there
was
some
excitement
about
a
possible
signal
.
>
>
yes
,
a
possible
indirect
signal
of
the
higgs
mechanism
.
in
fact
it
was
very
indirectly
,
through
radiative
corrections
,
that
one
found
that
the
existence
of
this
effect
was
not
totally
excluded
,
that
it
was
even
relatively
probable
,
but
not
directly
accessible
to
that
generation
of
experiments
.
>
>
and
that
was
one
reason
why
we
built
the
lhc
.
did
this
also
count
among
your
motivations
to
join
the
atlas
experiment
at
lhc
,
at
the
time
?
>
>
yes
,
absolutely
.
i
did
not
,
at
that
time
consciously
tell
myself
that
i
will
join
atlas
for
this
very
reason
.
but
,
once
i
arrived
in
the
atlas
collaboration
,
it
appeared
perfectly
natural
to
work
on
this
subject
,
indeed
.
>
>
so
what
was
your
role
during
the
construction
of
atlas
?
>
>
so
i
joined
atlas
in
2003.
in
2003
,
the
detector
was
almost
completely
constructed
.
so
,
i
arrived
at
lapp
annecy
,
which
was
involved
in
the
construction
of
a
sub-detector
,
which
is
called
the
electromagnetic
calorimeter
,
and
which
serves
to
measure
the
energy
of
electrons
and
photons
.
so
,
quite
naturally
,
i
joined
this
activity
,
but
at
that
moment
the
detector
construction
was
already
finished
.
we
exposed
modules
to
particle
beams
at
cern
to
test
the
final
modules
,
determine
their
performance
.
so
,
i
participated
in
that
,
it
was
in
2004-2005.
and
then
the
calorimeter
was
lowered
down
into
the
cavern
,
and
the
electronics
was
pugged
in
,
i
think
this
was
in
2005-2006.
and
from
then
on
,
until
the
start
of
the
lhc
,
in
2009
,
we
were
able
to
study
the
electromagnetic
calorimeter
,
to
make
sure
that
it
worked
well
in
the
cavern
,
that
it
was
ready
for
the
first
collisions
.
so
,
i
have
participated
a
lot
in
this
commissioning
of
the
detector
,
as
we
call
it
.
>
>
and
this
detector
has
evidently
played
a
major
role
throughout
the
history
of
this
discovery
.
so
when
did
you
decide
to
get
involved
in
the
data
analysis
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
this
particle
?
>
>
well
,
early
on
,
because
working
on
the
electromagnetic
calorimeter
,
it
was
natural
to
look
at
a
physics
reaction
that
involved
this
detector
.
so
,
i
got
interested
quickly
in
the
search
for
the
higgs
boson
in
the
channel
where
it
decays
into
two
photons
.
and
which
was
actually
one
of
the
two
channels
where
we
first
saw
the
higgs
boson
.
one
of
the
discovery
channels
.
>
>
but
evidently
,
this
discovery
did
not
happen
in
one
day
.
it
was
a
long
sequence
of
events
.
can
you
recall
for
us
how
you
lived
this
race
for
the
discovery
?
>
>
indeed
,
this
happened
progressively
.
we
started
to
take
data
in
2010.
but
very
little
.
it
became
interesting
in
2011
,
when
we
really
arrived
at
an
energy
of
7
tev
in
the
center-of-mass
frame
.
that
is
when
we
started
to
accumulate
data
.
the
way
we
worked
was
that
we
regularly
watched
,
every
few
weeks
,
the
distribution
of
photon
pairs
we
were
able
to
reconstruct
.
>
>
the
invariant
mass
distribution
.
>
>
yes
,
the
invariant
mass
distribution
,
indeed
,
of
photon
pairs
.
and
then
,
we
waited
to
see
if
photons
could
come
from
the
higgs
boson
,
that
their
mass
starts
to
peak
around
the
higgs
boson
mass
.
and
that
started
to
be
the
case
very
gently
.
that
is
to
say
,
it
really
happened
gradually
.
at
the
beginning
,
we
did
not
have
much
data
,
we
saw
fluctuations
everywhere
.
so
,
we
did
not
know
too
much
.
and
then
,
at
a
certain
moment
,
there
was
one
of
these
fluctuations
,
which
started
to
somehow
deepen
.
>
>
and
which
stayed
always
in
the
same
place
.
>
>
indeed
,
week
after
week
,
it
was
always
there
,
larger
and
larger
,
in
a
regular
manner
.
and
then
,
at
a
certain
moment
,
we
learned
that
our
colleagues
from
the
same
experiment
,
who
worked
on
another
higgs
decay
channel
,
the
one
into
leptons
,
saw
a
fluctuation
,
which
started
to
grow
at
the
same
place
like
ours
.
so
,
at
this
moment
,
we
started
toÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
you
started
to
believe
it
.
>
>
Ã¢ÂÂ¦yes
,
to
believe
it
.
exactly
.
and
in
december
2011
,
there
has
been
a
seminar
.
>
>
here
.
>
>
yes
,
here
at
cern
,
where
for
the
first
time
we
announced
that
we
started
to
see
the
premise
of
the
higgs
boson
.
the
evidence
was
too
weak
at
the
time
to
really
announce
a
discovery
.
but
there
was
serious
premise
,
which
was
confirmed
on
july
4
,
2012
when
we
really
announced
the
discovery
,
because
then
it
wasÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
time
to
celebrate
.
>
>
yes
,
right
.
>
>
above
all
here
at
cern
,
where
there
was
a
grandiose
meeting
with
the
forthcoming
nobel
laureates
for
this
mechanism
,
with
peter
higgs
and
franÃ£Â§ois
englert
.
>
>
franÃ£Â§ois
.
franÃ£Â§ois
who
?
>
>
englert
.
>
>
englert
.
yes
,
englert
,
thatÃ¢ÂÂs
it
.
so
with
the
data
accumulated
until
today
,
we
are
relatively
sure
that
we
really
deal
with
a
higgs
boson
,
arenÃ¢ÂÂt
we
?
how
do
we
know
that
it
is
really
a
higgs
boson
and
not
something
else
?
>
>
well
,
we
study
its
properties
.
the
higgs
boson
was
predicted
by
the
standard
model
since
1964
.
>
>
yes
,
right
.
>
>
and
we
knewÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
so
,
everything
was
known
except
its
mass
,
wasnÃ¢ÂÂt
it
?
>
>
exactly
,
we
knew
everything
about
it
,
except
its
mass
.
and
the
fact
that
it
existed
.
so
,
once
we
found
that
it
exists
and
that
its
mass
was
measuredÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
Ã¢ÂÂ¦125
gigaelectronvolts
,
just
to
quote
itÃ¢ÂÂ¦
>
>
125
yes
.
so
,
from
the
moment
when
one
knew
the
mass
,
everything
was
predicted
,
like
all
its
couplings
with
other
particles
.
so
,
by
measuring
the
number
of
times
when
it
decays
into
two
photons
,
into
four
leptons
,
or
into
other
final
states
,
one
verifies
if
this
corresponds
exactly
to
the
prediction
of
the
standard
model
.
so
,
today
this
is
the
case
,
but
still
with
a
large
experimental
uncertainty
.
that
is
to
say
that
we
measure
these
couplings
to
roughly
15
%
accuracy
.
>
>
ok.
>
>
so
,
there
is
still
some
margin
.
>
>
but
at
this
precision
,
it
is
compatible
with
this
hypothesis
that
it
is
a
higgs
boson
.
>
>
yes
exactly
.
we
have
also
verified
the
quantum
numbers
of
the
higgs
boson
,
its
spin
,
its
charge
,
its
parity
,
etc
.
>
>
with
charge
zero
and
spin
zero
.
>
>
right
.
>
>
very
probably
spin
0
,
i
believe
that
spin
1
is
practically
excluded
,
isnÃ¢ÂÂt
it
?
>
>
spin
1
is
already
excluded
by
the
simple
fact
that
we
observe
that
the
higgs
decays
into
two
photons
.
>
>
yes
!
in
fact
,
thatÃ¢ÂÂs
true
.
>
>
and
afterwards
we
have
excluded
spin
2
,
which
is
really
exotic
.
that
way
we
have
excluded
that
it
could
be
a
graviton
,
instead
of
a
higgs
boson
.
here
we
are
.
rather
easily
too
.
>
>
ok.
so
what
does
it
change
.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
noise
made
around
the
discovery
.
what
does
it
change
for
a
physicist
like
you
?
did
this
,
the
proof
that
this
effect
exists
,
did
this
change
your
paradigms
?
>
>
well
yes
.
this
means
that
what
has
been
explained
to
me
at
university
,
that
the
mass
of
elementary
particles
,
that
it
is
not
an
intrinsic
property
,
but
that
particles
are
massless
,
but
they
acquire
a
sort
of
effective
mass
,
because
when
moving
,
they
are
sort
of
slowed
down
by
the
higgs
field
,
which
fills
the
vacuum
,
this
is
something
completely
counterintuitive
,
you
learn
it
at
university
,
but
the
day
that
you
really
see
this
mechanism
at
work
that
is
when
the
revolution
,
for
me
at
least
,
really
happened
in
my
brain
.
it
is
at
the
moment
when
we
discovered
the
higgs
that
i
told
myself
:
but
,
this
is
thus
really
the
mechanism
?
!
and
it
was
really
then
that
i
thought
a
bit
more
intensively
that
this
was
a
revolution
.
>
>
we
all
shared
the
same
thought
.
to
abandon
this
well
rooted
notion
,
that
mass
is
an
intrinsic
property
,
that
particles
are
born
with
,
and
replace
it
by
a
coupling
constant
to
an
ubiquitous
field
,
that
is
a
big
step
.
>
>
that
is
a
big
step
.
yeah
yeah
,
it
really
is
an
interior
revolution
.
>
>
so
,
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
the
mass
of
the
trolley
which
one
pushes
?
>
>
well
,
nothing
!
haha
,
nothing
at
all
!
>
>
that
is
where
our
world
decouples
a
bit
from
everydayÃ¢ÂÂs
world
,
yeah
,
yeah
.
>
>
yes
,
as
i
already
explained
in
the
previous
module
the
mass
of
ordinary
matter
,
the
gravitational
mass
and
the
inertial
mass
are
given
essentially
by
the
mass
of
the
nucleus
,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
mass
of
electrons
and
quarks
.
so
,
what
will
follow
now
?
why
does
one
continue
when
one
has
already
completed
the
standard
model
?
one
could
stop
there
,
no
?
why
does
one
continue
experiments
like
atlas
?
>
>
there
are
plenty
of
good
reasons
to
continue
!
>
>
give
us
some
,
please
.
>
>
so
.
we
have
there
this
higgs
mechanism
,
which
is
a
complicated
mechanism
,
to
answer
the
question
:
what
is
the
mass
of
elementary
particles
?
we
have
answered
this
question
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
we
have
opened
lots
of
new
questions
.
so
,
the
existence
of
this
field
in
the
vacuum
poses
lots
of
questions
.
it
poses
a
lot
of
problems
.
it
is
in
fact
funny
,
because
one
shifts
the
problem
:
one
poses
a
first
question
,
one
answers
it
,
but
in
answering
it
,
one
puts
a
new
question
.
>
>
one
has
shifted
the
intrinsic
mass
to
a
coupling
constant
,
that
one
must
now
predict
or
explain
.
>
>
exactly
.
and
then
the
mere
existence
of
the
field
is
problematic
.
because
this
field
is
fluctuating
,
it
receives
all
kinds
of
radiative
corrections
,
and
thus
,
it
should
not
be
the
way
it
is
.
that
is
already
a
first
reason
for
us
to
think
that
we
have
not
understood
everything
,
and
that
we
must
continue
to
make
collisions
to
understand
this
mechanism
a
little
better
.
so
this
,
by
the
way
,
is
really
a
question
linked
to
particle
physics
.
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
observations
,
which
are
more
linked
to
the
universe
,
like
the
existence
of
dark
matter
and
dark
energy
which
correspond
to
no
less
than
95
%
of
the
contents
of
the
universe
,
and
of
which
we
do
not
know
the
origin
,
and
which
are
not
at
all
explained
by
all
the
particles
we
have
seen
to
date
at
accelerators
.
so
we
know
from
the
start
that
we
must
still
find
things
that
we
do
not
know
yet
.
thus
,
we
continue
to
search
.
>
>
to
stay
with
the
higgs
just
a
little
more
,
we
do
not
even
know
,
as
far
as
i
understand
,
if
it
is
the
only
particle
with
these
properties
,
do
we
?
there
could
be
several
.

absolutely
.
in
particular
,
to
relieve
the
problems
which
the
higgs
boson
brings
to
the
standard
model
,
which
predicts
only
one
,
one
has
invented
,
for
example
,
a
solution
to
these
problems
which
is
called
supersymmetry
.
this
is
one
of
the
solutions
,
there
are
several
,
but
in
this
framwork
>

it
is
not
my
favorite
one
,
but
be
it
.
>

it
was
my
favourite
one
,
i
think
,
before
the
lhc
started
,
but
by
now
it
is
in
bad
shape
,
because
we
have
still
not
seen
it
,
but
ok.
so
this
is
one
extension
of
the
standard
model
,
where
one
effectively
predicts
other
higgs
bosons
.
where
there
are
even
five
,
neutral
ones
and
charged
ones
.
at
minimum
.
so
yes
,
we
continue
to
search
for
other
higgs
bosons
.

it
is
for
that
reason
that
one
has
now
increased
the
energy
by
practically
a
factor
of
2
,
where
one
is
now
.
during
the
whole
year
,
you
have
experimented
at
a
total
energy
of
13
teraelectronvolts
.
is
there
still
more
margin
,
concerning
either
the
luminosity
or
the
energy
of
the
accelerator
?

so
,
with
the
lhc
energy
one
is
practically
at
the
maximum
.
the
theoretical
maximum
,
the
energy
for
which
the
lhc
has
been
constructed
was
14
tev
,
and
we
are
now
at
13
tev
,
i
believe
it
is
quite
complicated
to
arrive
at
14
.

and
i
believe
it
would
not
make
a
big
difference
,
it
is
just
10
%
more
.
>

right
,
it
will
not
make
a
large
difference
,
we
have
thus
arrived
at
the
maximum
of
the
lhc
as
far
as
energy
is
concerned
.
in
terms
of
luminosity
,
clearly
,
there
are
improvements
and
there
is
already
what
we
call
upgrades
,
foreseen
in
the
future
,
to
strongly
increase
the
luminosity
,
so
as
to
accumulate
100
times
more
statistics
,
which
is
what
will
happen
.
and
then
afterwards
,
to
go
to
higher
energies
,
means
really
to
construct
a
new
accelerator
and
that
is
for
the
longer
term
,
we
talk
about
several
decades
here
.
there
are
projects
on
the
table
to
do
that
.

we
will
certainly
dedicate
another
mooc
to
this
great
project
,
which
has
a
nickname
,
it
is
called
fcc
for
the
moment

so
,
thank
you
,
sandrine
,
for
this
interview
.
it
was
very
interesting
to
see
how
someone
who
has
had
a
rather
important
role
in
this
discovery
has
lived
it
.
thank
you
very
much
.
