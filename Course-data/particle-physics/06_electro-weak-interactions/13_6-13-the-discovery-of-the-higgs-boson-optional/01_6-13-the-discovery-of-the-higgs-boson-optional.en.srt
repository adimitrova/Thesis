00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,471
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:12,360
[MUSIC] >> In this module,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,090
we are discussing the properties
of electroweak interactions. 

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,299
And in this video we will 
visit the ATLAS experiment,

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,800
whose visitor center is behind me. 

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,680
ATLAS is an experiment installed 
at the Large Hadron Collider LHC of CERN.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,050
In video 3.2a

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,120
we have already introduced the full 
range of CERN’s accelerators.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,665
And in video 3.10a, we have discussed the
properties of the ATLAS detector. 

10
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:50,175
Today we will talk with 
one of the active participants 

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,680
in the discovery of the Higgs boson, 
who is Sandrine Laplace.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,735
Follow me please.

13
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:01,055
>> I will quickly present to you our
interview partner of today, 

14
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,600
who is Sandrine Laplace.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,860
Sandrine obtained her PhD in 2003

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,310
at the Laboratoire d’Accélérateur Linéaire LAL
in Orsay, close to Paris.  

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,070
on a subject of CP violation. 

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,730
Then she joined the Laboratoire d’Annecy de la
physique des particules, LAPP,  

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,760
close to here, about 50 km from Geneva,

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,480
to join the ATLAS experiment,

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,030
to which LAPP contributes in a major way. 

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,530
Then in 2011, if I remember correctly, 

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,470
she joined the Laboratoire de physique
nucléaire et des hautes énergies,

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,015
LPNHE in Paris, where she still works today,

25
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:51,963
always on the ATLAS experiment, 
which is our subject today. 

26
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:56,585
So, Sandrine, do you still remember 
when you first heard about

27
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:01,545
the Higgs mechanism and
the Higgs boson?

28
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:03,005
>> Yes, I do remember.

29
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,135
It was at the university, during a course.

30
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,085
>> I imagine, and I hope so!

31
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,455
>> Well, a course with was called 
DEA at the time, 

32
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,595
in the fifth year in France. 

33
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:18,365
Indeed in a field theory course,
that is where I think I first 

34
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:22,265
heard about the Higgs mechanism
and the Higgs boson. 

35
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:24,770
>> And what did you 
think at that time

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,360
about this somewhat complex mechanism?

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,245
>> Indeed, at the time, it seemed
complex to me.

38
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:32,670
As a student, one has a
sort of intuition of what 

39
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,820
for example the mass
of a particle could be. 

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,380
And then one day, someone explains that
it is more complicated than that.

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,350
>> In fact, that mass does not exist. 

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,210
>> Yes, so I remember that I found
this pretty complicated

43
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,880
for a property that seemed

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,660
simple to me.

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,660
And in addition, it was very 
theoretical at the time,

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,330
since it was in the context of a course.

47
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,650
It became somewhat more concrete,
when during my PhD, 

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,000
while I worked on a totally different subject,

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,130
in the year 2000…
>> Indeed.

50
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,940
>> at LAPP there was some excitement
about a possible signal. 

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,720
>> Yes, a possible indirect signal 
of the Higgs mechanism. 

52
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,380
In fact it was very indirectly, 
through radiative corrections,

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,860
that one found that the existence
of this effect was not totally excluded,

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,870
that it was even relatively probable, 

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,260
but not directly accessible to
that generation of experiments.

56
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,230
>> And that was one reason 
why we built the LHC. 

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,750
Did this also count among your

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,770
motivations to join the ATLAS 
experiment at LHC, at the time?

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,860
>> Yes, absolutely. 
I did not, at that time

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,420
consciously tell myself that

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,100
I will join ATLAS for this
very reason. 

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,950
But, once I arrived in the
ATLAS collaboration,

63
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,890
it appeared perfectly natural to
work on this subject, indeed. 

64
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,460
>> So what was your role 
during the construction of ATLAS? 

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,860
>> So I joined ATLAS in 2003.

66
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,130
In 2003, the detector was almost
completely constructed.

67
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,620
So, I arrived at LAPP Annecy, 
which was involved in the construction

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,700
of a sub-detector, which is called the 
electromagnetic calorimeter,

69
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,990
and which serves to measure the energy 
of electrons and photons.

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,780
So, quite naturally, I joined
this activity, but at that moment 

71
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,290
the detector construction 
was already finished. 

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,420
We exposed modules
to particle beams at CERN

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,500
to test the final modules,
determine their performance. 

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,780
So, I participated in that,
it was in 2004-2005.

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,670
And then the calorimeter was lowered 
down into the cavern,

76
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,185
and the electronics was pugged in,
I think this was in 2005-2006.

77
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:52,645
And from then on,
until the start of the LHC,

78
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:56,845
in 2009, we were able to study the
electromagnetic calorimeter, to make sure 

79
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,255
that it worked well in the cavern, that it
was ready for the first collisions.

80
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:04,410
So, I have participated a lot in this 
commissioning of the detector, as we call it. 

81
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,960
>> And this detector has evidently 
played a major role

82
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,940
throughout the history of
this discovery. 

83
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,880
So when did you decide to get involved
in the data analysis 

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
which led to the discovery of this particle?

85
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,470
>> Well, early on, because
working on the electromagnetic 

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,410
calorimeter, it was natural to

87
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,450
look at a physics reaction that 
involved this detector. 

88
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,720
So, I got interested quickly in the
search for the Higgs boson in the channel

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,550
where it decays into two photons. 

90
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,470
And which was actually one of the two
channels where we first saw

91
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,570
the Higgs boson. 

92
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,780
One of the discovery channels. 

93
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,380
>> But evidently, this discovery
did not happen in one day. 

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,755
It was a long sequence of events. 

95
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:53,900
Can you recall for us how

96
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,510
you lived this race for the discovery?

97
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,000
>> Indeed, this happened progressively. 

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,630
We started to take data 
in 2010. 

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,630
But very little. 

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,540
It became interesting in 2011, 

101
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,910
when we really arrived at an energy
of 7 TeV in the center-of-mass frame. 

102
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,560
That is when we started to accumulate data.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,380
The way we worked was

104
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,080
that we regularly watched,
every few weeks,

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,380
the distribution of photon pairs
we were able to reconstruct. 

106
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,990
>> The invariant mass distribution. 

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,950
>> Yes, the invariant mass distribution, indeed, 

108
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,960
of photon pairs.

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,450
And then, we waited to see if 
photons could come from the Higgs boson,

110
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,350
that their mass starts to 

111
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,160
peak around the 
Higgs boson mass. 

112
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,845
And that started to be
the case very gently. 

113
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,420
That is to say, it really happened 
gradually.

114
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,710
At the beginning,
we did not have much data,

115
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,170
we saw fluctuations everywhere.

116
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,830
So, we did not know too much. 

117
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,540
And then, at a certain moment, there
was one of these fluctuations, which started

118
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,660
to somehow deepen. 

119
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,720
>> And which stayed always in the same place.

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,610
>> Indeed, week after week, it
was always there, larger and larger,

121
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,310
in a regular manner.

122
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,530
And then, at a certain moment, we learned
that our colleagues from the same experiment,

123
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,235
who worked on another Higgs decay channel,
the one into leptons,

124
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:10,255
saw a fluctuation, which started to 
grow at the same place like ours.  

125
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,105
So, at this moment, we started to…

126
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,405
>> You started to believe it.

127
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,335
>> …yes, to believe it.

128
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,545
Exactly. And in December 2011,

129
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,135
there has been a seminar. 

130
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:18,775
>> Here.

131
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,595
>> Yes, here at CERN, 
where for the first time

132
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:23,800
we announced that we started to see
the premise of the Higgs boson. 

133
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,390
The evidence was too weak at the time
to really announce a discovery. 

134
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,600
But there was serious premise, 
which was confirmed on July 4, 2012

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,090
when we really announced the discovery, 
because then it was…

136
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,170
>> Time to celebrate.

137
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,400
>> Yes, right. 
>> Above all here at CERN,

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,420
where there was a grandiose meeting
with the forthcoming Nobel laureates

139
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,800
for this mechanism, with Peter Higgs and
François Englert.

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,100
>> François.

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,900
François who?

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,480
>> Englert.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,260
>> Englert.

144
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,478
Yes, Englert, that’s it.

145
00:07:53,478 --> 00:08:00,250
So with the data
accumulated until today,

146
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,270
we are relatively sure that we really
deal with a Higgs boson, aren’t we?

147
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,790
How do we know that it is really a Higgs boson 
and not something else?

148
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,180
>> Well, we study its properties.

149
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,130
The Higgs boson 

150
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,980
was predicted by the 
Standard Model since 1964.

151
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,100
>> Yes, right.
>> And we knew…

152
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,310
>> So,

153
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,130
everything was known except its mass, wasn’t it?

154
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,225
>> Exactly, we knew everything 
about it, except its mass. 

155
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,375
And the fact that it existed. 

156
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:27,325
So, once we found that it exists and that its mass was measured…

157
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,575
>> …125 Gigaelectronvolts,

158
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,445
just to quote it…

159
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:33,185
>> 125 yes. So, from the moment when
one knew the mass, everything

160
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:37,195
was predicted, like all its couplings
with other particles.

161
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:41,740
So, by measuring the number of times
when it decays into 

162
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,840
two photons, into four leptons,
or into other final states,

163
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,820
one verifies if this corresponds exactly
to the prediction of the Standard Model. 

164
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,740
So, today this is the case,

165
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,095
but still with a large
experimental uncertainty. 

166
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,761
That is to say that we measure these 
couplings to roughly 15% accuracy.

167
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:58,710
>> OK.

168
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,690
>> So, there is still some margin. 

169
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,100
>> But at this precision, it is
compatible with this hypothesis

170
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,180
that it is a Higgs boson. 
>> Yes exactly. 

171
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,090
We have also verified the quantum numbers
of the Higgs boson, its spin, its charge,

172
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,920
its parity, etc.

173
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,550
>> With charge zero and spin zero.

174
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,780
>> Right.
>> Very probably spin 0,

175
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,470
I believe that spin 1 is 
practically excluded, isn’t it?

176
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,630
>> Spin 1 is already excluded 
by the simple fact that we observe

177
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,260
that the Higgs decays into
two photons. 

178
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,270
>> Yes!
In fact, that’s true.

179
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,020
>> And afterwards we have excluded spin 2,
which is really exotic.

180
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,830
That way we have excluded that it could be
a graviton, instead of a Higgs boson. 

181
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,330
Here we are.

182
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,610
Rather easily too.

183
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,620
>> OK.
So what does it change. 

184
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,315
There has been a lot of noise made 
around the discovery. 

185
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:38,418
What does it change for a
physicist like you?

186
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:42,895
Did this, the proof that this 
effect exists,

187
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:46,220
did this change your paradigms?

188
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,115
>> Well yes.

189
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:52,190
This means that what has been explained to me 
at university, that the mass of elementary 

190
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,720
particles, that it is not an intrinsic
property, but that 

191
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,440
particles are massless, but they
acquire a sort of effective mass,

192
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,980
because when moving, they are
sort of slowed down

193
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,510
by the Higgs field,
which fills the vacuum,

194
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,260
this is something completely counterintuitive,
you learn it at university, 

195
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,420
but the day that you really see
this mechanism at work

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,090
that is when the revolution, for me
at least, really happened in my brain. 

197
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,910
It is at the moment when we
discovered the Higgs

198
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,871
that I told myself: but, this is
thus really the mechanism?!

199
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:26,660
And it was really then that I thought
a bit more intensively

200
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,860
that this was a revolution.

201
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,430
>> We all shared the same thought.

202
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,630
To abandon this well rooted notion, that

203
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,920
mass is an intrinsic property,
that particles are born with,

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,600
and replace it by a coupling constant
to an ubiquitous field, that is a big step. 

205
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,290
>> That is a big step. 

206
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah yeah, it really is an interior revolution. 

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,150
>> So, what does this have to do with the  

208
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,530
mass of the trolley which one pushes?

209
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,970
>> Well, nothing! Haha, nothing at all!

210
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,220
>> That is where our world 
decouples a bit

211
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,630
from everyday’s world, yeah, yeah. 

212
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,070
>> Yes, as I already explained 
in the previous module

213
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,580
the mass of ordinary matter,
the gravitational mass

214
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,980
and the inertial mass are given
essentially by the mass of the nucleus,

215
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,720
which has nothing to do with the mass
of electrons and quarks. 

216
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,740
So, what will follow now?

217
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,915
Why does one continue

218
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,615
when one has already completed 
the Standard Model?

219
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:26,895
One could stop there, no?

220
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,615
Why does one continue 
experiments like ATLAS?

221
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:32,985
>> There are plenty of good reasons to continue!

222
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,425
>> Give us some, please. 

223
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:34,995
>> So.

224
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,445
We have there this Higgs mechanism,
which is a complicated mechanism,

225
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:42,945
to answer the question: what is the mass
of elementary particles?

226
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:46,735
We have answered this question, but at 
the same time, we have opened lots of new questions.

227
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:50,975
So, the existence of this field in the
vacuum poses lots of questions.

228
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,425
It poses a lot of problems.

229
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,825
It is in fact funny, because one shifts the problem:
one poses a

230
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:59,255
first question, one answers it, but in
answering it, one puts a new question.

231
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:02,775
>> One has shifted the intrinsic mass to 
a coupling constant,

232
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,390
that one must now predict or explain.
>> Exactly. 

233
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,440
And then the mere existence of the
field is problematic. 

234
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,060
Because this field is fluctuating,
it receives all kinds of

235
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,590
radiative corrections, and thus,
it should not be the way it is.

236
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,380
That is already a first reason for us
to think that we have not understood everything,

237
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,060
and that we must continue to 
make collisions

238
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,280
to understand this mechanism a little better. 

239
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,050
So this, by the way, 

240
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,200
is really a question linked to 
particle physics. 

241
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,690
But there are plenty of other observations,
which are more linked to the Universe,

242
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,060
like the existence of dark matter 
and dark energy

243
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,130
which correspond to no less than 95%
of the contents of the Universe,

244
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,840
and of which we do not know the origin,
and which are not at all explained 

245
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,340
by all the particles we have seen to
date at accelerators. 

246
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,450
So we know from the start

247
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,015
that we must still find things
that we do not know yet.

248
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:49,995
Thus, we continue to search.

249
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,585
>> To stay with the Higgs 
just a little more, we do not even know,

250
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:58,955
as far as I understand, if it is the only
particle with these properties, do we?

251
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:02,255
There could be several.
>> Absolutely. 

252
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:08,230
In particular, to relieve the 
problems which the Higgs boson brings 

253
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,560
to the Standard Model, which predicts only one,

254
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,290
one has invented, for example,
a solution to these problems

255
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,570
which is called Supersymmetry.

256
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,810
This is one of the solutions, there are several, 
but in this framwork

257
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,090
>> It is not my favorite one, but be it.

258
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,080
>> It was my favourite one, I think,

259
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,450
before the LHC started, 
but by now it is in bad shape,

260
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,655
because we have still not seen it,
but OK. 

261
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:32,935
So this is one extension 
of the Standard Model, where 

262
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:34,845
one effectively predicts 
other Higgs bosons.

263
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,825
Where there are even five, 

264
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,605
neutral ones and charged ones. 

265
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,615
At minimum. 

266
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,245
So yes, we continue to search for
other Higgs bosons. 

267
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,815
>> It is for that reason that one has now increased 
the energy by practically a factor of 2,

268
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:48,640
where one is now. 
During the whole year,

269
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,245
you have experimented at a total energy 
of 13 teraelectronvolts.

270
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,600
Is there still more margin,  

271
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,690
concerning either the luminosity 
or the energy of the accelerator?

272
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,540
>> So, 

273
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,590
with the LHC energy one is practically 
at the maximum. 

274
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,170
The theoretical maximum, the energy 
for which the LHC has been constructed 

275
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,740
was 14 TeV, 
and we are now at 13 TeV, I believe

276
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,350
it is quite complicated to arrive at 14.
>> And I believe it would not make 

277
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,050
a big difference,

278
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,115
it is just 10% more. 
>> Right,

279
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,316
it will not make a large difference,
we have thus arrived at the maximum

280
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,210
of the LHC as far as energy is concerned.
In terms of luminosity, clearly, 

281
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,460
there are improvements and there is
already what we call 

282
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,460
upgrades, foreseen in the future,
to strongly increase the luminosity,

283
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,490
so as to accumulate 100 times more
statistics, which is what will happen.

284
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,420
And then afterwards, to go to higher energies,

285
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,040
means really to construct 
a new accelerator

286
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,250
and that is for the longer term,
we talk about several decades here.

287
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,180
There are projects on the table
to do that. 

288
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,720
>> We will  certainly dedicate 
another MOOC to this great project, 

289
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,690
which has a nickname, 
it is called FCC for the moment. 

290
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,130
>> Yes. 
>> So, thank you, Sandrine,

291
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,620
for this interview. 

292
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,520
It was very interesting
to see how someone who has had

293
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,875
a rather important role in
this discovery has lived it.  

294
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,565
Thank you very much.
