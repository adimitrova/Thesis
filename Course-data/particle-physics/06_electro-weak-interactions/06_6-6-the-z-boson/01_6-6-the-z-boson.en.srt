2
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:13,461
In this sixth module,
we are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,286
In this sixth video, we'll talk
about the properties of the Z boson,

4
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:19,748
which transmits the neutral weak force and

5
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:22,838
can be considered as the heavy
brother of the photon.

6
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:26,474
After following this video you will
know its properties, its mass, and

7
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,990
the way to measure it and
its couplings to matter.

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:36,339
In video 4.5, we have already discussed
the prototype process e+e- -> µ+µ-

9
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:41,537
for the production of fermion
pairs by electron-positron annihilation.

10
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:45,505
In addition to electromagnetic
interactions, as shown in the left graph,

11
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,667
this process can be mediated
by neutral weak interactions,

12
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,140
as shown in the right graph.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,920
Since initial and final states
are the same, one must add the amplitudes.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,090
In the cross-section,
we thus find three terms to lowest order.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,870
The first term, sigma_gamma, contains the
square of the photon exchange amplitude.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,837
The second one, sigma_Z,
that of the Z exchange.

17
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:11,821
And the third one, sigma_int,
the interference between the two.

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:18,270
For the photon alone, we already
quoted the cross-section in video 4.5.

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,310
The total differential cross-section,

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,933
which also takes into account the other
two contributions, contains a term

21
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:27,800
symmetric in the scattering angle theta
like the one we had found for the photon.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,363
The scattering angle,

23
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:34,295
I remind you, is the angle between
the incoming e- and the outgoing mu-.

24
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:38,887
The coefficient A_0 of this
term now contains a new

25
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:42,723
contribution due to weak interactions.

26
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:48,652
There is also an additional asymmetric
term proportional to the coefficient A_1.

27
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:53,757
The coefficients contain the real part and
the square of a resonance term,

28
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:58,538
r, which comes from the resonant
production of Z bosons when the total

29
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:01,147
e+e- energy approaches the Z mass.

30
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:04,819
It contains the Breit-Wigner
function characteristic for

31
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,483
the propagator of massive virtual bosons.

32
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:11,793
The coupling constants, g_V and g_A,
depend on the electric charge and

33
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:15,749
the weak isospin of the matter particles
involved in each vertex.

34
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:20,375
Due to the value of the weak mixing angle,
sin^2 theta roughly equal to 1/4,

35
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:25,289
g_V has a small value for charged
leptons, g_A is simply -1/2.

36
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:32,432
At low energies,
square root of s much less than M_Z,

37
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:35,260
where r is roughly equal to 0,

38
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,900
the influence of weak
interactions is negligible.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,390
We fall back onto the result
found by electromagnetism,

40
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,303
that is to say, A_0 = 1 and A_1 = 0.

41
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:52,676
The terms proportional to the real part
of r are due to electro-weak interference

42
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:57,435
and are important in the intermediate
region where neither the photon nor

43
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,369
the Z exchange are dominant.

44
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:03,491
And finally, close to the Z mass,
where the terms proportional to r^2

45
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,409
dominate, we find that the weak
interaction is two orders of magnitude

46
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,649
stronger than the electromagnetic one,
due to the amplification by the resonance.

47
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:19,585
The Z resonance manifests itself by a
enormous peak in the total cross-section.

48
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:22,181
Electro-weak interference causes a large,

49
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,051
angular asymmetry on
the flanks of the resonance.

50
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,530
At low energies, the cross-section depends
on the electromagnetic coupling alpha and

51
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,339
the square of the center of mass energy s,

52
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:39,028
like sigma = 4pi alpha^2/(3s),

53
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:44,344
the characteristic size and shape of
purely electromagnetic interactions.

54
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:49,431
As the energy approaches the Z peak,
we see an enormous increase and

55
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:54,431
weak interactions dominates the process,
thanks to the resonant

56
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:59,894
exchange of Z bosons that we now may
call almost real instead of virtual.

57
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:06,433
Far above the resonance, the two processes
add up and are of comparable size.

58
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:12,455
The interference term introduces
an asymmetry into the angular

59
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:16,048
distribution, which we had
already noted in Video 4.5.

60
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,860
To quantify it,
one defines a forward-backward asymmetry,

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,124
A_FB, comparing the rate of forward 
– theta less than 90 degrees –

62
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:30,505
and backward scattering
– theta bigger than 90 degrees.

63
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:35,812
This asymmetry is large and negative
below the resonance, goes through zero at

64
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:41,731
s roughly equal to M_Z squared and becomes
large and positive above the resonance.

65
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,902
In the immediate vicinity of
the Z resonance, that is to say,

66
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:54,387
a few Z widths away from the Z mass,
we can neglect both electromagnetic

67
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:57,741
interactions and
electromagnetic interference.

68
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:02,599
For all e+e- interactions into
a pair of point-like fermions,

69
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:07,214
we then obtain a cross-section
with a peak given by r squared.

70
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,796
In this region, the Z boson is quasi-real.

71
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,289
The maximum of the cross-section can be

72
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,791
expressed in terms of the decay
width gamma_Z of the real Z boson.

73
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,498
The partial widths of the Z decay into
electrons and other fermions depend

74
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:28,370
on their weak and electromagnetic
charges T_3 and Q, as shown on the left.

75
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,102
In addition, the number of colors N_C
comes in for our quark final states.

76
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:37,672
The partial and total width can
be derived from the shape and

77
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,184
height of the measured cross-section,

78
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:45,163
for antifermion species with a mass
smaller than half the Z boson mass.

79
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:50,821
This even includes neutrinos, which
are not seen in the measured final state,

80
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,530
as are any other invisible particles.

81
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,349
In this way, experiments have fixed
the number of neutrino species with

82
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,168
mass of the neutrino less than mass of
the Z divided by two to exactly three

83
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:07,524
with very high position,
as you can see in the graph on the right.

84
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:11,577
There are thus only three
generations of light matter.

85
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:18,170
The position of the peak determines that
mass of the Z boson with high precision.

86
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,350
Here we show the results
of the four experiments at

87
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,588
the CERN Large Electron-Positron collider,
LEP, the predecessor of the LHC.

88
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:31,495
The mass determination by the resonance
method is precise to 

89
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,181
two parts in 10^5.

90
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:37,003
This accuracy would correspond
to a measurement of

91
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:40,148
my own weight to about two grams.

92
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:44,738
This may not sound very impressive, but
my lifetime is hopefully of the order of

93
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,878
2 billion seconds, and
I weigh about 10^5 grams.

94
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:53,217
The Z boson lifetime is 
3 10^-25 seconds,

95
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:58,574
and it weighs 1.6251 10-22 grams.

96
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:03,972
At such a level of precision, unexpected
effects influence the measurement.

97
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:11,917
As incredible as it may seem, the phase
of the moon influences this measurement.

98
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:16,347
Just like sea water, the Earth's crust
goes through high and low tides,

99
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:19,576
with a height difference
of about 20 centimeters.

100
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:24,522
The tidal waves deform the LEP storage
ring by some millimeters compared to

101
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,044
its total length of 27 kilometers.

102
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:31,229
At constant frequency,
this changes the beam momentum, and

103
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,892
focalization amplifies this effect.

104
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:38,365
Consequently, the beam energy depends
on the moon phase at the level

105
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,574
of 100 ppm, parts per million.

106
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:44,987
This effect has been measured using
resonant depolarization, a method

107
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:49,845
to determine the energy of the circulating
beam with an impressive precision.

108
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,665
You see the result in this graph,

109
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:55,958
which shows the beam energy over large
portions of the passage of a tidal wave.

110
00:07:57,502 --> 00:08:02,204
And even the passage of the high speed
TGV train in nearby France influences

111
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,407
the measurement.

112
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:07,480
Since the TGV is powered by
a single-phase DC current,

113
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,173
its passage induces parasitic
currents into the storage ring.

114
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:16,813
Because of their hysteresis, the magnets
remember the train schedule,

115
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,653
as you can see on the right.

116
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,670
This, again, leads to a slight
variation of the collider energy.

117
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,770
All of these incredible
effects had to be taken into

118
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,420
account to arrive at the final result for
the Z boson mass.

119
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,098
This should allow you to appreciate
the impressive precision with which

120
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,174
the mass can be measured by
resonant production of a particle.

121
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:42,310
The method remains a specialty
of electron-positron colliders,

122
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,443
since the point-like initial state allows
an excellent definition of the kinematics.

123
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,366
The coupling of the Z boson and
two leptons, g_V and g_A,

124
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,554
are measured using the total and
differential cross-sections as well as

125
00:08:56,554 --> 00:09:00,289
the polarization dependence of
e+e- annihilation into leptons.

126
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,575
One finds confirmation of our
choice of a weak isospin as up and

127
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,921
down members of a doublet.

128
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:11,900
One also finds that all generations
have the same couplings to

129
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,049
an accuracy of a few times 10^-3.

130
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:19,665
For charged leptons, the measured
values of g_V are close to zero, and

131
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,414
g_A close to -1/2, as we expect.

132
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:26,971
For neutrinos, one finds g_V = g_A = 1/2,

133
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:33,202
as one would expect for fermions with
weak isospin up and electric charge zero.

134
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:37,837
In the next video, we will talk about
purely weak interactions, that is to say,

135
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,211
weak decays of quarks.

136
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:45,469
