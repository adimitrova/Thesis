in this sixth module, 
we discussing weak interactions 
in this sixth video, well talk 
properties z boson, 
transmits neutral weak force 
considered heavy 
brother photon 
following this video you will 
know properties, mass, 
way to measure 
couplings to matter 
in video , we already discussed 
prototype process ee 
production fermion 
pairs electronpositron annihilation 
in addition to electromagnetic 
interactions, shown in left graph, 
this process mediated 
neutral weak interactions, 
shown in right graph 
since initial final states 
same, one must add amplitudes 
in crosssection, 
we thus find three terms to lowest order 
first term, sigmagamma, contains 
square photon exchange amplitude 
second one, sigmaz, 
that z exchange 
third one, sigmaint, 
interference between two 
photon alone, we already 
quoted crosssection in video 
total differential crosssection, 
also takes account 
two contributions, contains a term 
symmetric in scattering angle theta 
like one we found photon 
scattering angle, 
i remind you, is angle between 
incoming e outgoing mu 
coefficient a this 
term contains a new 
contribution due to weak interactions 
there is also an additional asymmetric 
term proportional to coefficient a 
coefficients contain real part 
square a resonance term, 
r, comes resonant 
production z bosons total 
ee energy approaches z mass 
contains breitwigner 
function characteristic 
propagator massive virtual bosons 
coupling constants, gv ga, 
depend electric charge 
weak isospin matter particles 
involved in vertex 
due to value weak mixing angle, 
sin theta roughly equal to , 
gv a small value charged 
leptons, ga is simply 
low energies, 
square root much less mz, 
r is roughly equal to , 
influence weak 
interactions is negligible 
we fall back onto result 
found electromagnetism, 
that is to say, a a 
terms proportional to real part 
r due to electroweak interference 
important in intermediate 
region neither photon 
z exchange dominant 
finally, close to z mass, 
terms proportional to r 
dominate, we find that weak 
interaction is two orders magnitude 
stronger electromagnetic one, 
due to amplification resonance 
z resonance manifests a 
enormous peak in total crosssection 
electroweak interference causes a large, 
angular asymmetry 
flanks resonance 
low energies, crosssection depends 
electromagnetic coupling alpha 
square center mass energy s, 
like sigma pi alphas, 
characteristic size shape 
purely electromagnetic interactions 
energy approaches z peak, 
we see an enormous increase 
weak interactions dominates process, 
thanks to resonant 
exchange z bosons that we may 
call almost real instead virtual 
far resonance, two processes 
add comparable size 
interference term introduces 
an asymmetry angular 
distribution, we 
already noted in video 
to quantify it, 
one defines a forwardbackward asymmetry, 
afb, comparing rate forward 
theta less degrees 
backward scattering 
theta bigger degrees 
this asymmetry is large negative 
resonance, goes zero 
roughly equal to mz squared becomes 
large positive resonance 
in immediate vicinity 
z resonance, that is to say, 
a few z widths away z mass, 
we neglect electromagnetic 
interactions 
electromagnetic interference 
ee interactions 
a pair pointlike fermions, 
we obtain a crosssection 
a peak given r squared 
in this region, z boson is quasireal 
maximum crosssection 
expressed in terms decay 
width gammaz real z boson 
partial widths z decay 
electrons fermions depend 
weak electromagnetic 
charges q, shown left 
in addition, number colors nc 
comes in quark final states 
partial total width 
derived shape 
height measured crosssection, 
antifermion species a mass 
smaller half z boson mass 
this even includes neutrinos, 
seen in measured final state, 
invisible particles 
in this way, experiments fixed 
number neutrino species 
mass neutrino less mass 
z divided two to exactly three 
high position, 
you see in graph right 
there thus three 
generations light matter 
position peak determines that 
mass z boson high precision 
here we show results 
four experiments 
cern large electronpositron collider, 
lep, predecessor lhc 
mass determination resonance 
method is precise to 
two parts in 
this accuracy would correspond 
to a measurement 
weight to two grams 
this may sound impressive, 
lifetime is hopefully order 
billion seconds, 
i weigh grams 
z boson lifetime is 
seconds, 
weighs grams 
a level precision, unexpected 
effects influence measurement 
incredible may seem, phase 
moon influences this measurement 
like sea water, earths crust 
goes high low tides, 
a height difference 
centimeters 
tidal waves deform lep storage 
ring millimeters compared to 
total length kilometers 
constant frequency, 
this changes beam momentum, 
focalization amplifies this effect 
consequently, beam energy depends 
moon phase level 
ppm, parts per million 
this effect measured using 
resonant depolarization, a method 
to determine energy circulating 
beam an impressive precision 
you see result in this graph, 
shows beam energy large 
portions passage a tidal wave 
even passage high speed 
tgv train in nearby france influences 
measurement 
since tgv is powered 
a singlephase dc current, 
passage induces parasitic 
currents storage ring 
hysteresis, magnets 
remember train schedule, 
you see right 
this, again, leads to a slight 
variation collider energy 
incredible 
effects to taken 
account to arrive final result 
z boson mass 
this allow you to appreciate 
impressive precision 
mass measured 
resonant production a particle 
method remains a specialty 
electronpositron colliders, 
since pointlike initial state allows 
an excellent definition kinematics 
coupling z boson 
two leptons, gv ga, 
measured using total 
differential crosssections well 
polarization dependence 
ee annihilation leptons 
one finds confirmation 
choice a weak isospin 
members a doublet 
one also finds that generations 
couplings to 
an accuracy a few times 
charged leptons, measured 
values gv close to zero, 
ga close to , we expect 
neutrinos, one finds gv ga , 
one would expect fermions 
weak isospin electric charge zero 
in next video, we will talk 
purely weak interactions, that is to say, 
weak decays quarks
