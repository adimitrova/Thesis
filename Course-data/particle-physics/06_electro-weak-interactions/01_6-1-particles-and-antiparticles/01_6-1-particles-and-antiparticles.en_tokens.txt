hello
and
welcome
to
the
sixth
module
of
our
introductory
course
of
subatomic
physics
.
in
this
sixth
module
,
we
discuss
weak
interactions
and
the
higgs
mechanism
.
you
will
notice
that
this
module
is
again
larger
than
the
average
module
.
this
is
due
to
the
rich
phenomenology
of
electro-weak
interactions
.
we
recommend
that
you
take
two
weeks
to
digest
it
.
before
diving
into
our
subject
,
in
this
first
video
we
will
go
into
more
depth
on
the
subject
of
antiparticles
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
difference
between
particles
and
antiparticles
and
the
connection
between
antiparticles
and
energy-momentum
reversal
.
how
do
antiparticles
come
into
play
in
the
standard
model
?
it
all
starts
with
the
evolution
equation
for
fields
which
takes
the
role
of
an
equation
of
motion
for
particles
.
it
follows
from
relativistic
energy-momentum
conservation
by
operator
substitution
.
the
result
is
the
klein-gordon
equation
for
free
particles
.
its
solutions
follow
a
continuity
equation
as
seen
here
.
it
describes
the
conversation
of
a
four-vector
current
j^Ã¢Âµ
of
particles
.
the
time
component
is
the
probability
density
of
finding
a
particle
at
location
x
and
t.
its
spatial
component
is
the
particle
flow
density
at
that
same
position
.
imagine
an
infinitely
small
volume
that
surrounds
the
point
that
we
are
considering
.
the
density
in
the
volume
can
only
change
Ã¢ÂÂ
drho/dt
not
equal
to
zero
Ã¢ÂÂ
if
particles
enter
or
exit
through
the
boundaries
of
the
volume
,
which
means
that
divergence
of
j
should
then
simultaneously
be
non-equal
to
zero
.
this
ensures
that
the
number
of
particles
in
the
volume
is
conserved
.
it
might
surprise
you
that
the
probability
density
contains
the
time
derivative
of
the
wave
function
.
we
will
understand
this
fact
in
a
little
while
.
the
klein-gordon
equation
is
manifestly
covariant
,
it
contains
only
scalars
under
lorenz
transformation
.
plain
waves
must
be
a
solution
of
the
klein-gordon
equation
,
and
describe
a
free
particle
.
we
use
a
normalization
proportional
to
an
arbitrary
constant
square
root
of
n.
you
may
take
n
as
the
number
density
of
particles
if
you
wish
.
the
current
density
is
proportional
to
the
four-momentum
.
its
temporal
component
is
proportional
to
the
energy
.
this
is
due
to
the
covariance
of
the
quantity
.
it
requires
that
the
probability
rho
d^3x
is
invariant
.
the
volume
element
changes
like
d^3x
-
>
d^3x/gamma
,
because
of
the
lorentz
contraction
in
the
direction
of
motion
.
for
invariance
,
the
probability
density
must
then
change
as
rho
-
>
gamma
times
rho
.
with
gamma
equal
e/m
,
rho
must
thus
be
proportional
to
energy
.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
probability
density
and
current
density
contain
respectively
a
time
and
a
space
derivative
of
the
field
.
let
us
now
consider
the
energy
eigenvalues
of
relativistic
free
particles
,
inserting
a
plane
wave
solution
into
the
klein-gordon
equation
.
we
find
solutions
with
positive
and
with
negative
energy
.
and
since
the
density
of
probability
is
proportional
to
the
energy
,
it
is
no
more
positive
definite
either
.
this
contradicts
the
definition
of
probability
as
a
real
number
between
zero
and
one
.
to
solve
this
problem
we
must
interpret
the
continuity
equation
in
an
innovative
way
,
introducing
the
electromagnetic
current
density
.
proportional
to
the
electric
charge
q
,
j^0
now
becomes
the
local
charge
density
and
thus
,
may
be
negative
as
well
as
positive
in
agreement
with
intuition
.
it
is
obvious
that
solutions
of
positive
and
negative
energy
are
distinguished
by
the
charge
of
the
considered
particle
,
if
one
wants
to
keep
the
probability
density
always
positive
.
it
is
thus
not
the
probability
density
,
2n
p^Ã¢Âµ
,
which
is
invariant
,
but
the
electromagnetic
current
density
,
2q
n
p^Ã¢Âµ
,
which
obeys
the
rules
for
physically
sensible
probabilities
.
the
current
density
is
conserved
by
the
continuity
equation
.
with
this
concept
,
we
can
very
well
spontaneously
create
and
annihilate
particles
,
provided
that
the
total
charge
in
an
infinitesimal
volume
remains
constant
.
all
of
this
is
a
consequence
of
relativistic
covariance
only
.
which
are
the
implications
of
this
reinterpretation
for
the
negative
energy
solutions
?
the
answer
is
given
by
feynman
's
interpretation
of
these
states
.
the
electromagnetic
current
density
of
a
free
electron
with
charge
q
=
-e
,
ignoring
its
spin
,
is
given
by
the
first
equation
.
this
current
is
that
of
a
particle
with
positive
energy
advancing
in
the
direction
of
its
momentum
vector
.
let
us
say
that
it
emerges
from
a
vertex
.
for
a
free
positron
,
q
=
+e
,
the
current
is
positive
but
the
current
density
is
the
same
as
for
an
electron
of
negative
energy
which
moves
in
the
opposite
direction
,
say
entering
into
the
vertex
.
that
is
to
say
that
the
particle
with
negative
energy
which
comes
out
of
a
vertex
is
equivalent
to
an
antiparticle
with
positive
energy
that
enters
intervals
.
in
this
way
,
we
can
eliminate
the
solutions
with
negative
energy
,
and
replace
them
by
antiparticles
evolving
in
the
opposite
direction
.
this
establishes
a
connection
between
the
transformation
between
particles
and
antiparticles
,
which
we
call
charge
conjugation
,
and
the
reversal
of
the
direction
of
momentum
called
parity
.
these
two
transformations
will
be
analyzed
in
more
detail
in
the
next
video
.
but
first
,
we
look
at
the
consequences
of
feynman
's
interpretation
of
negative
energy
states
.
these
consequences
are
indeed
quite
dramatic
as
shown
by
the
example
of
a
simple
double
scattering
process
.
heisenberg
's
principle
allows
us
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
two
scatters
in
time
.
the
intermediate
state
will
then
move
backwards
in
time
.
we
replace
it
by
its
anti-particle
moving
forward
in
time
.
the
double
scatter
then
becomes
a
pair
creation
process
as
shown
on
the
right
followed
by
a
particle/anti-particle
annihilation
process
.
both
contributions
begin
with
the
same
initial
state
and
end
up
with
the
same
final
state
.
we
must
thus
sum
them
at
the
level
of
amplitudes
when
calculating
the
total
probability
of
the
process
.
when
calculating
simple
scatters
,
it
is
sufficient
to
consider
particles
,
the
corresponding
anti-particle
process
can
be
obtained
by
reversing
the
direction
of
the
particles
.
in
the
next
vide
,
we
introduce
the
discreet
transformations
of
space
time
,
parity
,
and
time
reversal
and
charge
conjugation
,
which
transforms
the
wave
function
of
a
particle
into
that
of
an
anti
particle
and
vise
versa
.
