hello 
welcome to sixth module 
introductory course subatomic physics 
in this sixth module, we discuss weak 
interactions higgs mechanism 
you will notice that this module is 
larger average module 
this is due to rich phenomenology 
electroweak interactions 
we recommend that you take 
two weeks to digest 
diving subject, in this 
first video we will go depth 
subject antiparticles 
following this video, you will know 
difference between particles 
antiparticles 
connection between antiparticles 
energymomentum reversal 
antiparticles come 
play in standard model 
starts 
evolution equation 
fields takes role 
an equation motion particles 
follows relativistic 
energymomentum conservation 
operator substitution 
result is kleingordon 
equation free particles 
solutions follow a continuity 
equation seen here 
describes conversation a 
fourvector current j particles 
time component is probability 
density finding a particle 
location x 
spatial component is particle 
flow density that position 
imagine an infinitely small 
volume that surrounds 
point that we considering 
density in volume 
change drhodt equal to zero 
if particles enter exit 
boundaries volume, means that 
divergence j 
simultaneously nonequal to zero 
this ensures that number 
particles in volume 
is conserved 
might surprise you that 
probability density contains 
time derivative wave function 
we will understand this 
fact in a little while 
kleingordon equation is manifestly 
covariant, contains scalars 
lorenz transformation 
plain waves must a solution 
kleingordon equation, 
describe a free particle 
we use a normalization proportional to 
an arbitrary constant square root n 
you may take n number 
density particles if you wish 
current density is 
proportional to fourmomentum 
temporal component is 
proportional to energy 
this is due to covariance 
quantity 
requires that probability 
rho dx is invariant 
volume element changes like 
dx dxgamma, 
lorentz contraction 
in direction motion 
invariance, 
probability density must 
change rho gamma times rho 
gamma equal em, 
rho must thus proportional to energy 
is this reason that 
probability density 
current density contain respectively a 
time a space derivative field 
let us consider energy eigenvalues 
relativistic free particles, 
inserting a plane wave solution 
kleingordon equation 
we find solutions positive 
negative energy 
since density probability 
is proportional to energy, 
is positive definite either 
this contradicts definition 
probability a real number between 
zero one 
to solve this problem we must interpret 
continuity equation in an innovative way, 
introducing electromagnetic 
current density 
proportional to electric charge q, 
j becomes local 
charge density thus, 
may negative well positive 
in agreement intuition 
is obvious that 
solutions positive 
negative energy distinguished 
charge considered particle, 
if one wants to keep probability 
density always positive 
is thus probability density, 
n p, is invariant, 
electromagnetic current density, 
q n p, 
obeys rules 
physically sensible probabilities 
current density is conserved 
continuity equation 
this concept, we well 
spontaneously create annihilate particles, 
provided that total charge in an 
infinitesimal volume remains constant 
this is a consequence 
relativistic covariance 
implications 
this reinterpretation 
negative energy solutions 
answer is given feynmans 
interpretation states 
electromagnetic current density 
a free electron charge q e, 
ignoring spin, is given 
first equation 
this current is that a particle 
positive energy advancing in direction 
momentum vector let us 
say that emerges a vertex 
a free positron, q e, 
current is positive 
current density is an 
electron negative energy moves in 
opposite direction, 
say entering vertex 
that is to say that particle 
negative energy 
comes a vertex is equivalent to 
an antiparticle positive energy that 
enters intervals 
in this way, we eliminate 
solutions negative energy, 
replace antiparticles 
evolving in opposite direction 
this establishes a connection between 
transformation between particles 
antiparticles, we call 
charge conjugation, 
reversal direction 
momentum called parity 
two transformations will analyzed 
in detail in next video 
first, we look consequences 
feynmans interpretation negative 
energy states 
consequences indeed quite 
dramatic shown example 
a simple double scattering process 
heisenbergs principle allows us 
to reverse order two 
scatters in time 
intermediate state will 
move backwards in time 
we replace antiparticle 
moving forward in time 
double scatter becomes a pair 
creation process shown right 
followed a particleantiparticle 
annihilation process 
contributions begin 
initial state 
end final state 
we must thus sum 
level amplitudes 
calculating total 
probability process 
calculating simple scatters, 
is sufficient to consider particles, 
corresponding antiparticle 
process obtained reversing 
direction particles 
in next vide, we introduce 
discreet transformations space time, 
parity, time reversal charge 
conjugation, transforms wave 
function a particle that 
an anti particle vise versa
