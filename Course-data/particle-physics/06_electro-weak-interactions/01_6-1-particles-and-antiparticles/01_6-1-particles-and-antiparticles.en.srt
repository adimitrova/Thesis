00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:11,698
Hello and

3
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:15,790
welcome to the sixth module of our
introductory course of subatomic physics.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,099
In this sixth module, we discuss weak
interactions and the Higgs mechanism.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,180
You will notice that this module is again
larger than the average module.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,210
This is due to the rich phenomenology
of electro-weak interactions.

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,430
We recommend that you take
two weeks to digest it.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,510
Before diving into our subject, in this
first video we will go into more depth

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,000
on the subject of antiparticles.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,335
After following this video, you will know
the difference between particles and

11
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:47,302
antiparticles and

12
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:50,940
the connection between antiparticles and
energy-momentum reversal.

13
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,130
How do antiparticles come into
play in the standard model?

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,340
It all starts with
the evolution equation for

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,240
fields which takes the role of
an equation of motion for particles.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,780
It follows from relativistic
energy-momentum conservation by

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,650
operator substitution.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,770
The result is the Klein-Gordon
equation for free particles.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,280
Its solutions follow a continuity
equation as seen here.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,330
It describes the conversation of a 
four-vector current j^µ of particles.

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,210
The time component is the probability
density of finding a particle at

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,100
location x and t.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,240
Its spatial component is the particle
flow density at that same position.

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,250
Imagine an infinitely small
volume that surrounds

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,450
the point that we are considering.

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,970
The density in the volume can only
change – drho/dt not equal to zero –

27
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,860
if particles enter or exit through the
boundaries of the volume, which means that

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,960
divergence of j should then
simultaneously be non-equal to zero.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,130
This ensures that the number
of particles in the volume

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,870
is conserved.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,510
It might surprise you that
the probability density contains

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,090
the time derivative of the wave function.

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,510
We will understand this
fact in a little while.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,760
The Klein-Gordon equation is manifestly
covariant, it contains only scalars under

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,730
Lorenz transformation.

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,770
Plain waves must be a solution of
the Klein-Gordon equation, and

37
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,809
describe a free particle.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,920
We use a normalization proportional to
an arbitrary constant square root of N.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,910
You may take N as the number
density of particles if you wish.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,670
The current density is
proportional to the four-momentum.

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,460
Its temporal component is
proportional to the energy.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,820
This is due to the covariance
of the quantity.

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,990
It requires that the probability
rho d^3x is invariant.

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,640
The volume element changes like 
d^3x -> d^3x/gamma,

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,600
because of the Lorentz contraction
in the direction of motion.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,870
For invariance,

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,860
the probability density must then
change as rho -> gamma times rho.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,673
With gamma equal E/m,
rho must thus be proportional to energy.

49
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:15,016
It is for this reason that
the probability density and

50
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:19,630
current density contain respectively a
time and a space derivative of the field.

51
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:25,611
Let us now consider the energy eigenvalues
of relativistic free particles,

52
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:29,700
inserting a plane wave solution
into the Klein-Gordon equation.

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,840
We find solutions with positive and
with negative energy.

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,380
And since the density of probability
is proportional to the energy,

55
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,950
it is no more positive definite either.

56
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,830
This contradicts the definition of
probability as a real number between

57
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,540
zero and one.

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,820
To solve this problem we must interpret
the continuity equation in an innovative way,

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,690
introducing the electromagnetic
current density.

60
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,210
Proportional to the electric charge Q,

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,960
j^0 now becomes the local
charge density and thus,

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,920
may be negative as well as positive
in agreement with intuition.

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,900
It is obvious that
solutions of positive and

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,060
negative energy are distinguished by
the charge of the considered particle,

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,910
if one wants to keep the probability
density always positive.

66
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,010
It is thus not the probability density,
2N p^µ, which is invariant, but

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,560
the electromagnetic current density,
2Q N p^µ,

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,520
which obeys the rules for
physically sensible probabilities.

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,760
The current density is conserved
by the continuity equation.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,643
With this concept, we can very well
spontaneously create and annihilate particles,

71
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:44,175
provided that the total charge in an 
infinitesimal volume remains constant.

72
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:48,854
All of this is a consequence of
relativistic covariance only.

73
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,141
Which are the implications
of this reinterpretation for

74
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,980
the negative energy solutions?

75
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,950
The answer is given by Feynman's
interpretation of these states.

76
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,950
The electromagnetic current density of
a free electron with charge Q = -e,

77
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,480
ignoring its spin, is given
by the first equation.

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,990
This current is that of a particle with
positive energy advancing in the direction

79
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,330
of its momentum vector. Let us
say that it emerges from a vertex.

80
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,890
For a free positron, Q = +e,
the current is positive but

81
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,750
the current density is the same as for an
electron of negative energy which moves in

82
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,300
the opposite direction,
say entering into the vertex.

83
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,050
That is to say that the particle
with negative energy which

84
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,830
comes out of a vertex is equivalent to
an antiparticle with positive energy that

85
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,230
enters intervals.

86
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,730
In this way, we can eliminate
the solutions with negative energy, and

87
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,040
replace them by antiparticles
evolving in the opposite direction.

88
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,720
This establishes a connection between
the transformation between particles and

89
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,670
antiparticles, which we call
charge conjugation, and

90
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,310
the reversal of the direction
of momentum called parity.

91
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,730
These two transformations will be analyzed
in more detail in the next video.

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,250
But first, we look at the consequences
of Feynman's interpretation of negative

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,640
energy states.

94
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,480
These consequences are indeed quite
dramatic as shown by the example of

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,370
a simple double scattering process.

96
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,180
Heisenberg's Principle allows us
to reverse the order of the two

97
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,630
scatters in time.

98
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,430
The intermediate state will
then move backwards in time.

99
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,300
We replace it by its anti-particle
moving forward in time.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,985
The double scatter then becomes a pair
creation process as shown on the right

101
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:36,125
followed by a particle/anti-particle
annihilation process.

102
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,815
Both contributions begin with
the same initial state and

103
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,175
end up with the same final state.

104
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:45,125
We must thus sum them at
the level of amplitudes

105
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,035
when calculating the total
probability of the process.

106
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,125
When calculating simple scatters,

107
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,565
it is sufficient to consider particles,
the corresponding anti-particle

108
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,690
process can be obtained by reversing
the direction of the particles.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,665
In the next vide, we introduce the
discreet transformations of space time,

110
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:08,063
parity, and time reversal and charge
conjugation, which transforms the wave

111
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:11,825
function of a particle into that of
an anti particle and vise versa.
