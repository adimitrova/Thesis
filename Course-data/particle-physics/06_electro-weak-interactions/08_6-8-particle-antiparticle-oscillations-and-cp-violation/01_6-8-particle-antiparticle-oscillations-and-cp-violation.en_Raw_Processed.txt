in sixth module we 
discussing weak interactions 
in this eighth video, we will 
talk violation cp 
symmetry between particles 
antiparticles weak interactions 
following this video you will 
able to describe condition 
oscillation between particles 
antiparticles mechanism 
you will able to explain 
violation joint symmetry cp in 
quark sector 
cabibbokobayashimaskawa matrix must 
unitary necessarily real 
this allows a nontrivial complex 
phase cannot removed 
a global rotation in flavor space 
existence 
a phase important 
consequences that we will 
discuss in following 
first a reminder 
we already saw in video , 
that weak interaction 
maximally violates parity p 
a good example is decay 
dominant decay channel is 
nu 
neutrino produced in decay 
must lefthanded 
structure interaction 
pion is a scalar particle, 
must also lefthanded 
is allowed to extent 
that is mass is nonnegligible 
allows to wrong helicity 
mirror decay, contrary, 
will produce 
correct helicity is observed all, 
w interact 
righthanded neutrinos 
this explains decay 
an electron, goes to electron a 
lefthanded electron neutrino is so 
much this disfavored, 
despite much larger 
phase space factor 
small mass electron requires 
much to correct 
helicity thus suppresses 
amplitude this process 
decay charged pion 
violates time 
charge conjugation symmetry c 
this operation we obtain 
a reaction that is forbidden fact 
that w couple 
to lefthanded antineutrinos 
to righthanded antineutrino 
since symmetries c 
p violated in a maximum 
fashion charged weak interactions, 
one might expect that combined 
symmetry cp will respected 
this is indeed case in 
example shown so far 
pion, is simple to 
verify that operation cp 
converts decay 
decay, 
good helicity neutrinos 
bad ones muons admitted 
muons nonrelativistic 
this processes therefore cp 
eigenstates amplitude 
this is case 
intergeneration weak 
processes mediated w boson 
lets look neutral mesons, 
like k, contains a d quark 
an sbar quark, b, 
contains a d quark a bbar quark 
converted 
antiparticle a secondorder process 
this reaction is obviously 
possible 
particles that 
carry kind charge 
pseudoscalar meson k, example, 
is an eigenstate parity 
charge conjugation 
this operation changes strangeness 
k contains an antiquark sbar, 
so strangeness plus 
kbar contains a quark s, so 
strangeness 
therefore neither k 
kbar eigenstates cp 
one construct 
linear combinations, k 
k, that eigenstates cp 
if cp is conserved, two 
states decay weak interactions 
if eigenvalue cp 
conserved weak interaction, 
eigenstates k 
k will decay weak forces final 
states contains two pions 
three pions, respectively 
final states 
right cp properties 
this is approximately true 
states k k almost 
identical to particles ks 
kl found in list 
particle data group 
two different phase 
space factors, one finds that lifetime 
ks is much shorter 
one kl, 
explains name 
identification 
ks almost equal to k 
kl equal to k is perfect 
first, two masses 
quite same, 
differ ev 
mass difference produces 
oscillation between particles 
antiparticles in time, 
states evolving 
velocity energy 
is 
imagine a k meson 
rest in vacuum 
wave function evolves according to 
mass width gamma 
probability density to find k time 
is given evolution equation 
free particles 
reasoning is valid k 
mass m width gamma 
since strong interaction conserve 
flavors, including strangeness, 
state produced strong 
interaction will a definite 
strangeness, like k kbar 
if one produces, instance, 
a k , 
well a mixture equal 
quantities k k that time 
two components 
evolving differently 
small 
mass difference m 
a later time t, 
we therefore find a different mixture 
if we thus measure strangeness 
state a function time, 
example a stronger interaction, 
we find that 
oscillates between k 
kbar frequency m 
so far combined symmetry 
cp is still respected 
one finds that 
longlived particle, 
kl, is almost equal to k, 
a low probability to decay , 
a state wrong cp eigenvalue 
one must thus admit that kl also 
contains a small amplitude k 
coefficient epsilon 
is , 
is certainly small, 
consequently, charged weak 
interaction violates also 
combined symmetry cp, 
a little bit 
this means that amplitudes 
charged weak interaction 
matter 
antimatter slightly different 
so nature therefore foreseen 
an objective way to distinguish 
a complex phase in 
cabibbokobayashimaskawa 
matrix allows to introduce this 
little asymmetry in mixing quark 
states involved in weak interactions, 
a phase angle theta, 
is degrees 
this describes phenomenon using 
ckm matrix, explain 
cp violation in weak interaction 
is a subject active current 
research in kaon sector 
in b sector 
next video will discuss 
neutrino interactions 
among rare 
processes in particle physics
