00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:12,925
In the sixth module we
are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:18,512
And in this eighth video, we will
talk about the violation of the CP

4
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:25,170
symmetry between particles and
antiparticles by weak interactions.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,620
After following this video you will
be able to describe the condition for

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,040
oscillation between particles and
antiparticles and their mechanism.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,830
And you will be able to explain
the violation of the joint symmetry CP in

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,980
the quark sector.

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,710
The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix must
be unitary but not necessarily real.

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,410
This allows a non-trivial complex
phase which cannot be removed

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,060
by a global rotation in flavor space.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,007
The existence of such
a phase has very important

13
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,440
consequences that we will
discuss in the following.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,010
But first a reminder.
We already saw in video 6.3,

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,740
that the weak interaction
maximally violates parity P.

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,250
A good example is the π+ decay.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,430
The dominant decay channel is 
π+ -> µ+ nu_µ.

18
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,804
The neutrino produced in the decay
must be left-handed because of

19
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,198
the structure of the interaction.

20
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:39,588
As the pion is a scalar particle,
the µ+ must also be left-handed.

21
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:42,207
Which is allowed to the extent

22
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:48,420
that is mass is non-negligible and
allows it to have the « wrong » helicity.

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,048
The mirror decay, on the contrary,

24
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:56,677
which will produce µ+ of the 
« correct » helicity is not observed at all,

25
00:01:56,677 --> 00:02:02,465
because the W does not interact
with right-handed neutrinos.

26
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:06,554
This explains why the decay into
an electron, π+ goes to electron and a

27
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:12,303
left-handed electron neutrino is so
much this disfavored,

28
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:16,626
despite it's much larger
phase space factor.

29
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:22,134
The small mass of the electron requires
it much more to have the « correct »

30
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:26,010
helicity and thus suppresses
the amplitude of this process.

31
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,002
The decay of the charged pion
violates at the same time the

32
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,450
charge conjugation symmetry C.

33
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,229
Under this operation we obtain
a reaction that is forbidden by the fact

34
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,927
that the the W does not couple at
all to left-handed antineutrinos but

35
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:47,640
only to the right-handed antineutrino.

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,370
Since the symmetries of C and

37
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,680
P are both violated in a maximum
fashion by charged weak interactions,

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,840
one might expect that the combined
symmetry CP will be respected.

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,083
This is indeed the case in
the example shown so far.

40
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:09,672
For the pion, it is simple to
verify that the operation CP

41
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:14,355
converts the π+ decay
into the π- decay,

42
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:18,170
with the good helicity for the neutrinos.

43
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,258
But the bad ones for muons are admitted
because muons are non-relativistic.

44
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:30,200
This processes are therefore CP
eigenstates with the same amplitude.

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,136
But this is not the case for

46
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:40,000
all the inter-generation weak
processes mediated by the W boson.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,448
Let's look at the neutral mesons,
like K0, which contains a d quark and

48
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:52,282
an sbar quark, or B0, which
contains a d quark and a bbar quark.

49
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:57,481
These can be converted into their own 
antiparticle by a second-order process.

50
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,531
This reaction is obviously
only possible for

51
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,610
particles that do not
carry any kind of charge.

52
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,959
The pseudoscalar meson K0, for example,
is an eigenstate of parity but

53
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,593
not of charge conjugation because
this operation changes strangeness.

54
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:21,626
K0 contains an antiquark sbar,
so it has strangeness plus 1.

55
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:26,929
K0-bar contains a quark s, so
it has strangeness -1.

56
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:32,259
Therefore neither K0 nor
K0-bar are eigenstates of CP.

57
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,229
But one can construct
linear combinations, K1 and

58
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,441
K2, that are eigenstates of CP.

59
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:47,440
If CP is conserved, it should be these two
states which decay by weak interactions.

60
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,220
If the eigenvalue of CP were
conserved by weak interaction,

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,990
the eigenstates K1 and
K2 will decay by weak forces into final

62
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,036
states which contains two pions and
three pions, respectively.

63
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,400
These final states have
the right CP properties.

64
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,650
This is approximately true.

65
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,408
The states K1 and K2 are almost
identical to the particles K0_S and

66
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:19,008
K0_L found in the list
of the Particle Data Group.

67
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:24,280
Because of the two very different phase
space factors, one finds that the lifetime

68
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,300
of the K0_S is much shorter
than the one of the K0_L,

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,715
which explains their name.

70
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:36,294
But their identification 
K0_S almost equal to K1 and

71
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,126
K0_L equal to K2 is not perfect.

72
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:42,168
First, the two masses
are not quite the same,

73
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,922
they differ by some µeV.

74
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:49,102
The mass difference produces
oscillation between particles and

75
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:51,582
antiparticles in time,

76
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:56,252
because both states are not evolving
with the same velocity when their energy

77
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:57,322
is the same.

78
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:05,084
Imagine a K1 meson at 
t = 0 at rest in vacuum.

79
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:10,898
Its wave function evolves according to
its mass am_1 and width Gamma_1.

80
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:16,580
The probability density to find K1 at time
t is given by the evolution equation for

81
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,265
free particles.

82
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:23,850
The same reasoning is valid for K2 but
with mass m_2 and width Gamma_2.

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,630
Since the strong interaction conserve
flavors, including strangeness,

84
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,110
the state produced by strong
interaction will have a definite

85
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,550
strangeness, like K0 or K0-bar.

86
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,910
If one produces, for instance,
a K0 at t = 0,

87
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,060
we'll have a mixture of equal
quantities of K1 and K2 at that time.

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Now the two components
are evolving differently

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,220
because of the small
mass difference ∆m.

90
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,620
At a later time t,
we therefore find a different mixture.

91
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,627
If we thus measure the strangeness
of the state as a function of time,

92
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:08,598
for example by a stronger interaction,
we find that it

93
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:15,010
oscillates between K0 and
K0-bar with the frequency ∆m.

94
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,361
So far the combined symmetry
CP is still respected.

95
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:25,104
But one finds that
the long-lived particle,

96
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:29,238
K0_L, which is almost equal to K2,

97
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:34,850
has a low probability to decay into π+ π-, 
a state which has the wrong CP eigenvalue. 

98
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,010
One must thus admit that K0_L also
contains a small amplitude of K1.

99
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,409
The coefficient epsilon
is 2.3 10^-3,

100
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,700
which is certainly small, but not 0.

101
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,840
Consequently, charged weak
interaction violates also

102
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,500
the combined symmetry CP,
but only a little bit.

103
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,969
This means that the amplitudes
of charged weak interaction for

104
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,276
matter and
antimatter are slightly different.

105
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:13,110
So nature has therefore foreseen
an objective way to distinguish them.

106
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,126
A complex phase in
the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa

107
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:22,899
matrix allows to introduce this
little asymmetry in the mixing of quark

108
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,160
states involved in weak interactions,

109
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,192
with a phase angle theta,
which is about 45 degrees.

110
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:37,010
This describes the phenomenon using
the CKM matrix, but does not explain it.

111
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,188
CP violation in weak interaction
is a subject of active current

112
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:49,256
research both in the kaon sector and
in the B0 sector.

113
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:54,363
The next video will discuss
neutrino interactions

114
00:08:54,363 --> 00:09:00,693
which are among the most rare
processes in particle physics.
