in
the
sixth
module
we
are
discussing
weak
interactions
.
and
in
this
eighth
video
,
we
will
talk
about
the
violation
of
the
cp
symmetry
between
particles
and
antiparticles
by
weak
interactions
.
after
following
this
video
you
will
be
able
to
describe
the
condition
for
oscillation
between
particles
and
antiparticles
and
their
mechanism
.
and
you
will
be
able
to
explain
the
violation
of
the
joint
symmetry
cp
in
the
quark
sector
.
the
cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa
matrix
must
be
unitary
but
not
necessarily
real
.
this
allows
a
non-trivial
complex
phase
which
can
not
be
removed
by
a
global
rotation
in
flavor
space
.
the
existence
of
such
a
phase
has
very
important
consequences
that
we
will
discuss
in
the
following
.
but
first
a
reminder
.
we
already
saw
in
video
6.3
,
that
the
weak
interaction
maximally
violates
parity
p.
a
good
example
is
the
Ã¯Â+
decay
.
the
dominant
decay
channel
is
Ã¯Â+
-
>
Ã¢Âµ+
nu_Ã¢Âµ
.
the
neutrino
produced
in
the
decay
must
be
left-handed
because
of
the
structure
of
the
interaction
.
as
the
pion
is
a
scalar
particle
,
the
Ã¢Âµ+
must
also
be
left-handed
.
which
is
allowed
to
the
extent
that
is
mass
is
non-negligible
and
allows
it
to
have
the
Ã¢Â
«
Ã¢Â
wrongÃ¢Â
Ã¢Â
»
helicity
.
the
mirror
decay
,
on
the
contrary
,
which
will
produce
Ã¢Âµ+
of
the
Ã¢Â
«
Ã¢Â
correctÃ¢Â
Ã¢Â
»
helicity
is
not
observed
at
all
,
because
the
w
does
not
interact
with
right-handed
neutrinos
.
this
explains
why
the
decay
into
an
electron
,
Ã¯Â+
goes
to
electron
and
a
left-handed
electron
neutrino
is
so
much
this
disfavored
,
despite
it
's
much
larger
phase
space
factor
.
the
small
mass
of
the
electron
requires
it
much
more
to
have
the
Ã¢Â
«
Ã¢Â
correctÃ¢Â
Ã¢Â
»
helicity
and
thus
suppresses
the
amplitude
of
this
process
.
the
decay
of
the
charged
pion
violates
at
the
same
time
the
charge
conjugation
symmetry
c.
under
this
operation
we
obtain
a
reaction
that
is
forbidden
by
the
fact
that
the
the
w
does
not
couple
at
all
to
left-handed
antineutrinos
but
only
to
the
right-handed
antineutrino
.
since
the
symmetries
of
c
and
p
are
both
violated
in
a
maximum
fashion
by
charged
weak
interactions
,
one
might
expect
that
the
combined
symmetry
cp
will
be
respected
.
this
is
indeed
the
case
in
the
example
shown
so
far
.
for
the
pion
,
it
is
simple
to
verify
that
the
operation
cp
converts
the
Ã¯Â+
decay
into
the
Ã¯Â-
decay
,
with
the
good
helicity
for
the
neutrinos
.
but
the
bad
ones
for
muons
are
admitted
because
muons
are
non-relativistic
.
this
processes
are
therefore
cp
eigenstates
with
the
same
amplitude
.
but
this
is
not
the
case
for
all
the
inter-generation
weak
processes
mediated
by
the
w
boson
.
let
's
look
at
the
neutral
mesons
,
like
k0
,
which
contains
a
d
quark
and
an
sbar
quark
,
or
b0
,
which
contains
a
d
quark
and
a
bbar
quark
.
these
can
be
converted
into
their
own
antiparticle
by
a
second-order
process
.
this
reaction
is
obviously
only
possible
for
particles
that
do
not
carry
any
kind
of
charge
.
the
pseudoscalar
meson
k0
,
for
example
,
is
an
eigenstate
of
parity
but
not
of
charge
conjugation
because
this
operation
changes
strangeness
.
k0
contains
an
antiquark
sbar
,
so
it
has
strangeness
plus
1.
k0-bar
contains
a
quark
s
,
so
it
has
strangeness
-1.
therefore
neither
k0
nor
k0-bar
are
eigenstates
of
cp
.
but
one
can
construct
linear
combinations
,
k1
and
k2
,
that
are
eigenstates
of
cp
.
if
cp
is
conserved
,
it
should
be
these
two
states
which
decay
by
weak
interactions
.
if
the
eigenvalue
of
cp
were
conserved
by
weak
interaction
,
the
eigenstates
k1
and
k2
will
decay
by
weak
forces
into
final
states
which
contains
two
pions
and
three
pions
,
respectively
.
these
final
states
have
the
right
cp
properties
.
this
is
approximately
true
.
the
states
k1
and
k2
are
almost
identical
to
the
particles
k0_s
and
k0_l
found
in
the
list
of
the
particle
data
group
.
because
of
the
two
very
different
phase
space
factors
,
one
finds
that
the
lifetime
of
the
k0_s
is
much
shorter
than
the
one
of
the
k0_l
,
which
explains
their
name
.
but
their
identification
k0_s
almost
equal
to
k1
and
k0_l
equal
to
k2
is
not
perfect
.
first
,
the
two
masses
are
not
quite
the
same
,
they
differ
by
some
Ã¢Âµev
.
the
mass
difference
produces
oscillation
between
particles
and
antiparticles
in
time
,
because
both
states
are
not
evolving
with
the
same
velocity
when
their
energy
is
the
same
.
imagine
a
k1
meson
at
t
=
0
at
rest
in
vacuum
.
its
wave
function
evolves
according
to
its
mass
am_1
and
width
gamma_1
.
the
probability
density
to
find
k1
at
time
t
is
given
by
the
evolution
equation
for
free
particles
.
the
same
reasoning
is
valid
for
k2
but
with
mass
m_2
and
width
gamma_2
.
since
the
strong
interaction
conserve
flavors
,
including
strangeness
,
the
state
produced
by
strong
interaction
will
have
a
definite
strangeness
,
like
k0
or
k0-bar
.
if
one
produces
,
for
instance
,
a
k0
at
t
=
0
,
we
'll
have
a
mixture
of
equal
quantities
of
k1
and
k2
at
that
time
.
now
the
two
components
are
evolving
differently
because
of
the
small
mass
difference
Ã¢ÂÂm
.
at
a
later
time
t
,
we
therefore
find
a
different
mixture
.
if
we
thus
measure
the
strangeness
of
the
state
as
a
function
of
time
,
for
example
by
a
stronger
interaction
,
we
find
that
it
oscillates
between
k0
and
k0-bar
with
the
frequency
Ã¢ÂÂm
.
so
far
the
combined
symmetry
cp
is
still
respected
.
but
one
finds
that
the
long-lived
particle
,
k0_l
,
which
is
almost
equal
to
k2
,
has
a
low
probability
to
decay
into
Ã¯Â+
Ã¯Â-
,
a
state
which
has
the
wrong
cp
eigenvalue
.
one
must
thus
admit
that
k0_l
also
contains
a
small
amplitude
of
k1
.
the
coefficient
epsilon
is
2.3
10^-3
,
which
is
certainly
small
,
but
not
0.
consequently
,
charged
weak
interaction
violates
also
the
combined
symmetry
cp
,
but
only
a
little
bit
.
this
means
that
the
amplitudes
of
charged
weak
interaction
for
matter
and
antimatter
are
slightly
different
.
so
nature
has
therefore
foreseen
an
objective
way
to
distinguish
them
.
a
complex
phase
in
the
cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa
matrix
allows
to
introduce
this
little
asymmetry
in
the
mixing
of
quark
states
involved
in
weak
interactions
,
with
a
phase
angle
theta
,
which
is
about
45
degrees
.
this
describes
the
phenomenon
using
the
ckm
matrix
,
but
does
not
explain
it
.
cp
violation
in
weak
interaction
is
a
subject
of
active
current
research
both
in
the
kaon
sector
and
in
the
b0
sector
.
the
next
video
will
discuss
neutrino
interactions
which
are
among
the
most
rare
processes
in
particle
physics
.
