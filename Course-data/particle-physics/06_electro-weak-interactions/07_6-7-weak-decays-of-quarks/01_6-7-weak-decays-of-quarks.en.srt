00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,486
In the 6th module we
are discussing weak interaction.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,190
And in this 7th video

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,590
we'll talk about quark decays
mediated by weak interactions.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,140
After following this video,
you will know the quark decay mechanism,

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,030
which is analogous to the muon decay,
we discussed in video 6.4,

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,400
and you will know the quantum nature of
quark states which interacts with W bosons.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,097
And the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix,

9
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:43,341
which describes these mixtures
in the Standard Model.

10
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:50,368
The couplings of quarks to the W±
privilege those between members

11
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:56,883
of the same generation, but they also
exist across generation boundaries.

12
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:00,095
Pion decay is an example for the dominant case,

13
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:05,125
where the W connects an up
quark to a down quark.

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,545
An example of an intergeneration
decay is the kaon decay,

15
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:13,900
where the W boson connects
an up quark to a strange quark.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,570
In the Feynman diagrams shown here,

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,900
we have again replaced the incoming
antiquarks by outgoing quarks.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,680
The ratio of the two partial rates
is measured to be of order 1.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,596
These experimental results show that
kaon decay is very much disfavored.

20
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:35,936
The kaon phase space is large compared
to the pion due to it's large mass.

21
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:40,845
Neglecting moun and neutrino
masses, the decay width is proportion to

22
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:43,985
the parent particle mass to the 5th power.

23
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:47,571
The ratio is thus expected to be 100 times larger.

24
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:52,045
It must be concluded
that the intergeneration

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:57,666
interactions are disfavored
compared to intrageneration

26
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,939
interactions by at least
a factor of 100 in the rate or

27
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,470
a factor of 10 in the amplitude.

28
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,770
In 1963, Nicola Cabibbo proposed
a way to describe these processes.

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,040
States which interact with the W±
are not the quarks which are listed

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,065
in the periodic table of matter particles,
which we presented in module 1.

31
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,958
The particles, which interact with
the W bosons, are the mixtures

32
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:32,930
d’, s’, and b’, quantum superposition of

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,010
the real quarks d, s and b.

34
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,560
The states, d’, s’, and b’
are not eigenstates of the mass operator.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,940
So they are not real particles
which evolve in space time, but

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,240
they come from a rotation
in flavor space.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,220
Since these rotations will not change the
number of fermions, the operator must be unitary.

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,280
For two generation
the description is simplified.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,212
In the formula we see symbolic
substitute the wave function of the quarks

40
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,660
with the name of the quark.

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,080
The angle of rotation between the first
two generations, theta_C, is called the Cabibbo angle.

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,706
The mixing corresponds to
a modification of the weak

43
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:25,790
charged quark current.
A small strange quark amplitude s is added

44
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,880
to the down quark wave function and
vice versa.

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,215
As a consequence the amplitudes of
the weak interaction of quarks change.

46
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:40,885
For dominant interactions of
the W with the u-d current, for example,

47
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:45,258
the rotation induces a factor
cosine theta_C in the amplitude.

48
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:52,676
For disfavored interactions, such as those
with a u-s current, the factor sine theta_C appears.

49
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:57,519
The relative rates of the two types
of interaction are thus redused by

50
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,123
a factor tangent squared of theta C.

51
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:03,870
From the observed rate reduction
with respect to the phase space

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,210
one finds a  Cabibbo rotation
angle of about 13 degrees.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,640
This consideration must be generalized
to 3 generations of quarks.

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,420
Matrix notation is introduced between
states, which appear in the weak

55
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,020
charged quark current, that is d’,
s’ and b’,

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,650
and the real quarks d, s and b.

57
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,570
The unity matrix V_ckm

58
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,487
is called the Cabibbo-Kobayash-Maskawa matrix
after the names of its inventors.

59
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:43,243
The Particle Data Group compiles the values of
these elements from many different

60
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,490
measurements.

61
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,960
These matrix elements appear
at each vertex of the W±

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,820
with a pair of quarks.

63
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,290
Absolute values are measured by comparing
decay rates of each type except for

64
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:03,500
top quark interaction where they are
derived from the unitarity of the matrix.

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,570
The matrix elements become smaller
as one deviates from the diagonal.

66
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,980
This means that intra-generation
interactions dominate the weak

67
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,815
charged current.

68
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:21,440
Inter-generation interactions jumping
a single generation are disfavored.

69
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,980
Those which bridge two generation,
even more.

70
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,625
The structure of the matrix
thus favors decay cascade,

71
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:36,970
like the one of the top quark shown here.

72
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,924
Note that the unitarity allows
the matrix elements to be complex,

73
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,714
therefore a non-trivial phase
angle may appear in the matrix.

74
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:50,032
This factor makes amplitudes non-invariant
under the operation CP,

75
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:55,270
the symmetry between matter and
anti-matter.

76
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,557
We will talk about violation of matter-
antimatter symmetry in the next video.
