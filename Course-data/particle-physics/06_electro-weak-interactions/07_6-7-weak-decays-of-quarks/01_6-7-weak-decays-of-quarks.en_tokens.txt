in
the
6th
module
we
are
discussing
weak
interaction
.
and
in
this
7th
video
we
'll
talk
about
quark
decays
mediated
by
weak
interactions
.
after
following
this
video
,
you
will
know
the
quark
decay
mechanism
,
which
is
analogous
to
the
muon
decay
,
we
discussed
in
video
6.4
,
and
you
will
know
the
quantum
nature
of
quark
states
which
interacts
with
w
bosons
.
and
the
cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa
matrix
,
which
describes
these
mixtures
in
the
standard
model
.
the
couplings
of
quarks
to
the
wÃ¢Â±
privilege
those
between
members
of
the
same
generation
,
but
they
also
exist
across
generation
boundaries
.
pion
decay
is
an
example
for
the
dominant
case
,
where
the
w
connects
an
up
quark
to
a
down
quark
.
an
example
of
an
intergeneration
decay
is
the
kaon
decay
,
where
the
w
boson
connects
an
up
quark
to
a
strange
quark
.
in
the
feynman
diagrams
shown
here
,
we
have
again
replaced
the
incoming
antiquarks
by
outgoing
quarks
.
the
ratio
of
the
two
partial
rates
is
measured
to
be
of
order
1.
these
experimental
results
show
that
kaon
decay
is
very
much
disfavored
.
the
kaon
phase
space
is
large
compared
to
the
pion
due
to
it
's
large
mass
.
neglecting
moun
and
neutrino
masses
,
the
decay
width
is
proportion
to
the
parent
particle
mass
to
the
5th
power
.
the
ratio
is
thus
expected
to
be
100
times
larger
.
it
must
be
concluded
that
the
intergeneration
interactions
are
disfavored
compared
to
intrageneration
interactions
by
at
least
a
factor
of
100
in
the
rate
or
a
factor
of
10
in
the
amplitude
.
in
1963
,
nicola
cabibbo
proposed
a
way
to
describe
these
processes
.
states
which
interact
with
the
wÃ¢Â±
are
not
the
quarks
which
are
listed
in
the
periodic
table
of
matter
particles
,
which
we
presented
in
module
1.
the
particles
,
which
interact
with
the
w
bosons
,
are
the
mixtures
dÃ¢ÂÂ
,
sÃ¢ÂÂ
,
and
bÃ¢ÂÂ
,
quantum
superposition
of
the
real
quarks
d
,
s
and
b.
the
states
,
dÃ¢ÂÂ
,
sÃ¢ÂÂ
,
and
bÃ¢ÂÂ
are
not
eigenstates
of
the
mass
operator
.
so
they
are
not
real
particles
which
evolve
in
space
time
,
but
they
come
from
a
rotation
in
flavor
space
.
since
these
rotations
will
not
change
the
number
of
fermions
,
the
operator
must
be
unitary
.
for
two
generation
the
description
is
simplified
.
in
the
formula
we
see
symbolic
substitute
the
wave
function
of
the
quarks
with
the
name
of
the
quark
.
the
angle
of
rotation
between
the
first
two
generations
,
theta_c
,
is
called
the
cabibbo
angle
.
the
mixing
corresponds
to
a
modification
of
the
weak
charged
quark
current
.
a
small
strange
quark
amplitude
s
is
added
to
the
down
quark
wave
function
and
vice
versa
.
as
a
consequence
the
amplitudes
of
the
weak
interaction
of
quarks
change
.
for
dominant
interactions
of
the
w
with
the
u-d
current
,
for
example
,
the
rotation
induces
a
factor
cosine
theta_c
in
the
amplitude
.
for
disfavored
interactions
,
such
as
those
with
a
u-s
current
,
the
factor
sine
theta_c
appears
.
the
relative
rates
of
the
two
types
of
interaction
are
thus
redused
by
a
factor
tangent
squared
of
theta
c.
from
the
observed
rate
reduction
with
respect
to
the
phase
space
one
finds
a
cabibbo
rotation
angle
of
about
13
degrees
.
this
consideration
must
be
generalized
to
3
generations
of
quarks
.
matrix
notation
is
introduced
between
states
,
which
appear
in
the
weak
charged
quark
current
,
that
is
dÃ¢ÂÂ
,
sÃ¢ÂÂ
and
bÃ¢ÂÂ
,
and
the
real
quarks
d
,
s
and
b.
the
unity
matrix
v_ckm
is
called
the
cabibbo-kobayash-maskawa
matrix
after
the
names
of
its
inventors
.
the
particle
data
group
compiles
the
values
of
these
elements
from
many
different
measurements
.
these
matrix
elements
appear
at
each
vertex
of
the
wÃ¢Â±
with
a
pair
of
quarks
.
absolute
values
are
measured
by
comparing
decay
rates
of
each
type
except
for
top
quark
interaction
where
they
are
derived
from
the
unitarity
of
the
matrix
.
the
matrix
elements
become
smaller
as
one
deviates
from
the
diagonal
.
this
means
that
intra-generation
interactions
dominate
the
weak
charged
current
.
inter-generation
interactions
jumping
a
single
generation
are
disfavored
.
those
which
bridge
two
generation
,
even
more
.
the
structure
of
the
matrix
thus
favors
decay
cascade
,
like
the
one
of
the
top
quark
shown
here
.
note
that
the
unitarity
allows
the
matrix
elements
to
be
complex
,
therefore
a
non-trivial
phase
angle
may
appear
in
the
matrix
.
this
factor
makes
amplitudes
non-invariant
under
the
operation
cp
,
the
symmetry
between
matter
and
anti-matter
.
we
will
talk
about
violation
of
matter-
antimatter
symmetry
in
the
next
video
.
