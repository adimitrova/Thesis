in th module we 
discussing weak interaction 
in this th video 
well talk quark decays 
mediated weak interactions 
following this video, 
you will know quark decay mechanism, 
is analogous to muon decay, 
we discussed in video , 
you will know quantum nature 
quark states interacts w bosons 
cabibbokobayashimaskawa matrix, 
describes mixtures 
in standard model 
couplings quarks to w 
privilege between members 
generation, also 
exist across generation boundaries 
pion decay is an example dominant case, 
w connects an 
quark to a quark 
an example an intergeneration 
decay is kaon decay, 
w boson connects 
an quark to a strange quark 
in feynman diagrams shown here, 
we replaced incoming 
antiquarks outgoing quarks 
ratio two partial rates 
is measured to order 
experimental results show that 
kaon decay is much disfavored 
kaon phase space is large compared 
to pion due to large mass 
neglecting moun neutrino 
masses, decay width is proportion to 
parent particle mass to th power 
ratio is thus expected to times larger 
must concluded 
that intergeneration 
interactions disfavored 
compared to intrageneration 
interactions least 
a factor in rate 
a factor in amplitude 
in , nicola cabibbo proposed 
a way to describe processes 
states interact w 
quarks listed 
in periodic table matter particles, 
we presented in module 
particles, interact 
w bosons, mixtures 
d, s, b, quantum superposition 
real quarks d, b 
states, d, s, b 
eigenstates mass operator 
so real particles 
evolve in space time, 
come a rotation 
in flavor space 
since rotations will change 
number fermions, operator must unitary 
two generation 
description is simplified 
in formula we see symbolic 
substitute wave function quarks 
name quark 
angle rotation between first 
two generations, thetac, is called cabibbo angle 
mixing corresponds to 
a modification weak 
charged quark current 
a small strange quark amplitude is added 
to quark wave function 
vice versa 
a consequence amplitudes 
weak interaction quarks change 
dominant interactions 
w ud current, example, 
rotation induces a factor 
cosine thetac in amplitude 
disfavored interactions, 
a us current, factor sine thetac appears 
relative rates two types 
interaction thus redused 
a factor tangent squared theta c 
observed rate reduction 
respect to phase space 
one finds a cabibbo rotation 
angle degrees 
this consideration must generalized 
to generations quarks 
matrix notation is introduced between 
states, appear in weak 
charged quark current, that is d, 
b, 
real quarks d, b 
unity matrix vckm 
is called cabibbokobayashmaskawa matrix 
names inventors 
particle data group compiles values 
elements many different 
measurements 
matrix elements appear 
vertex w 
a pair quarks 
absolute values measured comparing 
decay rates type except 
top quark interaction 
derived unitarity matrix 
matrix elements become smaller 
one deviates diagonal 
this means that intrageneration 
interactions dominate weak 
charged current 
intergeneration interactions jumping 
a single generation disfavored 
bridge two generation, 
even 
structure matrix 
thus favors decay cascade, 
like one top quark shown here 
note that unitarity allows 
matrix elements to complex, 
therefore a nontrivial phase 
angle may appear in matrix 
this factor makes amplitudes noninvariant 
operation cp,
