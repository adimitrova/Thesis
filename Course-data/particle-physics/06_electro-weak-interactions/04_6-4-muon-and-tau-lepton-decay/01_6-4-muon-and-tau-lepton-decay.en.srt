2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,412
In the sixth module,
we are discussing weak interaction.

3
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:19,159
And in this fourth video,
we discuss a prototype process of charged

4
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:23,925
weak interactions, the leptonic
interaction of the W boson.

5
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:28,950
After following this video, you will know
how to describe the decays of muon and

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,805
tau leptons,
in terms of a Feynman diagram.

7
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:37,061
And how to discuss the properties
of this interaction quantitatively.

8
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,318
Here is the Feynman diagram for
muon decay.

9
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:45,717
The emission of the W- converts
the muon into a muon neutrino.

10
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:52,600
The virtual W then decays into
an electron - electron-antineutrino pair.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,187
This way the lepton number
weak isospin and

12
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:58,280
other quantum numbers, are conserved.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,338
In the diagram, we already converted
the outgoing antineutrino into an incoming

14
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:10,673
neutrino, by inverting its charge and
four-momentum, k’ into -k’.

15
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:14,985
In the amplitude, the W propagator
contributes a factor of one over q^2

16
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,380
minus the mass squared of the W,

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,456
which weakens the amplitude for

18
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:23,174
q^s much smaller than
the square of the mass of the W.

19
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:26,046
At low momentum transfers, like for

20
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:29,681
light particles decays where
q^2 is smaller or

21
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:34,751
equal to the square of the mass of
the muon, that is, it is negligible,

22
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:41,370
the propagator is constant and equal to
the inverse of the square mass of the W.

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,546
We can then treat this process in the 
so-called Fermi approximation.

24
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:51,020
By convention, one absorbs this
residual of the W propagator

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,610
with the square of the coupling constant
g^2, to form the Fermi constant G_F.

26
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,170
It takes the role of the fine structure
constant for weak interactions.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,843
In this approximation, valid at low
momentum transfers, weak interactions

28
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:14,897
can be described by a direct interaction
between two current densities.

29
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:19,111
The transition currents corresponding
to charged and weak interactions,

30
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,190
are similar to the electromagnetic ones.

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,980
One denotes them in an imprecise manner,
as charged currents CC.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,501
Analogously, the interaction
of the Z boson at low energy,

33
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,288
that is q^2 much smaller than
the square of the mass of the Z,

34
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:42,980
can be approximated by direct interaction
of two neutral currents, NC.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,249
The constant rho involves the Weinberg
angular theta_W, which measures

36
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:54,437
the ratio between the coupling constants
of the weak charged and neutral interactions.

37
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:58,160
The constant rho is equal
to one with good precision.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,090
This is due to the fact that in
the Standard Theory of electroweak

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,300
interaction, the masses of the vector
bosons and the coupling constants

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,695
are connected by the Higgs mechanism,
which we will discuss in video 6.11.

41
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:18,060
High-precision experimental
results verify this relationship.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,420
The differencial muon decay rate,
neglecting the mass of the electron,

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,020
which is much smaller that
the mass of the muon,

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,400
is given here as a function of the energy
E’ of the outgoing electron.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,018
This energy can vary between zero and
half the mass of the muon.

46
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:40,864
As this process is virtually
the only decay channel,

47
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:45,410
the total rate is obtained
by integrating over E’.

48
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,629
The measure of a lifetime of
the muon is close to 

49
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,810
2.2 10^-6 s.

50
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,817
We thus find a Fermi constant G_F

51
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:59,770
of about 10^-5 inverse GeV squared.

52
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,970
The factor m^5 comes in
through the phase-space factor,

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,570
which enters into the calculation of Gamma.

54
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,260
Therefore we find the same formula for
other weak decays,

55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,781
especially for the tau decay.

56
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:21,270
It does on the other hand, not directly
correspond to the total decay rate,

57
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:27,090
because the tau has other important
decay channels due its large mass.

58
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,743
So Gamma for the specific
decay is just a partial width,

59
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:37,196
we must take into account
the branching fraction in the numerator.

60
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:41,923
One of the most precise experiments
that measure the muon lifetime,

61
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:46,427
is MuLan at the Paul Scherrer
institute at Villigen in Switzerland.

62
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:52,630
A mu+ beam enters from the left,
and is stopped in a target.

63
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,510
The scintillator ball surrounding the target
registers the positrons from the decay,

64
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,580
and measures their emission times.

65
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,770
The number of decays per unit
time follows an exponential law

66
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,582
to a very good approximation,

67
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:14,290
with a low background from accidental
coincidences between beam arrival and

68
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,590
the electron signal.

69
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,612
The slope of curve gives
the muon lifetime.

70
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:24,256
The MuLan Collaboration finds the value of

71
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:31,390
2,196,980.3 plus or minus 2.2 picoseconds.

72
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,985
This result dominate the global
average of the particle data group.

73
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:44,246
This gives a value of the Fermi constant
accurate to 0.6 parts per million.

74
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:48,915
The tau lepton lifetime is too short for
a direct of measurement.

75
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,725
We rather measure its path length L,
at high energies.

76
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:57,548
Tau leptons are produced in large
numbers in electron positron

77
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,920
annihilation into tau pairs.

78
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,730
At high energies, that is at
the square root of s equal to twice

79
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,635
the energy of the tau,
their lifetime in the laboratory frame

80
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,422
is extended by
the relativistic factor gamma.

81
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:17,894
Their mean part length L is
therefore longer by a factor

82
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:19,958
p over the mass of the tau.

83
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:24,130
With a lifetime of several
hundred femtoseconds,

84
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,950
the path length itself is hardly directly
observable, even at high energies.

85
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,027
At a tau energy of 50 GeV for example,

86
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,608
the average decay distance
is about 2.5 millimeters,

87
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:42,137
and thus completely
contained in the vacuum tube,

88
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:45,290
that contains the beam
of collider experiments.

89
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,665
One determines the decay point from the
vertex of decays into three charged particles.

90
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:58,878
As the tau decays in three
pions plus a neutrino.

91
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:04,000
The trajectories of the three pions
are measured with a tracking the detector,

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
which is typically a silicon detector,
directly outside the vacuum tube.

93
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,920
They are then extrapolated
back to their common origin,

94
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,542
which is the decay vertex
of the tau lepton.

95
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,800
The tau origin being known
from the beam position,

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,220
the decay length L is thus
the distance between the two points.

97
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,750
The decay length distribution
in logarithmic scale,

98
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,590
shows the expected exponential behavior,

99
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,381
but modified by
the experimental resolution,

100
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:40,160
which is significantly worse than for
direct time measurement.

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,350
The slope of the distribution
measures the average decay length,

102
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,970
which in turn gives the lifetime
as L/(gamma v).

103
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,364
The global average of tau lifetime
determined by the Particle

104
00:07:54,364 --> 00:08:02,040
Data Group is (290.3 ± 0.5) 10^-15s.

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,470
This figure is in excellent agreement
with the precision prediction, based

106
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:13,410
on the Fermi constant as determined by
the measured lifetime of the muon.

107
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,835
This show that the coupling
constants of the electron, muon and

108
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:21,290
tau to the W boson
are the same to within a few per mil.

109
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,238
In the next video,
we'll talk a little more about

110
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:31,816
the properties of the W+ and
W- bosons,

111
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,768
and in particular, about their masses.
