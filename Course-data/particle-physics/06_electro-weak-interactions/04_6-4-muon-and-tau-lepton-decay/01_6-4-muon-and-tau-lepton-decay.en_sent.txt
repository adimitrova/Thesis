[music] in the sixth module, we are discussing weak interaction.
and in this fourth video, we discuss a prototype process of charged weak interactions, the leptonic interaction of the w boson.
after following this video, you will know how to describe the decays of muon and tau leptons, in terms of a feynman diagram.
and how to discuss the properties of this interaction quantitatively.
here is the feynman diagram for muon decay.
the emission of the w- converts the muon into a muon neutrino.
the virtual w then decays into an electron - electron-antineutrino pair.
this way the lepton number weak isospin and other quantum numbers, are conserved.
in the diagram, we already converted the outgoing antineutrino into an incoming neutrino, by inverting its charge and four-momentum, kâ into -kâ.
in the amplitude, the w propagator contributes a factor of one over q^2 minus the mass squared of the w, which weakens the amplitude for q^s much smaller than the square of the mass of the w. at low momentum transfers, like for light particles decays where q^2 is smaller or equal to the square of the mass of the muon, that is, it is negligible, the propagator is constant and equal to the inverse of the square mass of the w. we can then treat this process in the  so-called fermi approximation.
by convention, one absorbs this residual of the w propagator with the square of the coupling constant g^2, to form the fermi constant g_f.
it takes the role of the fine structure constant for weak interactions.
in this approximation, valid at low momentum transfers, weak interactions can be described by a direct interaction between two current densities.
the transition currents corresponding to charged and weak interactions, are similar to the electromagnetic ones.
one denotes them in an imprecise manner, as charged currents cc.
analogously, the interaction of the z boson at low energy, that is q^2 much smaller than the square of the mass of the z, can be approximated by direct interaction of two neutral currents, nc.
the constant rho involves the weinberg angular theta_w, which measures the ratio between the coupling constants of the weak charged and neutral interactions.
the constant rho is equal to one with good precision.
this is due to the fact that in the standard theory of electroweak interaction, the masses of the vector bosons and the coupling constants are connected by the higgs mechanism, which we will discuss in video 6.11. high-precision experimental results verify this relationship.
the differencial muon decay rate, neglecting the mass of the electron, which is much smaller that the mass of the muon, is given here as a function of the energy eâ of the outgoing electron.
this energy can vary between zero and half the mass of the muon.
as this process is virtually the only decay channel, the total rate is obtained by integrating over eâ.
the measure of a lifetime of the muon is close to  2.2 10^-6 s. we thus find a fermi constant g_f of about 10^-5 inverse gev squared.
the factor m^5 comes in through the phase-space factor, which enters into the calculation of gamma.
therefore we find the same formula for other weak decays, especially for the tau decay.
it does on the other hand, not directly correspond to the total decay rate, because the tau has other important decay channels due its large mass.
so gamma for the specific decay is just a partial width, we must take into account the branching fraction in the numerator.
one of the most precise experiments that measure the muon lifetime, is mulan at the paul scherrer institute at villigen in switzerland.
a mu+ beam enters from the left, and is stopped in a target.
the scintillator ball surrounding the target registers the positrons from the decay, and measures their emission times.
the number of decays per unit time follows an exponential law to a very good approximation, with a low background from accidental coincidences between beam arrival and the electron signal.
the slope of curve gives the muon lifetime.
the mulan collaboration finds the value of 2,196,980.3 plus or minus 2.2 picoseconds.
this result dominate the global average of the particle data group.
this gives a value of the fermi constant accurate to 0.6 parts per million.
the tau lepton lifetime is too short for a direct of measurement.
we rather measure its path length l, at high energies.
tau leptons are produced in large numbers in electron positron annihilation into tau pairs.
at high energies, that is at the square root of s equal to twice the energy of the tau, their lifetime in the laboratory frame is extended by the relativistic factor gamma.
their mean part length l is therefore longer by a factor p over the mass of the tau.
with a lifetime of several hundred femtoseconds, the path length itself is hardly directly observable, even at high energies.
at a tau energy of 50 gev for example, the average decay distance is about 2.5 millimeters, and thus completely contained in the vacuum tube, that contains the beam of collider experiments.
one determines the decay point from the vertex of decays into three charged particles.
as the tau decays in three pions plus a neutrino.
the trajectories of the three pions are measured with a tracking the detector, which is typically a silicon detector, directly outside the vacuum tube.
they are then extrapolated back to their common origin, which is the decay vertex of the tau lepton.
the tau origin being known from the beam position, the decay length l is thus the distance between the two points.
the decay length distribution in logarithmic scale, shows the expected exponential behavior, but modified by the experimental resolution, which is significantly worse than for direct time measurement.
the slope of the distribution measures the average decay length, which in turn gives the lifetime as l/(gamma v).
the global average of tau lifetime determined by the particle data group is (290.3 â± 0.5) 10^-15s.
this figure is in excellent agreement with the precision prediction, based on the fermi constant as determined by the measured lifetime of the muon.
this show that the coupling constants of the electron, muon and tau to the w boson are the same to within a few per mil.
in the next video, we'll talk a little more about the properties of the w+ and w- bosons, and in particular, about their masses.
