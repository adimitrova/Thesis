in sixth module, 
we discussing weak interaction 
in this fourth video, 
we discuss a prototype process charged 
weak interactions, leptonic 
interaction w boson 
following this video, you will know 
to describe decays muon 
tau leptons, 
in terms a feynman diagram 
to discuss properties 
this interaction quantitatively 
here is feynman diagram 
muon decay 
emission w converts 
muon a muon neutrino 
virtual w decays 
an electron electronantineutrino pair 
this way lepton number 
weak isospin 
quantum numbers, conserved 
in diagram, we already converted 
outgoing antineutrino an incoming 
neutrino, inverting charge 
fourmomentum, k k 
in amplitude, w propagator 
contributes a factor one q 
minus mass squared w, 
weakens amplitude 
qs much smaller 
square mass w 
low momentum transfers, like 
light particles decays 
q is smaller 
equal to square mass 
muon, that is, is negligible, 
propagator is constant equal to 
inverse square mass w 
we treat this process in 
socalled fermi approximation 
convention, one absorbs this 
residual w propagator 
square coupling constant 
g, to form fermi constant gf 
takes role fine structure 
constant weak interactions 
in this approximation, valid low 
momentum transfers, weak interactions 
described a direct interaction 
between two current densities 
transition currents corresponding 
to charged weak interactions, 
similar to electromagnetic ones 
one denotes in an imprecise manner, 
charged currents cc 
analogously, interaction 
z boson low energy, 
that is q much smaller 
square mass z, 
approximated direct interaction 
two neutral currents, nc 
constant rho involves weinberg 
angular thetaw, measures 
ratio between coupling constants 
weak charged neutral interactions 
constant rho is equal 
to one good precision 
this is due to fact that in 
standard theory electroweak 
interaction, masses vector 
bosons coupling constants 
connected higgs mechanism, 
we will discuss in video 
highprecision experimental 
results verify this relationship 
differencial muon decay rate, 
neglecting mass electron, 
is much smaller that 
mass muon, 
is given here a function energy 
e outgoing electron 
this energy vary between zero 
half mass muon 
this process is virtually 
decay channel, 
total rate is obtained 
integrating e 
measure a lifetime 
muon is close to 

we thus find a fermi constant gf 
inverse gev squared 
factor m comes in 
phasespace factor, 
enters calculation gamma 
therefore we find formula 
weak decays, 
especially tau decay 
hand, directly 
correspond to total decay rate, 
tau important 
decay channels due large mass 
so gamma specific 
decay is a partial width, 
we must take account 
branching fraction in numerator 
one precise experiments 
that measure muon lifetime, 
is mulan paul scherrer 
institute villigen in switzerland 
a mu beam enters left, 
is stopped in a target 
scintillator ball surrounding target 
registers positrons decay, 
measures emission times 
number decays per unit 
time follows an exponential law 
to a good approximation, 
a low background accidental 
coincidences between beam arrival 
electron signal 
slope curve gives 
muon lifetime 
mulan collaboration finds value 
,, plus minus picoseconds 
this result dominate global 
average particle data group 
this gives a value fermi constant 
accurate to parts per million 
tau lepton lifetime is short 
a direct measurement 
we rather measure path length l, 
high energies 
tau leptons produced in large 
numbers in electron positron 
annihilation tau pairs 
high energies, that is 
square root equal to twice 
energy tau, 
lifetime in laboratory frame 
is extended 
relativistic factor gamma 
mean part length l is 
therefore longer a factor 
p mass tau 
a lifetime several 
hundred femtoseconds, 
path length is hardly directly 
observable, even high energies 
a tau energy gev example, 
average decay distance 
is millimeters, 
thus completely 
contained in vacuum tube, 
that contains beam 
collider experiments 
one determines decay point 
vertex decays three charged particles 
tau decays in three 
pions plus a neutrino 
trajectories three pions 
measured a tracking detector, 
is typically a silicon detector, 
directly outside vacuum tube 
extrapolated 
back to common origin, 
is decay vertex 
tau lepton 
tau origin known 
beam position, 
decay length l is thus 
distance between two points 
decay length distribution 
in logarithmic scale, 
shows expected exponential behavior, 
modified 
experimental resolution, 
is significantly worse 
direct time measurement 
slope distribution 
measures average decay length, 
in turn gives lifetime 
lgamma v 
global average tau lifetime 
determined particle 
data group is 
this figure is in excellent agreement 
precision prediction, based 
fermi constant determined 
measured lifetime muon 
this show that coupling

tau to w boson 
to within a few per mil 
in next video, 
well talk a little
