2
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:15,100
In this sixth module,
we are discussing weak interactions.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,909
In this second video, we introduce
the operations of charge conjugation,

4
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:22,785
parity, and time reversal.

5
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:27,335
After following this video, you will know
discrete transformations of space time,

6
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:32,065
which are parity and time reversal,
the charge conjugation transformation,

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:37,505
which reverses all charges, and
the behavior of forces and matter

8
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:43,550
under these transformations.
The reversals of space and

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,890
time directions are discrete
transformations of space-time coordinates.

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,240
For the space coordinates,

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,950
the transformation is also
called the parity, P.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,710
Both transformations can be applied
as operators to a quantum state

13
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,246
such as a particle.

14
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:06,181
These operators are unitary,
because a double application

15
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,570
to the initial state
reproduce the original state.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,917
Therefore the eigenvalues of
the two operators are plus or

17
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:20,570
minus 1 if they are applied to
eigenstates of parity or time reversal.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,200
However, there are many wave functions
which are not eigenstates of parity.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,080
For example, a function phi
equal to cos x + sin x

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,160
becomes under the application
of parity cos x - sin x,

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,370
which is neither +phi nor -phi.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,900
Eigenstates of P can be
classified like in this table.

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,350
Scalar wave functions describe the spin
zero particles with positive parity.

24
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,270
Pseudoscalar ones describe spin
zero particles with parity minus.

25
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,800
Vector and axial vector wave
functions describe the spin

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,140
one particles with parity negative and
positive respectively.

27
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,380
Parity is a multiplicative quantum number,
so the total parity of a system

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,290
in its ground state is the product of
the individual parities of its components.

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,262
If there is an angular momentum
between the components,

30
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:28,716
characterized by am l-type
quantum number,

31
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:33,741
it must be taken into account by
a factor (-1)^l.

32
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:38,395
Parity is conserved in interaction due to
electromagnetic and strong forces, but

33
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:40,470
not in weak interactions.

34
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,656
Conservation means that if a system is
in an eigenstate before the reaction,

35
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:51,340
it will be in an eigenstate with
the same eigenvalue after the reaction.

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,390
For bound states, the total angular
momentum, J=l + s,

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,730
comes in, multiplying the intrinsic
parity of the components.

38
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,410
Consequently, the notation J^P is
used to characterize particles.

39
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,770
You find it in the PDG tables for
each particle.

40
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,460
Electromagnetic transitions in bound
states, as the hydrogen atom for

41
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,470
example, require that ∆l ± 1.

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,590
So the parity of the photon
must be -1.

43
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,260
The photon is thus indeed a vector
particle, as we noted in module 4.

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,950
Hadrons are parity eigenstates,
thus their parity eigenvalues can be

45
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,680
used to characterize a particle, just like
spin, electric charge or baryon number.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,430
The parity of fermions is
opposite to that of antifermions.

47
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,970
By convention, parities are arbitrarily
fixed to +1 for leptons and quarks,

48
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,100
and antiquarks and antileptions,
therefore, have parity -1.

49
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,249
For bosons, the parity is the same for
particles and antiparticles.

50
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,430
The photon parity,
as we already said, is -1.

51
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,280
Baryons which contain three quarks
without a relative quantum angular

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,740
momentum, such as the proton and neutron,
have a parity (+1)^3,

53
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,940
so, finally, parity +1.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,800
That is to say that J^P is (1/2)^+.

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,698
The lightest mesons,
such as pions as well as light kaons,

56
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,934
contain quark and
antiquark with anti parallel spins.

57
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:43,040
They have parity (+1)(-1), so -1,

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,250
and they are called pseudoscalar mesons.

59
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,936
The states with the same quark
contents but parallels spins,

60
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:59,690
like the mesons rho, K^*, omega,
and Phi are called vector mesons.

61
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,420
They have J^P equal to 1^-.

62
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,680
But parity is not just
a theoretical concept,

63
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,280
it has a measurable effect whenever it
corresponds to a conserved observable.

64
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,700
Let us look at the dominant decay of
the π^0, which goes into photons.

65
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,380
The study of this process
has allowed to conclude that

66
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,292
π^0 is a pseudoscalar boson
with J^P = 0^-.

67
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:36,116
Its decay products are two photons,
vector boson of J^P = 1^-.

68
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:40,080
We project spins on the
only natural axis of the system,

69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,020
given by the direction of the two
photons in the rest frame of the π^0.

70
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,080
Conservation of angular momentum requires

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,340
one of the two configurations sketched
here, or a combination of both.

72
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,550
The first configuration has two photons in
a right circular polarization state.

73
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,168
The second has the left polarized photons.

74
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:07,752
Under parity, the momentum of the two
photons change sign but their spin,

75
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:10,179
being pseudovectors, do not change.

76
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:15,011
So the parity operation changes
the first configuration

77
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:18,309
into the second one, and vice versa.

78
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,610
The photon wave function is characterized
by its polarization vector epsilon,

79
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,430
which points in the direction
of the electric field, and for

80
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,980
real photons is normal to
the direction of motion.

81
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,060
As parity is conserved in decay process,

82
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,020
this requires that the total wave function
psi be an eigenstate of parity.

83
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,506
Up to a normalization constant,
the two possibilities correspond to

84
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,780
the wave function psi_1 and
psi_2, given here.

85
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,370
The first is proportional to a scalar,
so it has parity +1.

86
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,780
The angle phi between the two polarization
planes will be preferentially zero,

87
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,740
with an intensity distribution
proportional to the square of cosine phi.

88
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,697
The second is proportional to the product
between a pseudovector and a vector.

89
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:15,460
So it has parity -1.

90
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,942
The angle phi between the polarization
planes of the two photons will be

91
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,680
preferentially 90 degrees.

92
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,270
Experimentally, it is found that
they are indeed orthogonal.

93
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,861
The party of the π^0
is therefore -1.

94
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:35,797
The charge conjugation operator,
indicated by C,

95
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:42,190
is an example of a transformation of
the field itself and not of coordinates.

96
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,090
It transforms the wave
function of a particle,

97
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,007
phi_P, into the wave function
of its antiparticle, phi_pbar.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,976
The operation therefore changes the sign
of electric charge, color, baryon, and

99
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,520
lepton number,

100
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,810
in short, all the quantum
numbers of the charge type.

101
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,641
Thus the operator C applied to
a fermion gives an antifermion,

102
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:11,601
with all charges opposite,
with the same mass, the same spin,

103
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,400
and the same momentum.

104
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,010
Again electromagnetic and strong
interactions conserve charge conjugation.

105
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,330
That is to say that this interactions have

106
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,335
the same intensity for
particles and anti-particles.

107
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:31,311
Weak interactions on the contrary
violate C, so

108
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:35,700
they distinguish between the particles and
the anti-particles.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,699
Particles which do not have any
charge can be eigenstates of C.

110
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,401
They are their own anti-particles.

111
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:49,830
The photon and the Z boson are examples.

112
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,619
The pseudoscalar meson π^0,
which is also its own anti-particle,

113
00:08:55,619 --> 00:09:01,170
has C phi_pi = phi_pi,
with eigenvalue C = +1.

114
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,700
Since the photon is
generated by moving charges,

115
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,570
which change sign of
the electric charge under C,

116
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,230
C A_µ = -A_µ.

117
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,180
So charge conjugation is another
multiplicative quantum number.

118
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,616
A system of n photons will have
a C equal to (-1)^n.

119
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:30,151
For example, π^0 decay into two
photons respects the conservation of C,

120
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,966
but π^0 decay into
three photons is forbidden.

121
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:38,163
Indeed, the branching
ratio of this decay is

122
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:43,141
measured to be less than
3.1 10^-8.

123
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:47,647
Time reversal operation, indicated by T,

124
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:52,517
transforms the coordinate for
four-vector x, so (t,x,y,z)

125
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:58,280
into x’ = (-t,x,y,z). 

126
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,370
When applied to a field, T also turns
them into their complex conjugate, and

127
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,568
this is necessary because of the
transformation of the equation of motion.

128
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:13,018
Except for real boson fields,
there are no eigenstates of T alone.

129
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:15,980
So no conserved quantum number associated.

130
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,150
The importance of T is rather in combination
with the other discrete transformations,

131
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,510
parity and charge conservation.

132
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,265
One can easily understand that all
the local fields theories must be invariant

133
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:36,320
under the joint action of CPT,
transforming a process into itself.

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,790
We will see what follows
that weak interaction

135
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,180
violated to a maximum extent
the symmetry C and P, and

136
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,360
even the combined operation CP,
which transforms right handed fermions

137
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,410
into a left hand antifermions,
is not respected by weak interactions.

138
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,990
This introduces a small difference
between a reaction and its reverse.

139
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,760
It gives an objective direction to time.

140
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,980
We will introduce weak
interactions in the next video.

141
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,959
