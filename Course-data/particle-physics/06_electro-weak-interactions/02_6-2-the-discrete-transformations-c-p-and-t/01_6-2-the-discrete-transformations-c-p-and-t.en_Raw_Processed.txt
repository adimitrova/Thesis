in this sixth module, 
we discussing weak interactions 
in this second video, we introduce 
operations charge conjugation, 
parity, time reversal 
following this video, you will know 
discrete transformations space time, 
parity time reversal, 
charge conjugation transformation, 
reverses charges, 
behavior forces matter 
transformations 
reversals space 
time directions discrete 
transformations spacetime coordinates 
space coordinates, 
transformation is also 
called parity, p 
transformations applied 
operators to a quantum state 
a particle 
operators unitary, 
a double application 
to initial state 
reproduce original state 
therefore eigenvalues 
two operators plus 
minus if applied to 
eigenstates parity time reversal 
however, there many wave functions 
eigenstates parity 
example, a function phi 
equal to cos x sin x 
becomes application 
parity cos x sin x, 
is neither phi phi 
eigenstates p 
classified like in this table 
scalar wave functions describe spin 
zero particles positive parity 
pseudoscalar ones describe spin 
zero particles parity minus 
vector axial vector wave 
functions describe spin 
one particles parity negative 
positive respectively 
parity is a multiplicative quantum number, 
so total parity a system 
in ground state is product 
individual parities components 
if there is an angular momentum 
between components, 
characterized ltype 
quantum number, 
must taken account 
a factor l 
parity is conserved in interaction due to 
electromagnetic strong forces, 
in weak interactions 
conservation means that if a system is 
in an eigenstate reaction, 
will in an eigenstate 
eigenvalue reaction 
bound states, total angular 
momentum, jl s, 
comes in, multiplying intrinsic 
parity components 
consequently, notation jp is 
used to characterize particles 
you find in pdg tables 
particle 
electromagnetic transitions in bound 
states, hydrogen atom 
example, require that l 
so parity photon 
must 
photon is thus indeed a vector 
particle, we noted in module 
hadrons parity eigenstates, 
thus parity eigenvalues 
used to characterize a particle, like 
spin, electric charge baryon number 
parity fermions is 
opposite to that antifermions 
convention, parities arbitrarily 
fixed to leptons quarks, 
antiquarks antileptions, 
therefore, parity 
bosons, parity is 
particles antiparticles 
photon parity, 
we already said, is 
baryons contain three quarks 
without a relative quantum angular 
momentum, proton neutron, 
a parity , 
so, finally, parity 
that is to say that jp is 
lightest mesons, 
pions well light kaons, 
contain quark 
antiquark anti parallel spins 
parity , so , 
called pseudoscalar mesons 
states quark 
contents parallels spins, 
like mesons rho, k, omega, 
phi called vector mesons 
jp equal to 
parity is 
a theoretical concept, 
a measurable effect whenever 
corresponds to a conserved observable 
let us look dominant decay 
, goes photons 
study this process 
allowed to conclude that 
is a pseudoscalar boson 
jp 
decay products two photons, 
vector boson jp 
we project spins 
natural axis system, 
given direction two 
photons in rest frame 
conservation angular momentum requires 
one two configurations sketched 
here, a combination 
first configuration two photons in 
a right circular polarization state 
second left polarized photons 
parity, momentum two 
photons change sign spin, 
pseudovectors, change 
so parity operation changes 
first configuration 
second one, vice versa 
photon wave function is characterized 
polarization vector epsilon, 
points in direction 
electric field, 
real photons is normal to 
direction motion 
parity is conserved in decay process, 
this requires that total wave function 
psi an eigenstate parity 
to a normalization constant, 
two possibilities correspond to 
wave function psi 
psi, given here 
first is proportional to a scalar, 
so parity 
angle phi between two polarization 
planes will preferentially zero, 
an intensity distribution 
proportional to square cosine phi 
second is proportional to product 
between a pseudovector a vector 
so parity 
angle phi between polarization 
planes two photons will 
preferentially degrees 
experimentally, is found that 
indeed orthogonal 
party 
is therefore 
charge conjugation operator, 
indicated c, 
is an example a transformation 
field coordinates 
transforms wave 
function a particle, 
phip, wave function 
antiparticle, phipbar 
operation therefore changes sign 
electric charge, color, baryon, 
lepton number, 
in short, quantum 
numbers charge type 
thus operator c applied to 
a fermion gives an antifermion, 
charges opposite, 
mass, spin, 
momentum 
electromagnetic strong 
interactions conserve charge conjugation 
that is to say that this interactions 
intensity 
particles antiparticles 
weak interactions contrary 
violate c, so 
distinguish between particles 
antiparticles 
particles 
charge eigenstates c 
antiparticles 
photon z boson examples 
pseudoscalar meson , 
is also antiparticle, 
c phipi phipi, 
eigenvalue c 
since photon is 
generated moving charges, 
change sign 
electric charge c, 
c a a 
so charge conjugation is another 
multiplicative quantum number 
a system n photons will 
a c equal to n 
example, decay two 
photons respects conservation c, 
decay 
three photons is forbidden 
indeed, branching 
ratio this decay is 
measured to less 
time reversal operation, indicated t, 
transforms coordinate 
fourvector x, so t,x,y,z 
x t,x,y,z 
applied to a field, also turns 
complex conjugate, 
this is necessary 
transformation equation motion 
except real boson fields, 
there eigenstates alone 
so conserved quantum number associated 
importance is rather in combination 
discrete transformations, 
parity charge conservation 
one easily understand that 
local fields theories must invariant 
joint action cpt, 
transforming a process 
we will see follows 
that weak interaction 
violated to a maximum extent 
symmetry c p, 
even combined operation cp, 
transforms right handed fermions 
a left hand antifermions, 
is respected weak interactions 
this introduces a small difference 
between a reaction reverse 
gives an objective direction to time 
we will introduce weak 
interactions in next video
