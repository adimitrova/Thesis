2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,951
In the sixth module, we are discussing
weak interactions, and in this tenth video,

3
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:20,840
we talk about oscillation between
different neutrino flavors.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,660
After following this video, you will know
how to describe the quantum mechanism of

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,307
oscillation between neutrinos
of different generations and

6
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:33,320
the key methods used to
detect such oscillations.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,140
You may have wondered why the particles
nu_L, nu_M, and nu_H, which were

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,250
introduced in module 1, do not appear
in reactions via the weak force.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,698
There reason is just that, as for
quarks, the neutrinos which interact

10
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:57,660
with the W are superposition
of these real particles.

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,950
Consequently, a phenomenon
analogous to quark oscillations

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,096
happens in the family of neutrinos.

13
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:09,029
Vacuum oscillations between
different neutrino flavors

14
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:12,650
can occur if neutrinos have
even zero mass and

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,696
if their mass is different
from generation to generation.

16
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:20,180
And these two conditions are indeed met.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Let us first consider two
flavors of neutrinos nu_mu and

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,695
nu_tau for
example, involved in weak interaction.

19
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:36,356
And two mass eigenstates, two real particles, nu_M and

20
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:39,723
nu_H with masses m_M and m_H.

21
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:46,860
The relation between the two classes
are unitary rotations in flavor space.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,062
The angle theta_MH is the equivalent of
the Cabibbo angle in

23
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:57,720
the quark sector which we have
introduced in video 6.7.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,960
The two particles nu_M and
nu_H propagate in the z direction,

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,277
for example, with different wave functions
because of their different masses.

26
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:13,679
The second equation is valid in
the ultra relativistic approximation,

27
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:18,190
where p is equal to E-m^2/2E
and t is equal to z.

28
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,701
Now take a nu_mu beam at
t = 0 created for

29
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:29,984
instance by π+ -> µ+ nu_mu.

30
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:34,438
At a later time t, so
at a distance z from its origin,

31
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:38,000
this beam will be composed differently.

32
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:45,450
The probability to find a nu_tau in
this beam will therefore not be 0.

33
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,462
The factor 1.27 takes into
account the constants

34
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:55,135
as well as the conversion
of units such that we can put

35
00:02:55,135 --> 00:03:00,058
delta m^2 which is equal
to (m_H^2 - m_M^2) 

36
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:07,362
in eV^2, E^2 in GeV^2
and z in km.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,300
The two factors in the equation
correspond to the amplitude and

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,350
phase of an oscillation.

39
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,812
By choosing a distance z, which is
of the same order of magnitude as

40
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,755
delta m^2/4E,

41
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:28,880
one can thus make a part of the nu_mu
disappear and convert them into a nu_tau.

42
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,840
This nu_mu disappearance
was first observed for

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
the so-called atmospheric neutrinos.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,782
Cosmic rays incident on
the Earth atmosphere are mostly protons.

45
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:46,937
The hadron shower they cause in the atmosphere
is dominated by pions.

46
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:53,300
In their decay, pions produce nu_mu and
nu_e in a relative proportion of 2:1.

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,836
Thus there ought to be twice as many nu_mu
and anti-nu_mu in the atmospheric showers

48
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:02,931
than nu_e and anti-nu _e.

49
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,642
If on the other hand
neutrinos undergo oscillation,

50
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:10,030
the ratio of both neutrino flavors 
will vary with distance.

51
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,166
Fortunately, Earth
provides the means to vary the distance

52
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:20,816
between the source and
the target without moving the experiment.

53
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:26,085
Neutrinos from the nadir
travel a distance

54
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:34,129
larger by the Earth diameter
compared to those from the zenith.

55
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,161
As the primary flux of cosmic protons
is homogeneous and isotropic and

56
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:42,121
since low energy neutrinos hardly
interact with the terrestrial matter,

57
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:44,569
any change in the ratio
of nu_mu to nu_e

58
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,170
with the zenith angle is
an indication of oscillation.

59
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,750
It is evident from the unitarity
of the operation that for

60
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,800
the probability of survival, where
the nu_mu which stays a nu_mu,

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,507
is equal to one minus
the probability of oscillation.

62
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:06,580
Experimentally one averages
over the unknown neutrino energy at

63
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,020
a known propagation distance.

64
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,450
The oscillation curves for different
energies, shown here by different colors,

65
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,565
are thus averaged over
the spectrum of neutrinos.

66
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:23,765
This gives the black curve as a function
of distance indicated on the top scale,

67
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:28,025
or as a function of the angle of
incidence indicated on the bottom.

68
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:34,115
The neutrino flux is measured and
their flavor identified

69
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:38,770
by measuring the reaction rate
of charged current interactions,

70
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,240
which produced either a muon or
an electron in the final state.

71
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,330
With a known cross section
the reaction rate is proportional

72
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,850
to the incident neutrino flux.

73
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,860
One finds experimentally that the observed
flux ratio is compatible with

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,140
the calculated oscillation probability.

75
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,720
Please note that the scale of length over
energy in this plot is the opposite of

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,810
the one we have shown in
the slide just before.

77
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,960
The observed oscillation
amplitude is quite large,

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,909
and therefore corresponds to
an angle theta_MH equal to 

79
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,742
45 ± 13 degrees.

80
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:24,582
The difference of square masses is of
the order of 3 10^-3 eV

81
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:29,110
and thus extremely small.

82
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,278
Furthermore it is more likely that the
oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos happens

83
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:40,400
between the second and third generation
that is between nu_mu and mu_tau.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,292
In general the relationship
between the states participating

85
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:50,087
in leptonic weak interactions,
nu_e, nu_mu and nu_tau,

86
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:54,791
and eigenstates of
the mass operator, nu_L, nu_M, and

87
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:59,679
nu_H is described by a unitary
matrix of 3x3 elements,

88
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:05,066
analogous to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix for hadronic currents.

89
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,282
For leptons it is called the Pontecorvo-
Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix.

90
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:14,032
Like the matrix for quarks,
the one for leptons may contain

91
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:19,101
a nontrivial phase that would violate 
CP symmetry if it existed.

92
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:23,299
Future neutrino experiments
will show its existence or not.

93
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,862
Different types of neutrino
oscillations have been observed to date, and

94
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:33,010
an inexhaustive list is the following.

95
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,188
The disappearance of atmospheric nu_mu,

96
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:40,365
disappearance of the nu_mu
produced by accelerators,

97
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:46,110
appearance of nu_tau and nu_e in 
a nu_mu beam produced at accelerators.

98
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,596
Disappearance of anti-nu_e which are 
abundantly reproduced in nuclear power plants.

99
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,870
For each of these measurements we give you
a resource of information that you can

100
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,560
use to find more details.

101
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,300
As an example we show
here the interaction of

102
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,290
a nu_tau appearing in a nu_mu beam
produced at CERN and observed

103
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,190
by the OPERA detector situated in the Gran
Sasso underground laboratory in Italy.

104
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,200
The neutrino interactions are observed
using photographic emulsion,

105
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,180
which are then developed.

106
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,610
The dE/dx of charged
particles thus becomes visible.

107
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,210
This animation shows an enlargement around
the vertex of the neutrino interaction.

108
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,422
The reconstruction shows in the final
state a charged tau lepton

109
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:44,710
in red which decays into π- in cyan and
a π0, which is invisible.

110
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,430
The kink between the parent and

111
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,613
other tracks is a clear
signal of a tau lepton decay.

112
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:56,108
The photons from the π0 decay
are shown in yellow and

113
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,600
they point to the decay vertex.

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,500
This topology is a clear signature
of a nu_tau interaction

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,099
which had appeared in the nu_mu
beam by flavor oscillation.

116
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:12,486
Neutrino oscillation are a very lively
research sector in the United States,

117
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,240
Europe, and Asia.

118
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,137
And we can expect spectacular results
by experiments which are in progress

119
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,490
and under construction.

120
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,175
In the next video we discuss the fact
that mass is not an intrinsic property

121
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:32,689
of particles, but it is dynamically 
generated by the Higgs mechanism.
