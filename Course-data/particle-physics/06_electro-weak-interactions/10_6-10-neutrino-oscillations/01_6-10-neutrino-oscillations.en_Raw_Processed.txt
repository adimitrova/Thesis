in sixth module, we discussing 
weak interactions, in this tenth video, 
we talk oscillation between 
different neutrino flavors 
following this video, you will know 
to describe quantum mechanism 
oscillation between neutrinos 
different generations 
key methods used to 
detect oscillations 
you may wondered particles 
nul, num, nuh, 
introduced in module , appear 
in reactions via weak force 
there reason is that, 
quarks, neutrinos interact 
w superposition 
real particles 
consequently, a phenomenon 
analogous to quark oscillations 
happens in family neutrinos 
vacuum oscillations between 
different neutrino flavors 
occur if neutrinos 
even zero mass 
if mass is different 
generation to generation 
two conditions indeed met 
let us first consider two 
flavors neutrinos numu 
nutau 
example, involved in weak interaction 
two mass eigenstates, two real particles, num 
nuh masses mm mh 
relation between two classes 
unitary rotations in flavor space 
angle thetamh is equivalent 
cabibbo angle in 
quark sector we 
introduced in video 
two particles num 
nuh propagate in z direction, 
example, different wave functions 
different masses 
second equation is valid in 
ultra relativistic approximation, 
p is equal to eme 
is equal to z 
take a numu beam 
created 
instance numu 
a later time t, so 
a distance z origin, 
this beam will composed differently 
probability to find a nutau in 
this beam will therefore 
factor takes 
account constants 
well conversion 
units that we put 
delta m is equal 
to mh mm 
in ev, e in gev 
z in km 
two factors in equation 
correspond to amplitude 
phase an oscillation 
choosing a distance z, is 
order magnitude 
delta me, 
one thus make a part numu 
disappear convert a nutau 
this numu disappearance 
first observed 
socalled atmospheric neutrinos 
cosmic rays incident 
earth atmosphere mostly protons 
hadron shower cause in atmosphere 
is dominated pions 
in decay, pions produce numu 
nue in a relative proportion 
thus there ought to twice many numu 
antinumu in atmospheric showers 
nue antinu e 
if hand 
neutrinos undergo oscillation, 
ratio neutrino flavors 
will vary distance 
fortunately, earth 
provides means to vary distance 
between source 
target without moving experiment 
neutrinos nadir 
travel a distance 
larger earth diameter 
compared to zenith 
primary flux cosmic protons 
is homogeneous isotropic 
since low energy neutrinos hardly 
interact terrestrial matter, 
change in ratio 
numu to nue 
zenith angle is 
an indication oscillation 
is evident unitarity 
operation that 
probability survival, 
numu stays a numu, 
is equal to one minus 
probability oscillation 
experimentally one averages 
unknown neutrino energy 
a known propagation distance 
oscillation curves different 
energies, shown here different colors, 
thus averaged 
spectrum neutrinos 
this gives black curve a function 
distance indicated top scale, 
a function angle 
incidence indicated bottom 
neutrino flux is measured 
flavor identified 
measuring reaction rate 
charged current interactions, 
produced either a muon 
an electron in final state 
a known cross section 
reaction rate is proportional 
to incident neutrino flux 
one finds experimentally that observed 
flux ratio is compatible 
calculated oscillation probability 
please note that scale length 
energy in this plot is opposite 
one we shown in 
slide 
observed oscillation 
amplitude is quite large, 
therefore corresponds to 
an angle thetamh equal to 
degrees 
difference square masses is 
order ev 
thus extremely small 
furthermore is likely that 
oscillation atmospheric neutrinos happens 
between second third generation 
that is between numu mutau 
in general relationship 
between states participating 
in leptonic weak interactions, 
nue, numu nutau, 
eigenstates 
mass operator, nul, num, 
nuh is described a unitary 
matrix x elements, 
analogous to cabibbokobayashimaskawa 
matrix hadronic currents 
leptons is called pontecorvo 
makinakagawasakata matrix 
like matrix quarks, 
one leptons may contain 
a nontrivial phase that would violate 
cp symmetry if existed 
future neutrino experiments 
will show existence 
different types neutrino 
oscillations observed to date, 
an inexhaustive list is following 
disappearance atmospheric numu, 
disappearance numu 
produced accelerators, 
appearance nutau nue in 
a numu beam produced accelerators 
disappearance antinue 
abundantly reproduced in nuclear power plants 
measurements we give you 
a resource information that you 
use to find details 
an example we show 
here interaction

sasso underground laboratory in italy
