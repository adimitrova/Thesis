we lots really good building 
blocks we havent yet put together 
cause we dont fully know fit 
together, we lots cool 
things 
we controllability, that tells us 
whether possible to control 
system, if we access to 
state 
way we that is using state 
feedback 
we this notion observability, 
tells us whether is 
possible to, to figure state 
output, way we that is 
building observers we this 
tool that seems remarkably strong 
is poleplacement basically allows 
us to place closed loop eigen values 
ever we want 
so make equal to desired eigen 
values big question is 
we put everything together 
answer is known separation 
principle 
in a nut shell, separation 
principle, way, is quite 
wonderful tells us that we actually 
decouple observer design control 
design meaning we 
actually control system if we 
x, even though we dont 
we get estimate x 
using an observer structure 
so this is topic todays lecture 
really is reason 
able to effectively control linear 
systems 
so, heres game plan 
now, i x dot is ax bu 
y is cx 
so this is a standard linear time 
variance system 
im going to assume that this system 
is completely controllable 
completely observable 
if then, to completely frank, 
toast 
that means, we need to go buy 
new sensors, is fancy speak get 
a new c matrix 
we need to buy actuators 
means get a better b matrix 
so lets assume that we complete 
controllability complete 
observability 
well, st step in game plan is 
lets ignore fact that we dont 
x 
so im going to design state feedback 
controller if i x, meaning im 
going to pick ukx, means that i 
get closed loop, closed loop 
dynamics to this 
now, this is i designed i 
favorite pole placement tool to 
this 
now, in reality, i dont that 
reality is i u is kx hat, 
hat is estimated state 
so thats i actually even 
though thats i designed 
step two, course, is im going to 
estimate x using, using an in order to 
get this x hat to make 
pleasant 
big thing that we note is 
that previously we didnt a u term 
in observer dynamics 
we a u term that we need to 
take account turns that 
simple to that 
i built predicter predicter 
part 
contains ax hat a bu term, 
a predictor is a copy 
dynamics 
i corrector part 
is this error between actual output 
ouput would if i 
x hat instead x 
well, this structure gives 
aerodynamics here 
so we is i pick l so that 
error, estimation error is stabilized 
thats error is actual 
state minus estimated state 
so this is game plan 
now, lets see if this game plan is 
good 
a fact 
good right 
otherwise im wasting everyones time 
slides, lets make sure that 
indeed is worth while 
we want, this system to we 
want to drive x to zero, 
stabilizing it, we want to drive e to 
zero, we want estimate to 
good 
so, i need to do, is analyze 
joint dynamics together 
so x dot, is axbu, u is, if you 
remember, u k, x, xhat, 
is i get x dynamics to look like 
this 
while e dynamics, thats matrenary 
dynamics, is always 
okay, lets simplify this a little bit 
so, i know that error is x minus x 
hat 
so i replace this x hat x minus 
error 
so i get dynamics 
pushups to a minus bkx 
plus bk 
e 
so i something that involves x 
e here invovles e 
so i actually write everything in 
a joint way 
x dot e dot is this large matrix 
thats an nxn a nxnx e 
mow, strategy, joint strategy 
works if if this new joint 
system is an asymptotically stable 
system 
means that we need to check 
eigenvalues this new system matrix 
now, here is separation 
principle comes play 
this is dynamics 
now, this matrix here is a rather special 
matrix 
triangular 
a block there, a block 
there a block there 
triangular matrices, block 
triangular matrices 
may upper lower triangular 
a particularly nice structure 
so this is an upper triangle blockmatrix 
eigenvalues given 
diagonal blocks 
means that eiganvalues to this 
whole matrix eiganvalues to this 
matrix eiganvalues to this 
matrix 
another way writing is that 
characteristic equation is 
characteristic equation to first 
block here 
times characteristic equation to 
second block here 
that this means is that 
eigenvalues given values 
diagonal blocks 
here is wonderful part 
if we havent stupid in we 
design, this thing 
stabalized, we cold placement 
to make sure that real part 
diagonals is strictly negative 
this part we made sure is also well 
behaved we designed 
observer in a way that real part 
eigenvalue is completely negative 
means that we havent messed 
anything 
everything works 
that means is 
control design people, we design 
controllers if we state 
we rely clever sensing people 
to estimate state us 
thanks to separation principal 
everything works 
ones that we keep in mind is that 
we still this term here, this 
term that basically tells you something 
happens to transients 
awhile 
this term doesnt really matter 
everything works, so we ready to 
state separation principle 
separation principle tells us that we 
in fact design controllers if we 
x 
then, we design observers 
independent control actions, 
is, adding 
a bu in observer dynamic, so 
control actions actually 
canceled 
in words, control observer 
designs completely separated 
so, if you put everything together, in a 
final glorious block diagram 
this is world looks like 
we system 
this is physics 
this is a system 
now, we modeled using a b c 
matrices, comes this 
thing is y, meaning measurements 
we push this system is u, 
control action 
now, taking u, sorry, taking 
y feeding observer 
so observer is, axhat bu 
lycxhat and, one thing to note, 
is that we need both, y u to feed 
observer 
now, observer comes xhat, 
meaning, estimate system 
is actually 
now, we use xhat to feed back, to 
get are, u 
beautiful thing here is that, 
two blocks together, 
constitute controller 
so two blocks whats done 
in software this, is physics 
world 
so this plant, theres nothing we 
that controller consists 
two pieces 
one piece that, estimates state 
another piece that computes control 
actiong 
so we everything we need to 
effective control design well 
in next lecture, is 
final lecture, lecture this module is 
that well actually deploy 
in fact, going to see in 
action a humanoid robot 
simultaneous control state 
estimation
