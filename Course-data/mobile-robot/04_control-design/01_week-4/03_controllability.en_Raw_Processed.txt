so, in previous lecture, we saw that 
there something fishy play here, 
sometimes we poleplacement 
sometimes we cannot 
we really here is, a 
question b matrix 
is b matrix rich enough, so that we 
make system whatever we want 
to remember, that b 
matrix, really describes actuators we 
so, if cheap we dont buy 
actuators, i mean theres nothing we 
do, course, we cannot affect 
system 
so, choice b matrix meaning 
actuators we buy will matter whether 
we enough control authority 
revolves around concept 
controlability 
that is topic this lecture 
in order to sneak 
controlability, im going to start a 
rather modest example 
lets a discretetime system, we 
seen mainly continuous times systems 
lets start discretetime system 
here starting a time zero origin 

so, i would like to is take this 
system in n steps, n is 
dimension of, state, 
im going to drive to a target state, 
x 
so basically, heres i want to do, i 
want to start origin 
in n steps sound flow around 
until i get to i would like to 
question one ask is, 
i that is possible there 
exist a u well, lets figure 

first thing i is i pick view 
time x, 
axbu 
well, x equal to , so this whole 
thing is simply equal to b times u 
well x, thats a times x plus b times 
u well, x is bu, right, so whole 
thing becomes abubu 
x, well if i plug things in, i get 
abuabubu 
in fact, if i keep going to xn, i get a 
n bu, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
right 
so, we seem to a formula, really, 

we end 
and, in fact, we want to do, 
course, is make xn equal to this desired 
point 
i is i rewrite this 
thing, this equation, 
is really an equation in us in 
following form 
i u n times b 
well, thats this term 
then, way to ub an, 
is this term right here 
so, im is im saying, 
this is i would like to solve 
respect to us 
well, i that well, first 
all, this matrix here, b ab 
way to a n b, 
a fancylooking matrix and, in fact, 
an importantlooking matrix 
im going to call this matrix, gamma 
gamma is an n m times n matrix, 
n is dimension state 
m is dimension input 
well, this solution, sorry, this 
equation x is gamma times this u u 
vector a solution in terms us, if 
if rank gamma is equal to 
n 
rank is number linearly 
independent rows columns in gamma 
well, so thats we want to do, 
right we want to somehow a gamma 
thats rich enough 
turns that this thing 
generalizes, this way thinking 
control problem, generalizes quite 
nicely to continuous time systems 
well 
so, if i a continuous time system, 
x dot is axbu, x in rn 
well, first all, this system is 
completely controllable, 
going to call cc 
if is possible to go initial 
state to final state, 
so, meaning, if i start here i want 
to end here, 
there is a u that takes between 
points, 
points, 
thats means system to 
completely controllable 
now, im going to define gamma again, 
is this b ab way to a n 
b 
this is known controllability 
matrix 
here, ladies gentlemen, is 
first theorem this entire course 
controllability theorem complete 
controllability theorem 
system is completely controllable 
if if rank, 
means number linearly 
independent columns gamma rows, 

if if rank gamma is equal 
to n, n is dimension 
system 
so, this is rank test known 
a way checking controllability 
a linear timeinvariance system 
so, lets see happens 
here i two different systems, 
x plus u is first one 
u, 
fine, there an x here, 
way 
so lower one is point mass 
upper one one we actually saw 
that poleplacement possible 
in fact, poleplacement is possible 
lower system possible 
upper system 
this is, in fact, system used we 
couldnt 
well, lets look first all, 
this top system is a twodimensional 
system, 
n 
gamma, in this case, is b ab, 
way a n b 
n so gamma is simply b times ab 
well, lower system also istwo 
dimensional 
gamma is equal b times ab 
well, lets compute ab 
turns to equal to 
upper system if i apply this 
gamma, i get b here ab here 
so, this is , first column , 
second column 
if i multiply first column 
two, i get second column 
so, this thing two linearly 
independent columns 
in fact, one linearly independent 
column 
so, rank gamma is equal to one, 
means, completely 
controllable 
well, looking lower system 
well, this is ab, this is gamma, 
there is way i multiply this 
column anything to get this column 
so, lower gamma rank equal to 
thats two linearly independant 
columns 
so, is completely controlable 
so here, poleplacement possible, 
completely controllable 
here, poleplacement possible, 
completely controllable 
seems like ready theorem 
number 
so, if i u kx, x dot become 
abkx 
this is close loop dynamics 
then, controllability theorem number 
says that poleplacement to arbitrary 
eigenvalues is possible if if 
system is completely controllable 
so, this tells is that we need to 
check controllability 
if we dont complete 
controllability, chances 
going to able to control 
so, this is obstruction to 
poleplacement 
and, in fact lets lets see we would 
actually compute something like this 
real 
so, lets say that i again, 
point, my, system 
well, in matlab, luckily us, we dont 
to compute things 
we say, here is controllability 
matrix 
so, gamma g is controllability ab, 
we check rank 
in this case, we get answer out, 
so, rank g is 
n is , in this case, 
so we indeed, a completely 
controllable system, 
means, i forgot an x there, i 
apologize, 
means that we place poles 
wherever we want we all, also 
means that possible to go between 
two points 
so, lets say that i start here i 
want to go to x 
is possible to go like this well, i 
know possible to go x to x 
turns that you 
go between two points, doesnt 
mean you follow trajectory 
this system, 
point mass, well, x here is 
position, right x is velocity 
well, if im here, that means i a 
positive velocity a positive 
possession 
now, im going to if i start 
moving like this, im going backwards, 
meaning, x is reduced a positive 
velocity there is way i go 
backwards a positive velocity, so 
this is possible 
so, we need to well, here i 
a positive velocity so im going to 
keep growing i reduce 
velocity 
here, i zero velocity, right 
here 
that negative velocity, i start going 
backwards 
sound im going backwards 
then, i start going forward 
to get to x 
so, this is you would to go 
x to x 
so, you cant follow arbitrary 
trajectories system is 
completely controllable, 
you know that you go between 
arbitrary points so, that gives us 
tools that we really need to understand 
we control system that 
tool is controllability
