so, in last lecture, we saw that 
possible to recover state 
outputs using this observer 
structure 
key there to build an 
estimate, a copy state, x hat 
to let dynamics given 
predictor part, is x hat dot this 
ax hat is a copy original 
dynamics 
plus corrector part, that basically 
compares outputs to outputs 
would if x hat indeed 
state, that output would c 
times x hat 
now, we here, is this gain l 
we saw that designing this l, 
like designing a k, youre 
control design and, we really 
need to pull placement 
aerodymamics, so if error, we 
e dot equal to a minus lc 
times e, we needed to stabilize 
that system 
to control sign 
observer sign doesnt always work 
we saw that we needed kind notion 
related to controlability that works 
obsever sign that notion is 
observability so observability is really 
topic todays lecture 
ask controllability, 
easiest to approach this a 
rather modest simple example 
so going to deal a discrete 
time system xk is axk 
output, yk is cxk 
we start somewhere, we x, 
question is, collecting n 
different outputs, we recover 
initial condition meaning we figure 
we started well, time 
output is simply c times x, right 
time , output is c times x 
well, x is a times x, so output 
time is cax 
so forth 
so time, n , output is 
times x 
so ive gathered this little n 
different measurements, ys 
relationship that we is 
this 
looks similar to we in 
controllability case 
in fact, this matrix here is going to 
new main character in 
observability drama 
in fact, this is an important matrix that 
going to call omega 
in fact omega will called the, 
observability matrix, opposed to 
gamma, controllability 
matrix 
now, we in control 
problem, we a similar kind setup, 
we want to able to basically 
invert omega to recover xo this 
stack outputs 
in controlability case, 
this is possible this omega, 
observability matrix full rank 
meaning that number linearly 
independent rows columns is same, 
is equal to little, little m 
luckily, us, 
controllability, this result 
generalizes to case that 
actually interested in 
is, continuous time x is ax, y 
is cx 
so, observability, in general 
means that system is completely 
observable, im going to call co, 
if is possible to recover initial 
state output 
thats basically means 
i collect enough outputs, there 
im able to tell you system 
started 
like controllability, we 
a matrix 
this case omega is 
observability matrix theorem number 
mirrors exactly theorem number in 
controllability case as, so this is 
controllability complete observability 
theorem number 
says system is completely 
observable if if rank 
omega is equal to little n meaning this 
observability matrix full rank 
before, rank is simply 
number linearly independent number 
rows columns matrix in 
this case 
now, we second theorem, 
follows directly in way 
control ability 
so, if i this observer 
dynamics, i find error 
dynamics e simply is actual 
state minus state estimate 
well, i wanted to course, is 
drive e to , thats i would like 
well, theorem number two tells that 
this is possible, 
if if, using poleplacements to 
arbitrary eigenvalues 
if if, system is completely 
observable 
so, we an exact dual to 
controlability designing 
observers 
in fact, designing observers, 
estimating state, is really 
thing control design 
happens that stabilizing 
aerodynamics instead stabilizing 
state 
so this is good news, right, 
we actually figure state 
is 
so we very, close to 
able to design controllers if we 
x, 
we dont, we y, we use y 
to figure an estimate x 
so going to in next 
lecture is simply put weve done 
control design side, 
observant design side together, in order 
to able to actually control liner 
systems we dont state 
we is
