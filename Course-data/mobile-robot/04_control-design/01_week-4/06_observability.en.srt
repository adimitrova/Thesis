1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,628
So, in the last lecture, we saw that it 
was possible to recover the state from 

2
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:08,837
the outputs using this observer 
structure. 

3
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:14,093
And the key there was to build an 
estimate, or a copy of the state, x hat. 

4
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:19,545
And to let the dynamics be given by the 
predictor part, which is x hat dot this 

5
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:23,182
ax hat which is a copy of the original 
dynamics. 

6
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:29,652
Plus the corrector part, that basically 
compares the outputs to what the outputs 

7
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:35,862
would have been if x hat was indeed the 
state, and that output would have been C 

8
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:39,707
times X hat. 
Now, what we have here, is this gain L. 

9
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:45,604
And we saw that designing this L, was 
just like designing A K, when you're 

10
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:51,218
doing control design and, what we really 
need to do then was just pull placement 

11
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:56,695
on the aerodymamics, so if the error, we 
had e dot now being equal to A minus LC 

12
00:00:56,695 --> 00:01:00,552
times E, and we just needed to stabilize 
that system. 

13
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:05,986
But just with to control the sign 
observer the sign doesn't always work and 

14
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:11,937
we saw that we needed some kind of notion 
related to controlability that works for 

15
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:17,592
obsever the sign and that notion is 
observability So observability is really 

16
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:22,764
the topic of today's lecture. 
And just ask for controllability, 

17
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:28,930
it's easiest to approach this with a 
rather modest and simple example. 

18
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,716
So we're going to deal with a discrete 
time system where xk + 1 is Axk and the 

19
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:40,967
output, yk is Cxk. 
And we start somewhere, we have some X0, 

20
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:47,108
and the question is, by collecting N 
different outputs, can we recover the 

21
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:53,857
initial condition? Meaning can we figure 
out where we started from? Well, at time 

22
00:01:53,857 --> 00:02:00,080
0 the output is simply C times X0, right? 
At time 1, the output is C times X1. 

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,682
Well, X1 is A times X0, so the output at 
time 1 is CAx0. 

24
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:10,082
And so forth. 
So at time, n - 1, the output is CA^n - 1 

25
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:14,334
times X0. 
So now I've gathered this little n 

26
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:20,285
different measurements, or y's. 
And the relationship that we have is 

27
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,287
this. 
It looks very similar to what we had in 

28
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:27,392
the controllability case. 
And in fact, this matrix here is going to 

29
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:30,792
be the new main character in the 
observability drama. 

30
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:35,092
In fact, this is an important matrix that 
we're going to call omega. 

31
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:41,167
In fact omega will be called the, 
observability matrix, as opposed to 

32
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:45,002
gamma, which was the controllability 
matrix. 

33
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:51,272
Now, just as we had in the control 
problem, we have a similar kind of setup, 

34
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:57,192
where we want to be able to basically 
invert omega to recover Xo from this 

35
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:01,908
stack of outputs. 
And just as in the controlability case, 

36
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:07,962
this is possible when this omega, the 
observability matrix has full rank. 

37
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:14,200
Meaning that the number of linearly 
independent rows or columns is the same, 

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,071
is equal to little, little m. 
And luckily, for us, 

39
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,964
just as for controllability, this result 
generalizes to the case that we're 

40
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:29,149
actually interested in. 
Which is, the continuous time x is ax, y 

41
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:32,622
is Cx. 
So, observability, in general. 

42
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:36,998
Means that the system is completely 
observable, which I'm going to call CO, 

43
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:40,755
if it is possible to recover the initial 
state from the output. 

44
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:45,131
That's basically what it means. 
I collect enough outputs, and from there 

45
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,889
I'm able to tell you where the system 
started. 

46
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,497
And just like for controllability, we 
have a matrix. 

47
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,658
This case it's omega which is the 
observability matrix and theorem number 1 

48
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:02,181
mirrors exactly theorem number 1 in the 
controllability case its as, so this is 

49
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:06,372
controllability complete observability 
theorem number 1. 

50
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:11,396
It says the system is completely 
observable if and only if the rank of 

51
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:16,912
omega is equal to little n meaning this 
observability matrix has full rank. 

52
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:22,510
Now as before, the rank is simply the 
number of linearly independent number of 

53
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,531
rows or columns of the matrix only in 
this case. 

54
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:32,428
Now, we have the second theorem, it 
follows directly in the same way as it 

55
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:37,290
did for control ability. 
So, if I have this as my observer 

56
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,034
dynamics, and then I find the error 
dynamics where e simply is the actual 

57
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:48,070
state minus my state estimate. 
Well, what I wanted to do of course, is 

58
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,026
drive e to 0, that's what I would like. 
Well, theorem number two tells me that 

59
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:58,072
this is possible, 
if and only if, using pole-placements to 

60
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,192
arbitrary eigenvalues. 
If and only if, the system is completely 

61
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,719
observable. 
So, we have an exact dual to 

62
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,767
controlability when we're designing 
observers. 

63
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:12,652
And in fact, designing observers, or 
estimating the state, is really the same 

64
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:17,023
thing as doing control design. 
It just happens that we're stabilizing 

65
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,358
aerodynamics instead of stabilizing the 
state. 

66
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:26,022
So this is good news, right, because now 
we can actually figure out what the state 

67
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:29,008
is. 
So we are very, very close now to being 

68
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,944
able to design controllers as if we had 
x, 

69
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:36,789
which we don't, we have y, but we use y 
to figure out an estimate on x. 

70
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:42,391
So what we're going to do in the next 
lecture is simply put what we've done on 

71
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:48,078
the control design side, and on the 
observant design side together, in order 

72
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:53,765
to be able to actually control liner 
systems where we don't have the state but 

73
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,505
all we do have is the out
