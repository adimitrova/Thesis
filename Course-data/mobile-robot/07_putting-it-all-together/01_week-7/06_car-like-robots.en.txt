The punchline with the previous lecture 
was the POS, meaning position and heading, is central in a lot of different 
situations. and we made the claim that, other POS-based models, like cars or 
underwater gliders, or other kinds of autonomous vehicles, can be made to look 
like a unicycle. Today, I want to make this observation 
precise and concrete by looking at the car-like robots. 
So, for instance, there's a picture of our autonomous car out of Georgia Tech. 
And the question is, how do we make this thing look like a 
unicycle? Well, the first thing we need is a model. 
And the standard car kinematics is to add another state to the system, which is the 
steering handle. So here is the picture that we have in 
mind. The, the rear wheel wheels are just 
pointing in whatever direction the car is going which it or the car is facing, 
which is the orientation phi. The position of the car, well, we're 
going to take this point which is in the middle in between the front wheels. 
And this distance here is going to be l. So, the rear wheels are l away from the 
front wheels. And then, we have this angle which we're 
going to call psi. So, what we're actually going to end up 
doing is moving the car in this direction. 
And the direction then is psi+phi. So, if we make this observation into a 
model, we first see that the states are x, y, 
phi, and psi steering angle. The inputs now that we're going to have 
are, as before, the speed. 
How quickly is the car going? And, how fast are we turning the steering wheel? 
I'm going to call this sigma. Angular steering velocity, or steering 
angle velocity. The model then becomes, 
well, x-dot and v-dot is as before v cosin and then the direction we're going 
in. But the direction we're going in is now 
psi+phi. Then, we have an equation that relates 
the steering angle and the velocity to the heading of the car. 
And then, the last component is that we can immediately influence the velocity of 
the steering angle, so how quickly are we turning the, the wheel. 
Okay, good. Now, what we're going to do is pick sigma 
and v in a clever enough way to make this thing become a unicycle. 
Well, let's start then with the unicycle itself. 
So, this is our car model. Well, let's start with our unicycle model and do 
something called curvature control. So, what this means is that if I want to 
drive along a particular circular arc, let's say that the radius of the arc is 
raw. And here's the car, it's going, sorry, 
the unicycle it's going, do, do, do, do, do, right? This is the direction in which 
it's going so the orientation in the unicycle, this angle is just phi. 
Well, here's alpha and simple geometry tells me that alpha is just phi minus pi 
over 2. Okay. 
If I'm describing how this thing is evolving along a circular arc, 
then I get, for instance, that the x position is simply, 
let's say that the center of the circle is x0, y0. 
Then, x is simply x0 + rho cosine alpha. But because alpha is phi minus pi over 2, 
I can write this is x dot plus rho sine alpha, 
thanls to one of my favorite trigonometric identities. 
Well, if I take the derivative of this with respect to time, I get that, well, 
this thing the derivative of that is zero. 
The time derivative of this, phi dot is equal to omega. 
So, my x dot becomes omega rho cosine phi. 
But, wait a second. I know what x dot is, 
it's v cosine phi because it's a unicycle. 
So now, these two expressions have to be the same. 
Which means that the radius of the circle is v over omega. 
Now, a lot of times, we care about what's called curvature. 
And curvature is 1 over the radius. So, the curvature is simply 1 over rho. 
Which means that the curvature I would get if I have omega and v, 
well, it's omega over v. So, the bigger the omega is, the tighter 
the circle, meaning the higher the curvature. 
If omega is zero, I'm going at a, in a straight line and the curvature is zero. 
So, this is the curvature of a unicycle. Okay. Let's figure what the curvature is 
when we have a car. The only difference now is that the you, 
the car is actually pointing in this direction but it's going in this 
direction because of the fact we have a steering angle. 
So, as before, alpha, this angle where we wanted to say where the car is, is, 
well, it's phi plus psi minus pi over 2. So, we're doing exactly what we did 
before. x is x0 plus rho where rho is the radius 
of the circle, sine phi plus psi. 
Taking the derivative, we get x dot is rho phi plus psi cosine phi plus psi. 
Now, let's assume that we're driving on a circle. 
This means that we're going to hold the steering wheel fixed. 
Which means that this term is going to be equal to zero because we're not changing 
the steering angel, right? So, we know that psi dot is zero. 
Well, we also have the equation for phi dot, it looks like v/l sine phi, sorry, 
psi, v/l sine psi. And, we also know that x dot should be 
equal to this expression. So, what do we do? 
Well, we simply now line up v here and rho phi dot there to get the curvature. 
Sorry, to get the radius of the circle. 
So, this becomes l divided by sine psi. And now, we invert this to get the 
curvature. So, the curvature becomes sine psi over l 
where psi is this fixed steering angle we're driving. 
Okay. Then, we have curvature for the unicycle, 
this thing. Curvature for the car, 
that thing. Well, we just put them equal, right? Why 
not? If we put them equal, then we immediately get that sine psi should be 
equal to omega l/v. So this is the steering angle we, if I 
have a unicycle that's driving at omega and v, then this is what the steering 
angle should be to get the same behavior out. Which also means that my psi then 
should be arcsin of, well, omega l/v. Well, I can't set psi directly. 
So, what I need to do is say that this is my desired steering angle. 
And then, I somehow need to make my actual steering angle become close to my 
desired steering angle. That's the name of the game here, 
right? So when we get these arcsin, or arcsine 
sorry. psi d is arc sinus of omega l/v. 
Okay. Now, arcsin is a little bit of an 
annoying thing to have to do. So instead, we're not going to do that. 
So, let's say that I have this thing and I would like d to be close to it. 
Well, one thing I can do is a simple P-Regulator, which is something you've 
seen. But 
this thing involves this arcsin and one thing to note is what happen if actually 
keep sinus in there while we would get something kind of cleaner, 
right? So, let's get rid of it and simply say 
that instead of psi here, I'm going to do sine of psi. 
And instead of omega d then, I'm going to do sine omega d. 
So, I keep saying omega, I mean psi, sin psi d, which we know is omega l over v, 
which goes in there, right? 
So, we keep the sinuses in there instead of taking arcsin. 
And the reason for that is that for small enough angles this is, this is roughly 
equal to the angle itself. So, sinus is, is not a bad thing to do. 
well, let's see if this works. So over on the left there, you see the 
unicycle, and over on the right you see the car. 
And the unicycle has some omega and v, and the car is running the sinus version 
of P-Regulator. And, as you can see, they're pretty 
close, which means that we can basically do the same kind of curvature control on 
the car as we can do on the unicycle. So, the moral of the story with this is, 
you know what? We're planning. We're getting some direction we want to 
move in. Here is my direction I want to move in. 
Well, we know the clever trick. The trick, right? The trick gives us v and 
omega, which is what are the speeds and angular velocities we would like. 
We now also know that the curvature is omega over v. So, if you give me v and 
omega, I can tell you what the curvature is going to look like. 
Well, let's use this curvature idea to make the car track the unicycle which 
gives us v and sigma. And, of course, this v is the same as 
that v. So, we don't have to do anything about 
it. The only thing we have to do, is to add 
what sigma should actually be. And this, ladies and gentlemen, allows us 
to make the car act like a unicycle simply by using this curvature idea. 
And this generalizes to other types of unicycle like systems where POS, again, 
is really important.
