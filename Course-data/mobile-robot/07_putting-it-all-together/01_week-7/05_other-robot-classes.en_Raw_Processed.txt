punch line last lecture that 
we can, in fact, make unicycle model 
a differential drive mobile robot, act 
like a simple x dot equal to u 
this means is that if we 
desired direction we want to go in, 
direction magnitude, we come 
vs omegas, speeds angular 
velocities that make differential 
drive robot execute this controller 
we in two ways 
first, we saw that we actually use 
kind tracking controller to 
follow this 
then, in last lecture, we came 
a rather clever transformation that 
allowed us to, to actually track this u 
vector less perfectly 
i say less, i mean 
is that we really ignored orientation 
so, we cared robot 
actually was, 
particularly direction 
pointing 
we couldnt track used 
original point, we to accept this 
small offset error 
rather elegant, 
longer we to design trackers 
question one ask then, 
course, is this apply to types 
robots meaning, this idea starting 
a unicycle somehow making 
behave well, 
how, relevant is that to kinds 
robots so, we dealt 
differential drive robots 
we know that super important in 
relevance to that you know what, 
if you flying things if you 
snake bots if you have, this 
is called a snake board, if you 
fixedwing aircrafts blimps 
underwater robots this even apply 
well, 
i want to today is basically see 
that supply but, supply 
if you squint eyes a little bit 
focus types robots 
in common opposed to dont 
in common 
so, i want to today is simply go 
a smorgasbord different robot 
classes see actually 
like unicycles maybe 
well see 
okay 
heres unicycle, 
right we have, always, position, x y, 
pointing in direction, 
phi, this is standard robot model 
so, states position 
orientation 
inputs to this model, this 
abstraction, angular 
transalational velocitiies 
meaning, quickly you turn 
fast you go 
well, lets start expanding this model to 
encompass slightly elaborate 
systems 
so, lets start whats called a 
carlike robot 
a carlike robot is a unicycle 
a sudden, we 
states 
we old friends is x y, 
is position 
we phi is orientation, 
we also a new angle known 
steering angle 
so, here is picture we in 
mind 
heres a car, here rear wheels 
well, front wheels going to 
turned turning steering 
wheel 
so, if i call this point here, x y, 
always, this, course, is, 
before, heading 
now, we also this angle here, 
is psi, known steering 
angle, 
much we actually steering 
i wanted to show here is that we 
almost equation x y, 
difference is that we going 
in this direction, is phi plus psi 
then, orientation 
dynamics thats a function 
velocity steering angle 
then, we is we 
control quickly steering 
so, psi dot is equal to u 
so, this is next level in 
complexity we longer a 
unicycle a carlike robot, four 
wheels we turn front wheels 
well weve already seen segway robot 
so, segway robot is really a unicycle 
a differential drive robot 
base 
then, you know, this, this mess here 
i drew like this actually 
didnt fit in box if i didnt make 
small sideways 
point is that, we a rather 
complicated equation describing 
pendulum part part thats sitting 
top unicycle 
so, we a bunch states, position, 
orientation, tilt, angle, here, we 
actually to deal tilt 
velocities kinds velocities 
we actually need to get 
dynamics 
many accelerations whats happening 
this thing to fall 
inputs wheel torques to this 
model 
point is that this still a 
unicycle underneath this mass 
sitting top 
so, that would, would segway robot 
that we actually already seen 
well, flying things well, a 
standard model a fixedwing aircraft 
is tada, a unicycle, right means, 
moving 
then, change altitude 
so now, one in right mind would 
actually say that this is a, 
an aircraft is actually a 
high level obstruction point view, 
a bad idea 
an aircraft cant go sideways 
kind move like a unicyle in, in 
plane 
then, you change altitude 
now, you would actually to couple 
this to real dynamics aircraft 
if you wanted to real 
one thing to note though is that 
there is something slightly fishy 
this thats fact that fixed 
wing aircraft cannot hover 
you cant v, theres 
really constraint way 
capturing this in, this model, we see 
later to it, point here is 
that there ways thinking 
flying things unicycles plus an 
altitude component 
now, lets look another model 
this is standard model an 
underwater glider, 
and, well, lets go back a slide 
aircraft, underwater glider, nothing 
changed, right 
so, an underwater glider, people 
typically model a unicycle 
then, you go 
so, you go to a lower depth 
you could climb towards surface 
so, again, unicycle plus an altitude a 
vertical component that describes 
high high the, robot 
actually is 
well, 
robots notion 
is least in plane 
pointing 
if i call position plus heading 
pose, punchline, least based 
models i showed you, cars, segways, 
flying things, things water, 
we know, differential drive robots, 
this key thing to known 
pose 
pose is x, y, phi 
you know, thats just, thats whats 
going on, is way is 
pointing 
pointing in phi direction 
instead x y 
well, you know what, if you ignore 
dynamics, actual dynamics say 
certain high level abstraction, we 
already know we think 
this, 
unicycle so, almost everything 
involves a pose 
almost everything pose is almost 
a unicycle i will make this 
precise 
point here is that whenever you 
start dealing postion heading, 
unicycle model is applicable, maybe 
perfectly, fairly well 
so, this model is still very, rich 
so, punchline becomes that we 
almost use everything that weve 
already done possibly add 
another layer to to whats going 
so, you have, is you have, lets 
say, your, u plan, right, that comes 
unit cycle, that 
comes old friends, v omega, 
then, whatever actual robot you is 
going to move like this 
sound point is that, in here, 
we may forced to somehow make 
actual robot look like a unicycle a 
little bit 
another layer to 
already elegant welllayered 
architecture that weve discussed 
and, in fact, next time, i want to 
is exactly this car robot, to 
see you make a car act like a 
unicycle this is something i to 
i dealing autonomous 
selfdriving cars 
we reasoning level 
position orientation speeds 
angular velocities we 
to map back onto the, onto the, 
car robot 
we that though, i need to talk 
a little bit constraints 
i mean, mean that is if youre 
flying, instance, 
you cant hover 
youre going to a certain minimum 
velocity a lot times, 
convenient to assume a fixed velocity 
you turn 
heres an aircraft 
cant immediately quickly 
spin either 
so, there caps quickly you 
actually turn 
well, famous constrained 
unicycle type models is known dubins 
vehicle is is a unicycle 
added caveat that we fly 
v drive v, meaning 
going to go a constant velocity 
we a max a minimum angular 
velocity 
if you want, you say, you know, v 
there omega v max omega max plus 
omega max instead , 
point is that constraining 
velocities 
this means, that dubins vehicle 
basically execute straight lines, 
go along paths like this so, so go 
along angles, i mean, along circular 
arcs 
go anything in between, 
right basically, you have, you 
cannot go arbitrarily tight a dubins 
vehicle 
so, this is one way in people 
incorporate constraints 
this makes planning part 
significantly harder 
going to cover it, i 
encourage you to look dubins vehicles, 
instance, to see people think 
curvature constrained versions 
unicycles, instance 
well, another version another standard 
constraint that people deal is 
whats known reedsshepp model, 
omega again, is between , 
negative omega max omega max, 
v be, well, absolute value 
v is , means that v is either 
, meaning a dubins vehicle that 
also go backwards 
thats that this means 
you go forward along arcs 
you actually pull back in in reverse 
reedsshepp is also a standard type 
model that people like to deal 
theyre dealing mobile robots 
now, aircrafts typically cant back so 
a par, that relevant a 
model fixed wind aircraft, 
instance 
there are, instance, robots, 
end day, we a top 
speed, instance, 
so we cant go faster vvmax, so, 
we indeed go backwards 
so, reedsshepp model would a 
bad model if you actually want to take 
max velocities account 
so, remember that this may may 
come play 
last thing i want to say though is 
that there are, course, robots 
pose is a reasonable way 
describing 
you know, you a humanoid, well, 
people will maybe a position 
orientation there is so much 
going in a humanoid 
a snake, you know, way is snake 
pointing, well, you know, if snake 
looks like this, whats, whats 
orientation snake 
unclear 
whats position snake 
knows clear we mean 
that 
thing, we would like mobile 
manipulators like this robots that we 
here georgia tech, where, well, 
base is a unicycle 
so, if you care base, 
fine 
if you want to things like 
carry things around opening doors 
so forth, we to care 
pose, 
position orientation 
so, there situations we to 
worry things, in a 
surprising amount situations, pose is 
indeed way to go 
like i said, next lecture will 
cars to actually make a car 
behave like a unicycle
