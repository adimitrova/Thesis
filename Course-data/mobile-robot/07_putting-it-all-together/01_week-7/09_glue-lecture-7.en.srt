00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,340
Hi, and welcome to the Glue Lectures for
control of mobile robots.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,660
This is the last Glue Lecture, Glue
Lecture 7.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,340
And I really hope that you guys have
enjoyed the course

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,380
and learned a lot of awesome things, are
super excited about robotics.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,440
I hope you are.
So, this Glue Lecture is just going to be.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Basically the course in a nutshell in a
very

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,010
big nutshell, in the sense of a very broad
overview.

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,270
Basically what we think from a layman's
perspective is like the best

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,800
thing you got out of the course, you know,
really simple stuff.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,860
Because your quiz is also going to kind of
go over what you've done.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,130
All this while etcetera.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,540
So this is what the glue lecture is about.
The first

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,010
thing that I think was amazing about this
entire course is the fact that, you know,

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,880
we saw how math can be related to motion.
How we can actually visually see.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,060
Equations turn into motion.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,340
So if you guys remember here we have this

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,590
pink ball that's moving happily in this
corner, you know.

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,380
And from the new lectures and the course
we saw that the

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,920
motion of this ball can actually

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,970
be described through equations or through
math.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,180
Not only can the motion be described, but
we can actually

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,980
derive the motion.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,480
Through something called a dynamical
model, or dynamical

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,580
models in this case, we have this here,
right?

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,840
Which is also math, and then from this we
can

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,142
actually get how this ball is moving with
time, right.

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,240
So, this was an example we saw in the glue
lectures.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,470
Basically, you have a dynamical model that

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,360
describes the velocity and where the ball
wakes

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
up at a particular time, and then kind of
find

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,800
out how the ball is going to change with
respect to time.

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,590
Really simple.

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,070
The whole point is that, you know, we all

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,210
saw how math basically translates to
motion, which is great.

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,420
Then we also saw that okay, since this
course is about robots, right?

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,660
So we read a few dynamical

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,530
models of the robots.

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,030
So this is the most common robot that is
there,

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,130
basically, or that we deal with, a
two-wheel differential drive robot.

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,660
And we saw that, you know what, we can
write the model of

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,745
this guy through this equation here, or
through the set of equations here.

42
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,240
Where you control the angular velocities
of the

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,760
right and left wheel of the robot, right?

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,880
And then we also saw that you can simplify

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,700
the model even farther, and make it a
unicycle

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,216
robot, with just like one wheel, and
basically.

47
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:41,870
This figure here.

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,630
And you can control the velocity and the
angular velocity of this simplified model.

49
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,910
The good thing about this was the fact
that, you

50
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,540
know what, this simplified model can be
used for design.

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,780
And then we have a beautiful
transformation on or relation basically

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,593
between these two models that once we
design our v and omega for

53
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:07,660
the simplified model, we can just, you
know, put it on to the differential.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,030
Rate model and and find out vr and vi to
give to the robots, right?

55
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,660
And actually this week with Dr. Edgarsted
you learned another even simpler model.

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,070
Not even a model but a simpler thing
called x dot equal to u.

57
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,310
Basically where,

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,870
you know, you don't even want to control
let's

59
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,570
say the vel, linear velocity and the
angular velocity.

60
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,950
Instead you just directly going to
control, you know, x dot.

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,360
Equal to u.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,660
And, and then you learn this very nice
transformation that allows you

63
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,460
to transform this x star equal to u
directly to your reason omegas.

64
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,660
Right?

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,880
So, now all of the sudden you don't even

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,660
have to design your controller based on
this model.

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,020
You just design it based off this guy
here.

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,530
You know, map it back to v and omega
model, map that back

69
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,690
to your vr vm model, and you're really
good to go, just excellent.

70
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,540
Another thing that you learned in this

71
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,370
week's lecture was the car-like model
where you

72
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,090
have a current, all you do is there is you
include this steering angle psi.

73
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,220
Into your correlate model, and then you

74
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,310
can even map that model onto the

75
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,960
simplified model, and the simplified model
onto whatever.

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,900
So on and so forth.

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,180
You're good to go.

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,220
So this was how math translates to motion

79
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,570
and basically what is a dynamical model,
or.

80
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,460
How do we start with any robotics problem
we

81
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,310
start with the model so this is what that
is.

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,740
okay.

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,290
This is one

84
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,900
excellent thing.

85
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,130
The second thing that we learned in the
course was systems, so now that we know

86
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,960
how a model of a, you know robot or
anything we want to control is.

87
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,590
Described through math.
Now we want to influence it, right?

88
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,810
We want to control it.
We want it to do certain things.

89
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,720
So that's when this whole idea of systems
comes in that

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,130
okay, we're going to have an input, we're
going to have an output.

91
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,330
And we're going to actually describe

92
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,880
our system through these three matrices.
A, B and C.

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,620
Again, something that we went over
extensively in class.

94
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,530
And your system can now again, of course,
be a

95
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,492
robot, here it's a Capera robot, here
there's a humanoid.

96
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,433
Now robot.

97
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:27,660
Anything for which you can find your A, B
and C matrices.

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,640
Now A matrix, just remember.

99
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,240
Is your model, which we just discussed
right now,

100
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,390
right?
It's something that's given.

101
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,360
Something that's from the physics or from
basically the device.

102
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,450
B matrix is actually something that we
construct, that describes the actuators.

103
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,290
Basically, what are the actuators on this
model or

104
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,160
on this robot, in particular, that we can
control?

105
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,680
And that information is encoded in the B
matrix and

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,030
then the C matrix of course is, what can
we measure?

107
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,070
Or what's

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,760
the output?

109
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,610
Wha, what are the sensors on this robot
from which we can get our output?

110
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,570
And together, A, B and C will make you
make the system.

111
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,020
Yeah.
So that's awesome.

112
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,280
Right?

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,460
And this is extremely important because
once you have the model and now you have

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,900
the system and now you have everything you
need to do cool things with the robot.

115
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,970
Which is precisely what the slide says.

116
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,840
We can make robots do basically anything.
Well, not anything but.

117
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,170
You know, close enough.

118
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,220
And, in this lecture, or sorry, in this
course,

119
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,940
basically what we saw was that, you know
what,

120
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,080
once we have our model and then we create
our

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,850
system for the model A, B and C matrices,
etcetera,

122
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,450
then, we can in fact make sure that our
system.

123
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,170
Robot, with, you know, sensors, actuators,
and the, everything, does

124
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,460
not blow up, does not end up doing
anything random.

125
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,730
It stays stable.

126
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,280
And we also do this whole controllability,
observability analysis,

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,400
which is very important in order to make
the robot actually do anything.

128
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Before you can even start talking about
controlling the robot.

129
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,280
Etcetera.

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,370
You need to know that, you know, is it
controllable, is it

131
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,470
observable, do I in fact have the ability
to do all these things.

132
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,830
We did all this extensively in class.

133
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,730
Another very cool thing that we learned
was this whole

134
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,330
automata, our hybrid controls notion, you
know, that you can.

135
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,300
For a robot to do some task you can

136
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,120
actually divide up this task into make
small, small

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,510
behaviors that the robot does and then
kind of

138
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,730
mash all these behaviors together and into
this automata thing.

139
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,830
And then also we learned that once you do
this you know there are undesirable

140
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,130
things like the zeno effect for instance
and how do you get rid of it.

141
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,930
And a lot of other things that we saw in
this course, right?

142
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:59,050
What is great though, was that we did all
this with math.

143
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,210
So, by the end of this course, you guys
have actually learned about differential

144
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,350
equations, linear algebra, geometry, a lot
of these awesome tools that.

145
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,840
Can you make you, you know, actually do
such nice stuff with the robots visually.

146
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,080
Not only just in software simulation but

147
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,130
you actually see it happening.
You know, in front of you.

148
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,660
Which is great.

149
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,100
And on the same track if you can make
robots do anything.

150
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,120
These are two robots, the humanoid robots
in our lab.

151
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,640
The now and one guy is doing a cheer
leading the

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,450
team and the other one is doing a disco
dancing routine.

153
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,280
This is Emy Lavier's work when she was a

154
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,830
grad student at George Dake, in our lab
and basically

155
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,390
she has a command of this entire thing

156
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,500
based of this course of, of hybrid
automators etcetera.

157
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,020
Right in front of you guys we are

158
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,230
actually making robots dance, which is
great, right?

159
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,320
And, you can see more amazing videos and
stuff about, you know, what

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,800
a lab does or what the robots do on the
GRITSLab YouTube Channel.

161
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,920
For more

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,370
stuff, and anyway this is us signing off.

163
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,380
Me, Swati Chopra and the robots on behalf
of Amy Leviers.

164
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,750
And good luck with quiz seven and the rest
of your lives.

165
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,376
And bye, bye.

166
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,830
