punchline previous lecture 
pos, meaning position 
heading, is central in a lot different 
situations we made claim that, 
posbased models, like cars 
underwater gliders, kinds 
autonomous vehicles, made to look 
like a unicycle 
today, i want to make this observation 
precise concrete looking 
carlike robots 
so, instance, theres a picture 
autonomous car georgia tech 
question is, 
we make this thing look like a 
unicycle well, first thing we need 
is a model 
standard car kinematics is to add 
another state to system, is 
steering handle 
so here is picture that we in 
mind 
the, rear wheel wheels 
pointing in whatever direction car is 
going car is facing, 
is orientation phi 
position car, well, 
going to take this point is in 
middle in between front wheels 
this distance here is going to l 
so, rear wheels l away 
front wheels 
then, we this angle 
going to call psi 
so, actually going to end 
is moving car in this 
direction 
direction is psiphi 
so, if we make this observation a 
model, 
we first see that states x, y, 
phi, psi steering angle 
inputs that going to 
are, 
before, speed 
quickly is car going and, 
fast we turning steering wheel 
im going to call this sigma 
angular steering velocity, steering 
angle velocity 
model becomes, 
well, xdot vdot is v 
cosin direction going 
in 
direction going in is 
psiphi 
then, we an equation that relates 
steering angle velocity to 
heading car 
then, last component is that we 
immediately influence velocity 
steering angle, so quickly we 
turning the, wheel 
okay, good 
now, going to is pick sigma 
v in a clever enough way to make this 
thing become a unicycle 
well, lets start unicycle 

so, this is car model well, lets 
start unicycle model 
something called curvature control 
so, this means is that if i want to 
drive along a particular circular arc, 
lets say that radius arc is 
raw 
heres car, going, sorry, 
unicycle going, do, do, do, do, 
do, right this is direction in 
going so orientation in 
unicycle, this angle is phi 
well, heres alpha simple geometry 
tells that alpha is phi minus pi 

okay 
if im describing this thing is 
evolving along a circular arc, 
i get, instance, that x 
position is simply, 
lets say that center circle 
is x, y 
then, x is simply x rho cosine alpha 
alpha is phi minus pi , 
i write this is x dot plus rho sine 
alpha, 
thanls to one favorite 
trigonometric identities 
well, if i take derivative this 
respect to time, i get that, well, 
this thing derivative that is 
zero 
time derivative this, 
phi dot is equal to omega 
so, x dot becomes omega rho cosine 
phi 
but, wait a second 
i know x dot is, 
v cosine phi a 
unicycle 
so now, two expressions to 

means that radius circle 
is v omega 
now, a lot times, we care whats 
called curvature 
curvature is radius 
so, curvature is simply rho 
means that curvature i would 
get if i omega v, 
well, omega v 
so, bigger omega is, tighter 
circle, meaning higher 
curvature 
if omega is zero, im going a, in a 
straight line curvature is zero 
so, this is curvature a unicycle 
okay lets figure curvature is 
we a car 
difference is that you, 
car is actually pointing in this 
direction going in this 
direction fact we a 
steering angle 
so, before, alpha, this angle we 
wanted to say car is, is, 
well, phi plus psi minus pi 
so, exactly we 

x is x plus rho rho is radius 
circle, 
sine phi plus psi 
taking derivative, we get x dot is 
rho phi plus psi cosine phi plus psi 
now, lets assume that driving a 
circle 
this means that going to hold 
steering wheel fixed 
means that this term is going to 
equal to zero changing 
steering angel, 
right so, we know that psi dot is zero 
well, we also equation phi 
dot, looks like vl sine phi, sorry, 
psi, vl sine psi 
and, we also know that x dot 
equal to this expression 
so, we 
well, we simply line v here 
rho phi dot there to get curvature 
sorry, 
to get radius circle 
so, this becomes l divided sine psi 
now, we invert this to get 
curvature 
so, curvature becomes sine psi l 
psi is this fixed steering angle 
driving 
okay 
then, we curvature unicycle, 
this thing 
curvature car, 
that thing 
well, we put equal, right 
if we put equal, we 
immediately get that sine psi 
equal to omega lv 
so this is steering angle we, if i 
a unicycle thats driving omega 
v, this is steering 
angle to get behavior 
also means that psi 
arcsin of, well, omega lv 
well, i cant set psi directly 
so, i need to is say that this is 
desired steering angle 
then, i somehow need to make 
actual steering angle become close to 
desired steering angle 
thats name game here, 
right 
so we get arcsin, arcsine 
sorry 
psi d is arc sinus omega lv 
okay 
now, arcsin is a little bit an 
annoying thing to to 
so instead, going to that 
so, lets say that i this thing 
i would like d to close to 
well, one thing i is a simple 
pregulator, is something youve 
seen 

this thing involves this arcsin one 
thing to note is happen if actually 
keep sinus in there while we would get 
something kind cleaner, 
right 
so, lets get rid simply say 
that instead psi here, im going to 
sine psi 
instead omega d then, im going to 
sine omega d 
so, i keep saying omega, i mean psi, sin 
psi d, we know is omega l v, 
goes in there, 
right 
so, we keep sinuses in there instead 
taking arcsin 
reason that is that small 
enough angles this is, this is roughly 
equal to angle 
so, sinus is, is a bad thing to 
well, lets see if this works 
so left there, you see 
unicycle, right you see 
car 
unicycle omega v, 
car is running sinus version 
pregulator 
and, you see, theyre pretty 
close, means that we basically 
kind curvature control 
car we unicycle 
so, moral story this is, 
you know planning 
getting direction we want to 
move in 
here is direction i want to move in 
well, we know clever trick 
trick, right trick gives us v 
omega, is speeds 
angular velocities we would like 
we also know that curvature is 
omega v so, if you give v 
omega, i tell you curvature 
is going to look like 
well, lets use this curvature idea to 
make car track unicycle 
gives us v sigma 
and, course, this v is 
that v 
so, we dont to anything 

thing we to do, is to add 
sigma actually 
this, ladies gentlemen, allows us 
to make car act like a unicycle 
simply using this curvature idea 
this generalizes to types 
unicycle like systems pos, again, 
is really important
