hi, welcome to glue lectures 
control mobile robots 
this is last glue lecture, glue 
lecture 
i really hope that you guys 
enjoyed course 
learned a lot awesome things, 
super excited robotics 
i hope you 
so, this glue lecture is going to 
basically course in a nutshell in a 

big nutshell, in sense a broad 
overview 
basically we think a laymans 
perspective is like best 
thing you got course, you know, 
really simple stuff 
quiz is also going to kind 
go youve done 
this while etcetera 
so this is glue lecture is 
first 
thing that i think amazing this 
entire course is fact that, you know, 
we saw math related to motion 
we actually visually see 
equations turn motion 
so if you guys remember here we this 
pink ball thats moving happily in this 
corner, you know 
new lectures course 
we saw that 
motion this ball actually 
described equations 
math 
motion described, 
we actually 
derive motion 
something called a dynamical 
model, dynamical 
models in this case, we this here, 
right 
is also math, this we 

actually get this ball is moving 
time, right 
so, this an example we saw in glue 
lectures 
basically, you a dynamical model that 
describes velocity ball 
wakes 
a particular time, kind 
find 
ball is going to change 
respect to time 
really simple 
whole point is that, you know, we 
saw math basically translates to 
motion, is great 
we also saw that okay, since this 
course is robots, right 
so we read a few dynamical 
models robots 
so this is common robot that is 
there, 
basically, that we deal with, a 
twowheel differential drive robot 
we saw that, you know what, we 
write model 
this guy this equation here, 
set equations here 
you control angular velocities 

right left wheel robot, right 
we also saw that you simplify 
model even farther, make a 
unicycle 
robot, like one wheel, 
basically 
this figure here 
you control velocity 
angular velocity this simplified model 
good thing this fact 
that, you 
know what, this simplified model 
used design 
we a beautiful 
transformation relation basically 
between two models that we 
design v omega 
simplified model, we just, you 
know, put to differential 
rate model find vr vi to 
give to robots, right 
actually this week dr edgarsted 
you learned another even simpler model 
even a model a simpler thing 
called x dot equal to u 
basically where, 
you know, you dont even want to control 
lets 
say vel, linear velocity 
angular velocity 
instead you directly going to 
control, you know, x dot 
equal to u 
and, you learn this nice 
transformation that allows you 
to transform this x star equal to u 
directly to reason omegas 
right 
so, sudden you dont even 
to design controller based 
this model 
you design based this guy 
here 
you know, map back to v omega 
model, map that back 
to vr vm model, youre really 
good to go, excellent 
another thing that you learned in this 
weeks lecture carlike model 
you 
a current, you is there is you 
include this steering angle psi 
correlate model, you 
even map that model onto 
simplified model, simplified model 
onto whatever 
so so forth 
youre good to go 
so this math translates to motion 
basically is a dynamical model, 

we start robotics problem 
we 
start model so this is that 
is 
okay 
this is one 
excellent thing 
second thing that we learned in 
course systems, so that we know 
a model a, you know robot 
anything we want to control is 
described math 
we want to influence it, right 
we want to control 
we want to certain things 
so thats this whole idea systems 
comes in that 
okay, going to an input, 
going to an output 
going to actually describe 
system three matrices 
a, b c 
again, something that we went 
extensively in class 
system again, course, 
a 
robot, here a capera robot, here 
theres a humanoid 
robot 
anything you find a, b 
c matrices 
a matrix, remember 
is model, we discussed 
right now, 
right 
something thats given 
something thats physics 
basically device 
b matrix is actually something that we 
construct, that describes actuators 
basically, actuators this 
model 
this robot, in particular, that we 
control 
that information is encoded in b 
matrix 
c matrix course is, 
we measure 
whats 
output 
wha, sensors this robot 
we get output 
together, a, b c will make you 
make system 
yeah 
so thats awesome 
right 
this is extremely important 
you model you 
system you everything you 
need to cool things robot 
is precisely slide says 
we make robots basically anything 
well, anything 
you know, close enough 
and, in this lecture, sorry, in this 
course, 
basically we saw that, you know 
what, 
we model we create 

system model a, b c matrices, 
etcetera, 
then, we in fact make sure that 
system 
robot, with, you know, sensors, actuators, 
the, everything, 
blow up, end 
anything random 
stays stable 
we also this whole controllability, 
observability analysis, 
is important in order to make 
robot actually anything 
you even start talking 
controlling robot 
etcetera 
you need to know that, you know, is 
controllable, is 
observable, i in fact ability 
to things 
we this extensively in class 
another cool thing that we learned 
this whole 
automata, hybrid controls notion, you 
know, that you 
a robot to task you 
actually divide this task make 
small, small 
behaviors that robot 
kind 
mash behaviors together 
this automata thing 
also we learned that you 
this you know there undesirable 
things like zeno effect instance 
you get rid 
a lot things that we saw in 
this course, right 
is great though, that we 
this math 
so, end this course, you guys 
actually learned differential 
equations, linear algebra, geometry, a lot 
awesome tools that 
you make you, you know, actually 
nice stuff robots visually 
in software simulation 
you actually see happening 
you know, in front you 
is great 
track if you make 
robots anything 
two robots, humanoid robots 
in lab 
one guy is a cheer 
leading 
team one is a disco 
dancing routine 
this is emy laviers work a 
grad student george dake, in lab 
basically 
a command this entire thing 
based this course of, hybrid 
automators etcetera 
right in front you guys we 
actually making robots dance, is 
great, right 
and, you see amazing videos 
stuff about, you know, 
a lab robots 
gritslab youtube channel 

stuff, anyway this is us signing 
me, swati chopra robots behalf 
amy leviers 
good luck quiz seven rest 
lives 
bye, bye
