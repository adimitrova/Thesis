so, welcome to last lectures 
ive a great time, i hope youve 
learned quite a bit 
i want to this last lecture, 
is wrap things 
first thing i want to point 
is, really key things that i 
hoping to get this course, 
hoping that you would get 
course 
first is, learn in general to 
use control 
theory to make robots move around 
move move elegantly, 
safely effectively 
in order to this i want you to go 
home, if youre already home, stay home 
appreciate value systematic 
thinking design 
sure, you could hacked together 
we in this course 
you push beyond simple 
things, you really to theory 
right in order to work 
then, im hoping that you 
managed 
to bridge theorypractice gap 
actually 
lectures quizzes, 
also, going 
simulation experiments 
building robots 
if i could wish one thing, is 
that 
end this course, you dont 
stop robotisis 
you use this a stepping stone to go 
think abouut 
new exciting ways in you use 
robots program robots 
so fun, i want to spark 
investigations 
so, lets talk a little bit 
punchlines 
punchline is model 
ive using models this 
course 
point is that i love models 
you need 
a model in order to able to design 
control systems effectively 
because, if im going to able to say 
this 
robot is going to time, i need 
way 
predicting going to do, 
way 
i a prediction is if i a 
model 
reason we really need models 
is, well lets say you build a controller 
well way ensuring that 
controller is actually sound 
supposed to is to go 
back analyze controller 
interacts system 
system is modeled using model 
so thats we really, really, really 
need model 
now, we need model to rich enough 
to relevant 
meaning describe something 
thats going in real 
world, but, to simple enough to 
useful 
you dont to model everything 
you dont to worry friction 
unless youre 
trying to go really, really high speeds 
instance 
needs to simple enough, enough to 
useful, 
thats really key, i talked 
bananas versus nonbananas 
in sense that, there linear 
models there, linear systems 
there 
non bananas 
but, world is filled nonbananas, 
meaning nonlinear systems, yet 
time, 
linear model is rich enough to a 
lot things 
so keep bananas in mind, meaning make 
simple possible 
punchline is feedback 
we dont say, okay robot, drive 
two 
meters, make a left turn, drive 
four meters 
no, instead we measure robot is 
adjust 
control signal based robot 
is actually 
this is feedback 
feedback is so important to control 
theory 
in fact, important to life 
cells regulate enzymes to express 
based feedback 
without none us would here 
so, i want you always to think feedback 
there 
somethings that we talked 
designing feedback controllers 
stability is important thing 
if system aint stable wont work 
we talked things 
like tracking, you make follow a 
reference path 
robustness, we suppress noise, 
instance 
then, we actually design 
controllers 
well, key idea in control theory is 
state feedback 
we design controllers if we 
full state system 
we dont 
then, we use observers to actually 
estimate state 
and, thanks to this wonderful 
thing called separation principle, we 

design controllers if we 
states, design observers a 
way getting an estimate state 
so thats punchline number 
punchline number is architectures, you 
really 
to design different levels 
abstraction 
we talked three abstraction 
layers, 
thats quite standard you plan high 
level you want to go, you 
generates reference paths, in this 
case we that using linear models, 
you track using nonlinear 
models 
in particular, we looked 
differentialdrive robots 
now, this is because, we happened 
to like differentialdrive robots 
robots there 
either differentialdrive 
robots, approximated 
differential drive robots 
so this is a very, 
good way modeling actual 
nonlinear dynamics in a way 
thats simple enough to actually, able 
to say something 
fourth punchline, this is last 
punchline 
is whatever, dont listen to me, this 
field is done 
there is so much left to explore in 
wonderful world robotics 
so, i didnt cover here 
doesnt mean, important, 
also doesnt 
mean that we know already to 
so, i would like you to leave 
course thinking that, you know what, 
theres a whole 
world robotics there, that 
is 
to discover, to invent 
so field is certainly done yet 
that, i would like to say thank 
you 
ive really enjoyed i need 
to point five people that 
helped 
make this possible 
graduate students in lab 
greg droge showed up, segway 
man 
jp de la croix master 
ceremonies 
throughout course 
robotic experiments in studio 
hes also supporting simulator 
without 
him, this course would looked 
differently 
amy laviers smriti chopra 
providing glue lectures, 
combining 
connecting lectures to quizzes 
smriti also tirelessly answered 
questions on, forums 
last, rowland oflaherty 
working hardware aspect 
meaning, building robots 
showing you you actually build 
robot a relatively low cost 
last person, persons, 
that i need to thank is really you 
i dont know exactly you look like 
you are, sometimes i like 
to imagine you look like 
i feel that a lecture gone 
particularly well 
this is i hope, is 
people that happy 
people that learning robotics 
people that 
going in world, exploring 
discovering new things 
thank you
