1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,880
So, welcome to the last of the lectures.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,840
I've had a great time, I hope you've
learned quite a bit.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,330
What I want to do with this last lecture,
is just wrap things up.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,810
And the first thing I want to point out
is, what really are the key things that I

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,840
was hoping to get out of this course, or

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,960
was hoping that you would get out of the
course.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,890
The first is, just learn in general how to
use control

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,100
theory to make robots move around.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,980
And not just move but move elegantly, or
safely or effectively.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,790
And in order to do this I want you to go
home, if you're already home, stay home.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,940
And appreciate the value of systematic
thinking and design.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,690
Sure, you could have hacked together 60%
of what we did in this course.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,890
But once you push beyond simple

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,900
things, you really have to do the theory
right in order for it to work.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,230
And then, I'm hoping that some of you
managed

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,510
to bridge the theory-practice gap by
actually not only

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,080
doing the lectures and the quizzes, but
also, going

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,920
through the simulation and experiments and
building your own robots.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,224
And if I could wish for one thing, it is
that

20
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:16,960
at the end of this course, you don't just
stop being robot-Isis.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,620
You use this as a stepping stone to go out
and think abouut

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,480
new and exciting ways in which you can use
robots or program robots.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,320
So have fun, and I want it to spark
further investigations.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,360
So, let's talk a little bit about the
punchlines.

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,930
Punchline #1 is the model.

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,750
I've been using models all through this
course.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,130
And the point is not that I love models.

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,050
It's you need

29
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,716
a model in order to be able to design
control systems effectively.

30
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:48,530
Because, if I'm going to be able to say
what this

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,030
robot is going to do over time, I need
some way

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,660
of predicting what it's going to do, and
the only way

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,230
I can do a prediction is if I have a
model.

34
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,790
The other reason why we really need models
is, well let's say you build a controller.

35
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,140
Well the only way of ensuring that the
controller is actually sound and doing

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,790
what it's supposed to be doing is to go

37
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,680
back and analyze how the controller
interacts with the system.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,000
But the system is modeled using the model.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,410
So that's where we really, really, really
need the model.

40
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,010
Now, we need the model to be rich enough
to be relevant.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,500
Meaning it should describe something
that's going on in the real

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,380
world, but, it has to be simple enough to
be useful.

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,480
You don't have to model everything.

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,380
You don't have to worry about friction
unless you're

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,780
trying to go really, really high speeds
for instance.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,490
It needs to be simple enough, enough to be
useful,

47
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,280
and that's really key, and I talked about
bananas versus non-bananas.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,280
In the sense that, there are no linear

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,310
models out there, or linear systems out
there.

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,680
Non bananas.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,064
But, the world is filled with non-bananas,

52
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:57,790
meaning non-linear systems, yet at the
same time,

53
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,380
the linear model is rich enough to do a
lot of things.

54
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,600
So keep the bananas in mind, meaning make
it as simple as possible.

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,950
The other punchline is feedback.

56
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,550
We don't just say, okay robot, drive for
two

57
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,320
meters, make a left turn, and drive for
four meters.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,380
No, instead we measure what the robot is
doing and adjust

59
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,830
the control signal based on what the robot
is actually doing.

60
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,680
And this is feedback.

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,510
And feedback is so important to control
theory.

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,350
In fact, it's important to life.

63
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,280
Our cells regulate what enzymes to express
based on feedback.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,370
Without it none of us would be here.

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,600
So, I want you always to think feedback
and there

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,810
are somethings that we talked about when
we're designing feedback controllers.

67
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,040
Stability is the most important thing.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,760
If the system ain't stable it won't work.
Then we talked about things

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
like tracking, how do you make it follow a
reference path?

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,406
And robustness, how do we suppress noise,
for instance?

71
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:57,220
And then, how do we actually design
controllers?

72
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,630
Well, the key idea in control theory is
state feedback.

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,680
We design our controllers as if we had the
full state of the system.

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,970
Which we don't.

75
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,930
And then, we use observers to actually
estimate the state.

76
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,802
And, thanks to this wonderful

77
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,682
thing called the separation principle, we
can

78
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,986
design the controllers as if we had the

79
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:23,055
states, and then design our observers as a
way of getting an estimate of the state.

80
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,640
So that's punchline number 2.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,460
Punchline number 3 is architectures, you
really have

82
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,930
to do the design at different levels of
abstraction.

83
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,030
And we talked about three abstraction
layers,

84
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,960
that's quite standard where you plan high

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,860
level where you want to go, then you
generates reference paths, and in this

86
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,010
case we did that using linear models,

87
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,490
and then you track those using non-linear
models.

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,690
And in particular, we looked at
differential-drive robots.

89
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,920
Now, this is not because, we just happened
to like differential-drive robots.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,700
It's because the most robots out there are
either differential-drive

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,170
robots, or they can be approximated with
differential drive robots.

92
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,250
So this is a very,

93
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,560
very good way of modeling the actual
non-linear dynamics in a way

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,268
that's simple enough to actually, be able
to say something about it.

95
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:16,856
The fourth punchline, and this is the last
punchline -

96
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:22,060
is whatever, don't listen to me, this
field is not done.

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,070
There is so much left to explore in the
wonderful world of robotics.

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,530
So, just because I didn't cover it here it

99
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,230
doesn't mean, it's not important, or it
also doesn't

100
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,950
mean that we know already how to do it.

101
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,750
So, I would like you to leave the

102
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,160
course thinking that, you know what,
there's a whole

103
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,830
world of robotics out there, that not only
is

104
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,610
for me to discover, but for me to invent.

105
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,000
So the field is certainly not done yet.

106
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,700
And with that, I would like to say thank
you.

107
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,340
I've really enjoyed myself and I do need

108
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,630
to point out the five people that have
helped

109
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,190
make this possible.
Which are all graduate students in my lab.

110
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,270
Greg Droge showed up, he was the Segway
man.

111
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,110
JP de la Croix has been the master of
ceremonies

112
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,110
throughout the course doing all the
robotic experiments in the studio.

113
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,420
He's also been supporting the simulator
and without

114
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,320
him, this course would have looked very
differently.

115
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,730
Amy LaViers and Smriti Chopra have

116
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,430
been providing the glue lectures,
combining

117
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,120
or connecting the lectures to the quizzes

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
and Smriti has also tirelessly answered
all the questions on, on the forums.

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,520
And last, Rowland O'flaherty has been
working on the hardware aspect.

120
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,860
Meaning, building the robots.

121
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,330
Showing you how you can actually build
your own robot at a relatively low cost.

122
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,660
And then the last person, or persons,

123
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,420
that I need to thank is really all of you.

124
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,020
I don't know exactly what you look like or
where you are, but sometimes I like

125
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,900
to imagine what you look like and when

126
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,270
I feel that a lecture has gone
particularly well.

127
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,896
This is what I hope, it is.

128
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:56,710
People that are happy.

129
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,440
People that are learning robotics and
people that are

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,010
going out in the world, exploring and
discovering new things.

131
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,340
Thank you.
