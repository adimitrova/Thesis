we extremely close to end 
this entire course im actually done, 
believe not, technical 
part 
grand finale really this idea 
that we could even make complicated 
systems like cars act like unicycles that 
we know to control navigate 
around in complex environments weve 
seen in theory in simulation, 
actually in real experiments 
i want to in this sublecture is 
basically probe 
there lots things, believe 
not, that actually in this 
course, pretaining to control 
robots 
here i a picture a praying mantis 
reason that is that, we 
covered praying mantises 
so im going to let this a proxy 
things we havent talked 
well one thing that we havent talked 
is, happens system 
is generally nonlinear instead 
linear 
so we really, really good 
dealing linear control system 
well, if is linear, nonlinear 
well we dealt some, weve dealt 
unicycle quite a bit, there 
we kind lucky that we a lot 
intuition 
if this is unicycle if 
this is massively nonlinear, 
strange, complicated we 
actually well, thats called nominal 
control in this course i 
encourage you to keep educating 
probing along lines 
another thing that we didnt deal is 
is called optimal control 
so us, name game 
stability 
stability, performance in 
sense tracking, right, so we want 
to track reference signals, we 
robustness, we didnt have, 
explicitly, things like this 
so this is a general, type cost, 
saying, well we want to minimize 
cost involving x u 
this could be, you know, fuel 
consumed, time takes to get 
there, plus possibly cost 
final point well 
this is known optimal control, 
this also not, in course 
so this one grasshopper that we 
didnt see 
there is another branch decision 
theory known machine learning that we 
didnt touch upon 
reason i putting this a 
another thing that you might want to 
probe along is useful in 
robotics highly related to 
control in general optimal control in 
particular 
so idea is that 
im going to costs v im 
going to policy pie says 
you going to youre 
certain state 
cost is going to a cost 
different, i time k 
im time k 
so this is really u sub k, right 
im going to sum this entire cost 
if you that you write 
something known bellmans optimality 
equation bellmans equation, that 
basically characterizes is 
smallest you make this cost while 
satisfies this kind weird looking 
expression 
point here is math, 
point is that we this equation, 
machine learning is finding 
this v exploring 
if im this position, lets try 
u if im in another position, lets try 
u 
while this, youre building 
this a, this v cost function 
youre done building up, you 
sudden a complete map 
guide to you 
if you encounter a certain state, 
thats in a nutshell machine 
learning is 
another thing that we didnt much 
is perception mapping 
we infrared ultrasonic range 
sensors, a lot times 
we 
we laser scanners 
we cameras 
we deal complicated sensing 
modalities we also deal with, 
okay we sensor 
data 
we actually produce maps 
world world was, here is the, 
robot 
here is an obstacle 
a point 
lets avoid 
you know 
this obstacle may a point may 
part of, i dont know, a corridor, 
we would like to go in corridor 
well good to actually describe 
world looks like 
this is known mapping 
again, this is a perfect opportunity 
you to probe further, trying to build 
maps world 
there lots different methods 

finally, thing that we didnt 
either is really talk 
high level artificial intelligence 
so, you actually decide in 
first place you going 
we said, given a goal point, we go 
there goal coin, point 
come somehow, somewhere, someone is 
going to to make decisions 
highlevel robot 

this falls squarely domain 
artificial intelligence 
covered in this course, i encourage 
you to probe 
so, to conclude, there things that we 
havent done in this class 
there lots praying mantises that 
we didnt cover 
good things you to 
probe 
learn 
if you know it, you build an 
awesome robotic system 
but, beyond that, there also lots 
things we dont know 
so here, praying mantises, 
green creatures 
we idea look like 
we dont know if exist, we dont 
know 
robotics 
theres a lot stuff going that we 
a community dont know to yet 
so last thing i want to is give 
you impression that this is a closed 
complete case 
we know everything robotics 
we dont 
so, in this course there 
praying mantises, outside 
course there potential aliens that we 
still discovered
