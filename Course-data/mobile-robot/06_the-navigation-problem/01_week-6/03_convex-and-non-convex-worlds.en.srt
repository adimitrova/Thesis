1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,524
In the last lecture, we saw that we have 
really two choices when it comes to 

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:08,216
combining behaviors. 
We can either switch between them or we 

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,673
can blend them. 
And what I want to do in this lecture is 

4
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:16,717
really discuss a little bit further this 
issue of, of maybe not how we should 

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:22,872
combine them but if we need to introduce 
something more than just our dynamic duel 

6
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:27,202
of behaviors in order to deal with the 
navigation problem. 

7
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:32,302
And as a hinted act at the end of last 
lecture, was the induced mode, 

8
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,092
the sliding mode is somehow going to be 
important. 

9
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:39,972
But what I want to do today is start by 
discussing different kinds of worlds or 

10
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,347
environments. 
And I'm going to start simple with worlds 

11
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:47,052
where everything is a point, the 
obstacles are all points. 

12
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:52,002
And then, I'm going to start building up 
more and more complex scenarios to see 

13
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:56,796
when do we actually need to introduce 
another mode or another behavior in order 

14
00:00:56,796 --> 00:01:00,584
to be able to act well in the world. 
So, I'm going to start with points then 

15
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:04,844
I'm going to add a little bit of spatial 
dimension to these points so they're 

16
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:08,364
going to be circular obstacles. 
Then, we're going to generalize that to 

17
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:12,372
something called convex obstacles. 
we're going to make it harder than by 

18
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,395
making them nonconvex. 
And finally, we're going to look at 

19
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:18,300
labyrinths. 
So, basically the maze problem. If you're 

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,562
a, if you're a rat, 
a lab rat trying to get to the cheese, 

21
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:26,038
what kind of behaviors do you need to 
actually find, find the cheese? So, let's 

22
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:30,844
start like this and what I'm going to do 
now is basically discuss the different 

23
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:34,707
worlds at the rather high level by 
drawing cartoons of what's going on. 

24
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:38,853
And then, in the next lectures, we're 
going to be a little bit more precise 

25
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:41,992
about what's going on. 
But let's start with point worlds. 

26
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:45,148
As always, blue means the robot, here's 
the robot. 

27
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:50,011
Green means go and red means obstacle. 
And this little disk around the obstacle 

28
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:55,432
is simply me saying, this is the distance 
when it's unsafe to, to travel towards 

29
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:59,268
the obstacle and just switch, somehow, to 
avoiding obstacle. 

30
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:04,299
Either with a hard switch or a bland and 
in this case, it really doesn't matter 

31
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,775
too much which one we do. So, 
the robot, well, it's simply going to 

32
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:13,108
start [SOUND] so here is go to goal. 
Start moving towards the goal and then 

33
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,074
here, right? We're now hitting the, the 
bad region. 

34
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:19,755
Well, we know that the obstacle avoidance 
is going to push us away like this 

35
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:24,207
somehow so, you know, we do, we're going 
to do something like this and we got 

36
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:27,054
away. 
Let's say, there's a little epsilon disk 

37
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:30,263
around it. 
So, here's avoid obstacle and then, now, 

38
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:34,523
we're going to switch back and start 
[SOUND] going towards the goal. 

39
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:38,764
So, this seemed like a slam dunk, we did 
well somewhat at least. 

40
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:41,730
so, maybe we can declare successful point 
worlds. 

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,143
in fact, I want to show you another 
situation where I move the point a little 

42
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:51,262
bit. Now, [SOUND] I'm going towards the 
goal and here, 

43
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:55,577
go to goal, we want to move in this 
direction and avoid obstacle, you want to 

44
00:02:55,577 --> 00:03:00,177
move in exactly the same direction. 
So, what could potentially happen in this 

45
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:04,932
set up is when you answer here, the robot 
just keeps oscillating back and forth and 

46
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,562
it's never really finding a way around 
itself. 

47
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:12,456
There is a really, really, really 
unlikely scenario that could happen if 

48
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:17,554
you have this bilinear line up where 
everything is on the same line, where you 

49
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:21,924
just end up switching back and forth 
without really making, making any 

50
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,988
progress. 
Now, that is extremely unlikely when an 

51
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:29,460
actual robot is out in the world. 
That ain't going to happen because the 

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,106
world is always a little bit noisy, the 
sensors are always a little bit noisy and 

53
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:38,198
even the slightest amount of noise is 
going to push you out, away from this 

54
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,144
situation. 
So, the punch line, when we look at point 

55
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:45,614
worlds, is these two behaviors seem to be 
enough unless we're super unlucky. 

56
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:50,071
And I call this some kind of mild Zeno. 
basically you may end up trasitioning 

57
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:53,419
back and forth with no progress but like 
I said. 

58
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,002
in the real world, we're going to have 
noise, so points we don't really worry 

59
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,851
too much about. 
Well, let's go up in complexity. 

60
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,278
Let's look at circles. 
Well again, let me draw a cartoon on 

61
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,466
what's going on. 
Now, the red dot is big but I'm going 

62
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,331
towards the goal. 
[SOUND] Here, I'm going to start avoiding 

63
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,138
the goal and then let's say here, I'm 
going to start maybe, maybe I end up 

64
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:17,896
switching back and forth a couple times 
and then 

65
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:21,195
save. 
So, circular obstacles here seem pretty 

66
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,904
reasonable. 
it seems like our two behaviors are, are 

67
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:29,743
basically doing the same thing. 
Now, if the circular obstacle was moved 

68
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:34,873
down, again, so the center of mass of the 
obstacle was bilinear, on the same line 

69
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:40,367
as the goal and the robot, the again, we 
would get stuck in this highly unlikely, 

70
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:45,994
never-gonna-happen-in-real-life scenario. 
But basically, circular obstacles are 

71
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:51,302
point obstacles, just larger. 
But philosophically, and complexity-wise, 

72
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:55,278
we can deal with them. 
Now, the next level up in complexity is 

73
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,978
convexity versus non-convexity. 
So, on the left here, you see what's 

74
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:05,186
called a convex obstacle. 
It's basically a, it looks like a circle 

75
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,606
or a disk that's being squished a little 
bit. 

76
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:14,151
what makes it convex is that if I take 
any two points inside this obstacle and I 

77
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:19,518
draw a line in between them, that line 
lays entirely inside the obstacles, 

78
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,669
right? 
If I take the right obstacle, which is in 

79
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,970
fact, not convex then, you know what, if 
I take two points, we'll find this line 

80
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,888
lies entirely with in the obstacle. 
But if I take a point here and a point 

81
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:37,132
there, then this line actually falls 
outside of the obstacle. 

82
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:41,965
So, an obstacle or a set is convex if 
every line in between two points in the 

83
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:47,027
set lies entirely inside that set itself. 
So, we're going to start with convex 

84
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:51,937
obstacles as the first step up from 
circles or disks and then we're going to 

85
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:56,568
look at non obstacles. 
So, I have a nonconvex obstacle, right? 

86
00:05:56,568 --> 00:06:01,964
It's not a circle anymore and what I have 
here is, well, now my red marker doesn't 

87
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:07,648
show up, but any line I can draw here, of 
course, is entirely within this this 

88
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:10,490
disk. 
So, let's see what's happening here. 

89
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,770
the robot starts moving. 
[SOUND] A straight line. 

90
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,061
And then here gets, let's say that they, 
they now want to starts avoiding the 

91
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:26,601
obstacles so maybe avoid obstacle is 
going to push it there, it may be pushed 

92
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,342
back. 
What's going to happen is there is a 

93
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:34,597
point when avoid obstacle is going to 
point straight away from go to goal and 

94
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:40,200
now and we've ended up in this situation 
that was super unlucky and unlikely when 

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,616
we had a point. 
But in the convex with noncircular 

96
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:49,007
obstacle situation, that situation is no 
longer super unlucky because we ended up 

97
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,518
in it. 
Let me again point out what's happening 

98
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,864
is that we're getting here, 
let's say, here is actually the point 

99
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:57,647
where avoid obstacle wants to go in this 
direction, 

100
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:01,859
go to goal wants to go in this direction 
and by switching, we're ending up there, 

101
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:05,679
which is the unlucky point, but in this 
case, it's actually not unlucky. 

102
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:09,695
So, these two behaviors themselves, 
no matter, no matter if we blend them or 

103
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,935
switch between them, we actually get 
stuck. 

104
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,522
So, we need someway of you know what, 
getting around the obstacle and somehow 

105
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:23,533
we need to follow the boundary of this 
obstacle and not just switch back 

106
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:27,787
absent-mindedly between going into goal 
and avoiding obstacles. 

107
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:32,972
So, here is a situation where we clearly 
need to introduce another behavior in 

108
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,717
order to be able to navigate this 
obstacle. 

109
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:40,907
Well, if you have a nonconvex obstacle, 
this is known as a robotic flytrap. 

110
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:44,102
what it is, it's, it's a nonconvex 
obstacle. 

111
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:47,977
It's a cul-de-sac. 
And you know what, this robot is going to 

112
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:50,700
get down here. 
First of all, it's going to get stuck 

113
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,615
here right, right, because here, we have 
this go to goal and avoid obstacle 

114
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:59,111
pointing in different directions but even 
if we were able to continue here, well, 

115
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:03,076
now all of a sudden, we're going away 
from the obstacle and, no, sorry, from 

116
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:06,180
the goal. 
Clearly, we need something more than just 

117
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,844
go to goal and avoid obstacles to do 
this. 

118
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:13,955
we need some clever way not only of 
following the boundary of this obstacle 

119
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:18,661
but following it in such a way that we 
actually progress towards the goal 

120
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:23,580
globally even though we're locally in the 
short run and getting further away. 

121
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,340
So, nonconvex obstacles, 
it's even worse than convex obstacles. 

122
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,452
Two, two behaviors certainly aren't going 
to work. 

123
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:33,088
Well, what if you have a labyrinth? 
So this is, you know, you have a bunch of 

124
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,633
different things. 
You may have something extra here. 

125
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,304
You may have something here. 
You have a bunch of things. 

126
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:42,162
And the robot needs to figure out that 
it's supposed to do this, right? Which., 

127
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,957
I mean, 
[SOUND] now I'm going to sound, try to 

128
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:50,159
sound like I'm from New Jersey, forget 
about it. That was probably not so close 

129
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,228
with my Swedish accent. 
But anyway, it ain't going to happen with 

130
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:58,081
just two behaviors. 
Clearly, no way of dealing with that with 

131
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:03,167
only avoid obstacle and go to goal so 
what we need is really at least one more 

132
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,759
behavior that allows us to deal with 
worlds that aren't just circular 

133
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,401
obstacles or point obstacles. 
That are, in fact, convex or nonconvex or 

134
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:16,846
even, you know, labyrinths. 
We want to be able to solve this problem, 

135
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,958
we want our robotic rat to get the, the 
cheese. 

136
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,626
And that is going to be the topic of the 
next lecture.
