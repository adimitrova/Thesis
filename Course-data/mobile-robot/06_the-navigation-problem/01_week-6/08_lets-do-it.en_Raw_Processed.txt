so this work that weve gone 
through, weve seen to design control 
systems, weve seen to take different 
controllers put together in a 
hybrid navigation architecture 
weve seen to deal practical 
issues, like fact that obstacles 
indeed, points, that never 
going to able to measure exactly 
we are, so we need to factify guards 
we tweaked parameters 
actually ready to real 
so presentation, slide part 
this lecture is short 
this 
enough talk 
lets 
so now, we indeed ready to, see 
hard work pay deploying these, 
rather elegant algorithms that weve 
developed actual robots 
always, im here with, j 
p 
delacroixg, we going to, take 
old friend, computer, 
differential drive mobile robot, 
a series 
obstacle courses obstacles 
become become complicated 
you see, first set is a 
convexg obstacle 
we saw in lecture that in theory, 
robot actually get stuck in one 
local minimum goal to 
goal obstacle avoidance behaviors 
will cancel 
in practice, an obstacle this 
size, that aint going to happen 
world is indeed a noisy place 

noise will always kick robot 
particular local minima 
so, going to see first is 
goaltogoal avoid obstacles 
together that enough to 
robot navigate this single convex 
obstacle 
so we see robot starts in a 
gotogoal behavior 
approaches obstacle, there, 
infrared sensors picks 
obstacle, robot successfully 
navigates around 

safe to go back to gotogoal, 
we see, robot successfully 
managed to navigate this particularly 
simple environment two 
behaviors 
so now, lets take two favorite 
behaviors, gotogoal avoid obstacle, 
set to fail 
we saw in lectures, theres really 
way two behaviors to 
successfully negotiate a 
nonconvex, obstacle 
in this case we a culdesac that we 
will try to get around using onlt 
two behaviors, we not, to 
completely honet, honest, expecting this 
to go that well 
so, robot starts in a go togo 
mode is entering culdesac, 
going to start avoiding 
obstacles here, doesnt quite know 
to go, 
pulled away, goal to goal is 
pulling forward poor robot is 
completely confused really 
punching way this cul da sac 
two behaviors 
we see end result is 
somewhat disastrous 
so that rather depressing 
poor robot stuck in cul de 
sac without really anywhere to go 
obstacle avoidance going to go 
kept pulling in different directions 
ended a mild disaster 
we seen in lectures that 
way around this problem is really to 
introduce a third behavior, induced mode 
followwall, will allow robot 
to purposefully make way 
culdesac a clear shot to 
goal, sufficient forward 
progress made followwall will 
released gotogoal will 
take 
so jp, lets see grand finale here, 
full blown hybrid navigation 
architecture in 
action 
robot starts out, again, in a 
gotogoal mode, enters culdesac, 
whats going to different now, is 
obstacle avoidance is going to 
replaced a followwall, robot 
purposefully makes way 
culdesac along one obstacle arms 
and, you see 
problems we 
confusion 
pulled back forth between 
different behaviors, is longer 
there 
robot successfully navigated 
around obstruction 
is back goal to goal 
behavior
