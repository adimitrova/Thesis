in last lecture, we saw that we 
really two choices comes to 
combining behaviors 
we either switch between we 
blend 
i want to in this lecture is 
really discuss a little bit this 
issue of, maybe we 
combine if we need to introduce 
something dynamic duel 
behaviors in order to deal 
navigation problem 
a hinted act end last 
lecture, induced mode, 
sliding mode is somehow going to 
important 
i want to today is start 
discussing different kinds worlds 
environments 
im going to start simple worlds 
everything is a point, 
obstacles points 
then, im going to start building 
complex scenarios to see 
we actually need to introduce 
another mode another behavior in order 
to able to act well in world 
so, im going to start points 
im going to add a little bit spatial 
dimension to points so theyre 
going to circular obstacles 
then, going to generalize that to 
something called convex obstacles 
going to make harder 
making nonconvex 
finally, going to look 
labyrinths 
so, basically maze problem if youre 
a, if youre a rat, 
a lab rat trying to get to cheese, 
kind behaviors you need to 
actually find, find cheese so, lets 
start like this im going to 
is basically discuss different 
worlds rather high level 
drawing cartoons whats going 
then, in next lectures, 
going to a little bit precise 
whats going 
lets start point worlds 
always, blue means robot, heres 
robot 
green means go red means obstacle 
this little disk around obstacle 
is simply saying, this is distance 
unsafe to, to travel towards 
obstacle switch, somehow, to 
avoiding obstacle 
either a hard switch a bland 
in this case, really doesnt matter 
much one we so, 
robot, well, simply going to 
start sound so here is go to goal 
start moving towards goal 
here, right hitting the, 
bad region 
well, we know that obstacle avoidance 
is going to push us away like this 
somehow so, you know, we do, going 
to something like this we got 
away 
lets say, theres a little epsilon disk 
around 
so, heres avoid obstacle then, now, 
going to switch back start 
sound going towards goal 
so, this seemed like a slam dunk, we 
well somewhat least 
so, maybe we declare successful point 
worlds 
in fact, i want to show you another 
situation i move point a little 
bit now, sound im going towards 
goal here, 
go to goal, we want to move in this 
direction avoid obstacle, you want to 
move in exactly direction 
so, could potentially happen in this 
set is you answer here, robot 
keeps oscillating back forth 
never really finding a way around 

there is a really, really, really 
unlikely scenario that could happen if 
you this bilinear line 
everything is line, you 
end switching back forth 
without really making, making 
progress 
now, that is extremely unlikely an 
actual robot is in world 
that aint going to happen 
world is always a little bit noisy, 
sensors always a little bit noisy 
even slightest amount noise is 
going to push you out, away this 
situation 
so, punch line, we look point 
worlds, is two behaviors seem to 
enough unless super unlucky 
i call this kind mild zeno 
basically you may end trasitioning 
back forth progress like 
i said 
in real world, going to 
noise, so points we dont really worry 
much 
well, lets go in complexity 
lets look circles 
well again, let draw a cartoon 
whats going 
now, red dot is big im going 
towards goal 
sound here, im going to start avoiding 
goal lets say here, im 
going to start maybe, maybe i end 
switching back forth a couple times 

save 
so, circular obstacles here seem pretty 
reasonable 
seems like two behaviors are, 
basically thing 
now, if circular obstacle moved 
down, again, so center mass 
obstacle bilinear, line 
goal robot, again, we 
would get stuck in this highly unlikely, 
nevergonnahappeninreallife scenario 
basically, circular obstacles 
point obstacles, larger 
philosophically, complexitywise, 
we deal 
now, next level in complexity is 
convexity versus nonconvexity 
so, left here, you see whats 
called a convex obstacle 
basically a, looks like a circle 
a disk thats squished a little 
bit 
makes convex is that if i take 
two points inside this obstacle i 
draw a line in between them, that line 
lays entirely inside obstacles, 
right 
if i take right obstacle, is in 
fact, convex then, you know what, if 
i take two points, well find this line 
lies entirely in obstacle 
if i take a point here a point 
there, this line actually falls 
outside obstacle 
so, an obstacle a set is convex if 
every line in between two points in 
set lies entirely inside that set 
so, going to start convex 
obstacles first step 
circles disks going to 
look non obstacles 
so, i a nonconvex obstacle, right 
a circle anymore i 
here is, well, red marker doesnt 
show up, line i draw here, 
course, is entirely within this this 
disk 
so, lets see whats happening here 
robot starts moving 
sound a straight line 
here gets, lets say that they, 
want to starts avoiding 
obstacles so maybe avoid obstacle is 
going to push there, may pushed 
back 
whats going to happen is there is a 
point avoid obstacle is going to 
point straight away go to goal 
weve ended in this situation 
that super unlucky unlikely 
we a point 
in convex noncircular 
obstacle situation, that situation is 
longer super unlucky we ended 
in 
let point whats happening 
is that getting here, 
lets say, here is actually point 
avoid obstacle wants to go in this 
direction, 
go to goal wants to go in this direction 
switching, ending there, 
is unlucky point, in this 
case, actually unlucky 
so, two behaviors themselves, 
matter, matter if we blend 
switch between them, we actually get 
stuck 
so, we need someway you know what, 
getting around obstacle somehow 
we need to follow boundary this 
obstacle switch back 
absentmindedly between going goal 
avoiding obstacles 
so, here is a situation we clearly 
need to introduce another behavior in 
order to able to navigate this 
obstacle 
well, if you a nonconvex obstacle, 
this is known a robotic flytrap 
is, its, a nonconvex 
obstacle 
a culdesac 
you know what, this robot is going to 
get here 
first all, going to get stuck 
here right, right, here, we 
this go to goal avoid obstacle 
pointing in different directions even 
if we able to continue here, well, 
a sudden, going away 
obstacle and, no, sorry, 
goal 
clearly, we need something 
go to goal avoid obstacles to 
this 
we need clever way 
following boundary this obstacle 
following in a way that we 
actually progress towards goal 
globally even though locally in 
short run getting away 
so, nonconvex obstacles, 
even worse convex obstacles 
two, two behaviors certainly arent going 
to work 
well, if you a labyrinth 
so this is, you know, you a bunch 
different things 
you may something extra here 
you may something here 
you a bunch things 
robot needs to figure that 
supposed to this, right which, 
i mean, 
sound im going to sound, try to 
sound like im new jersey, forget 
that probably so close 
swedish accent 
anyway, aint going to happen 
two behaviors 
clearly, way dealing that 
avoid obstacle go to goal so 
we need is really least one 
behavior that allows us to deal 
worlds that arent circular 
obstacles point obstacles 
that are, in fact, convex nonconvex 
even, you know, labyrinths 
we want to able to solve this problem, 
we want robotic rat to get the, 
cheese 
that is going to topic 
next lecture
