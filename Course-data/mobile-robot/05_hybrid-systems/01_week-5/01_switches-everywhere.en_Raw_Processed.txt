so welcome to module course, 
control mobile robots 
so far first modules kind 
introductions to topic 
previous modules went rather 
deeply issue of, control 
sign linear time in variant systems 
we ended last module a high 
note 
showed that we could rather 
remarkable things, like make a humanoid 
robot wave in, exciting ways 
using, control linear time in variant 
systems 
now, unfortunately, world isnt that 
easy 
especially, robotic world is 
that easy 
so this entire module is devoted to 
we take module 
make cope realities 
world in robots embedded 
in module , actually going to 
go full force robotics, 
this module thought 
glue module between linear systems 
actual robotics 
in fact, title this lecture 
is, switches everywhere, so far 
modules, models 
time, in fact, 
models same, we design a size 
fits type controller 
way weve kind messed 
controllers, is changing the, the, 
reference values to desired angles 

this humanoid robot, desired 
velocities angular velocities 
segue robot 
but, certainly always true that 
models never change in real 
world 
and, this is never true in robotics, 
unfortunately 
in fact, if you recall, we talked 
in module 
we talked something called behavior 
based control 
robot switches between 
different modes operation, 
behaviors, in response to world 
throws you 
you see an obstacle, you switch to avoid 
that obstacle 
if you, need to go recharge you switch to 
a, lets look outlets behavior 
so we need to is somehow come to 
grips, terms this reality 
that is going to start this 
module 
first thing to note is that in 
world there switches everywhere 
so here, left, is a bipedal 
walking robot 
well, bipedal walking robots a leg 
thats swinging, one dynamics, 
bam, ro, leg is 
ground, dynamics changed 
so fact that dynamics 
changes 
depending whether youre in 
swing face, stance face 
dynamics is different 
here, i drew a cartoon a bouncing 
ball 
well, modes 
in air, sound 
bounces 
something new happens 
b, ball gets squished, 
releases 
so, there 
we switches 
i actually included this wonderful 
picture locusts i 
actually worked locusts 
locusts dont bother anyone 
whats called a solitary mode 
something happens 
switch to a gregarious mode 
lump together devastate harvests 
everywhere 
this is a transition that occurs 
a lack food, instance 
in the, cases, 
naturally occurring switches that 
models to take account 
now, a robotics point view, 
may slightly relevant to look 
switches design instead 
necessity 
so here is a gear box to a car 
switching between different gears 
we want car to run 
smoothly different rpms 
so switching dynamics 
we to 
better 
here, this is a, a cockpit 
supposed to representing an 
autopilot an aircraft youre 
switching between cruise climb turn land 
takeoff modes 
so, instead designing controller 
that takes atlanta, georgia to 
stockholm, sweden 
you a bunch different controllers 
that youre switching in order to 
this 
bottom here, we a sensor 
network 
where, in order to preserve power, youre 
turning sensors purpose 
so, youre switching design, rather 
necessity 
and, in robotics 
everywhere switches design 
this is south driving georgia tech 
car that switches between different 
behaviors depending whats happening 
in world 
heres a mobile robot that switches 
between behaviors depending not, 
whether there obstacles, i 
wish we worked snake robotics 
switching between different modes, 
depending is going in 
environment 
this is a friend in now, this is 
sensor network, this is aerial 
robot that weve seen, going to 
see 
in cases, going to 
to switch in order to respond to 
world throws way 
now, there issues that we need 
to deal 
issue number one is really we 
model switches we model 
systems that arent staying 
time 
well, question then, course, 
is if models change, 
stability performance 
we go old methods to try to 
understand this well, this boils 
to fact, that go to 
infinity, within a single mode 
meaning you staying in mode 
forever, stability is defined 
happens goes to infinity, 
go to infinity in in, 
individual mode 
so, we somewhat need to understand that 
we also issues compositionality 
this is fancy speak saying, if i 
multiple modes multiple controllers, 
i put together is 
way in fit together like lego 
pieces in a big lego drawing 
and, importantly, there traps 
there issues that arise 
switches that we dont fully know 
to deal 
now, this module will deal 
this, 
in next lecture, going to 
start first question is, 
we really model hybrid switched 
systems in a systematic coherent way
