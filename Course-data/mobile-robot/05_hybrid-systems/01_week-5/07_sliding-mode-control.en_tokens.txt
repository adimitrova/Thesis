last
time
we
saw
that
not
only
we
have
to
worry
about
zeno
.
this
zeno
problem
or
the
zeno
phenomenon
comes
in
two
different
flavors
.
and
one
thing
that
i
stated
was
that
type
1
zeno
which
is
infinitely
many
switches
in
zero
time
or
in
one
timing
sense
here
represented
by
this
system
where
.
again
,
if
i
have
x
here
,
and
time
here
,
and
i
start
positive
,
then
x
is
going
to
be
-1
until
x
becomes
,
just
,
just
negative
.
and
then
,
we
're
going
to
get
this
infinitely
many
switches
going
on
right
there
.
that
's
type
1.
well
,
it
turns
out
,
that
we
can
actually
remedy
this
.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
,
you
know
what
is
very
,
very
clear
what
should
happen
.
the
system
should
n't
grind
to
a
halt
.
it
should
just
nicely
keep
continuing
on
like
this
like
x
is
equal
to
0.
so
how
do
i
take
this
intuitive
notion
of
that
x
should
just
keep
saying
and
be
equal
to
0
and
make
that
mathematically
sound
.
what
,
what
's
the
topic
of
today
's
lecture
,
and
this
construction
by
which
we
can
continue
beyond
the
zeno
point
in
the
type
1
zeno
system
,
using
something
that
's
known
as
.
sliding
mode
control
.
so
,
let
's
be
a
little
bit
general
here
.
let
's
say
that
i
have
one
system
,
x
dot
is
f1
(
x
)
and
then
i
have
a
switching
surface
,
g
(
x
)
.
and
when
g
is
negative
,
i
switch
to
f
two
,
and
when
it
becomes
positive
i
switch
back
to
f1
.
so
here
it
is
,
here
's
my
switching
surface
,
g
(
x
)
=
0
,
that
's
where
the
action
is
.
now
on
this
side
i
'm
going
to
be
using
f1
,
and
da
,
da
,
da
,
da
,
da
,
da
,
da
,
when
i
hit
this
point
,
well
let
's
say
that
f1
is
pointing
inwards
.
well
on
this
part
of
the
world
i
am
going
to
be
using
f2
.
well
,
let
's
say
that
f2
here
points
outwards
.
this
means
that
when
i
hit
this
point
again
,
i
grind
to
a
halt
.
so
this
is
really
what
's
going
on
is
that
both
of
the
vector
fields
both
f1
and
f2
point
in
the
wrong
direction
.
so
f1
points
over
in
to
the
f2
territory
.
f2
points
over
in
the
f1
territory
,
but
again
it
's
clear
what
should
really
happen
.
we
should
somehow
slide
along
the
switching
surface
here
.
that
's
clear
because
f1
and
f2
are
pulling
in
different
directions
and
this
is
why
it
's
known
as
sliding
mode
control
because
what
we
do
is
we
slide
along
the
switching
surface
.
so
let
's
see
how
to
actually
make
this
sliding
happen
.
again
,
i
have
g
positive
on
this
side
,
g
negative
on
this
side
,
and
the
switching
surface
is
g
=
0.
f2
wants
to
drive
me
in
this
direction
,
and
f1
wants
to
drive
me
in
this
direction
.
i
want
to
slide
along
the
surface
.
that
should
be
the
right
solution
.
well
first
of
all
what
are
the
conditions
under
which
i
'm
going
to
slide
.
well
f2
needs
to
point
in
the
positive
direction
of
g
because
on
this
side
g
is
positive
.
so
what
i
'm
going
to
do
is
i
'm
going
to
find
this
thing
,
the
vector
that
's
normal
to
the
switching
surface
and
it
turns
out
that
luckily
for
us
this
is
the
gradient
.
the
partial
derivative
of
g
with
respect
to
x
,
transpose
.
and
now
i
take
what
's
called
the
inner
product
,
so
,
with
this
thing
and
this
thing
.
so
the
inner
product
is
just
a
multiplication
.
and
if
this
inner
product
is
positive
,
it
means
that
this
one
and
this
one
are
pointing
.
in
the
same
direction
.
i
also
take
the
inter-product
with
this
and
that
,
and
if
the
inter-product
is
negative
,
it
means
that
they
're
pointing
in
,
in
different
directions
.
so
what
this
means
is
i
actually
have
a
condition
for
sliding
.
i
need
dg
the
x
,
where
this
is
actually
dg
,
dx1
,
blah
,
blah
,
blah
,
blah
,
blah
,
dg
,
the
xn
a
roll
vector
like
this
times
f1
,
well
f11
to
f1n
,
'cause
these
are
all
vectors
.
if
this
is
negative
,
that
is
code
for
having
this
arrow
and
this
arrow
pointing
in
different
directions
.
so
,
f1
points
into
negative
g
territory
.
f2
points
into
positive
g
territory
.
if
this
happens
at
the
switching
surface
,
then
we
have
sliding
.
and
,
one
way
we
can
think
about
this
object
here
,
it
's
the
derivative
of
g
,
in
the
direction
f1
.
and
this
is
the
derivative
of
g
in
the
direction
f2
,
and
there
's
actually
a
fancy
term
for
this
.
it
's
called
the
lie
derivative
.
so
the
derivative
of
g
in
the
direction
f
,
we
're
going
to
write
this
lfg
which
is
simply
code
for
dg/dx
*
f.
so
when
i
write
lfg
,
this
is
what
i
mean
.
it
's
the
lead
derivative
of
g
in
the
direction
of
f.
so
,
using
our
slightly
fancier
notation
we
know
that
sliding
occurs
.
meaning
we
should
slide
if
the
derivative
,
g
,
in
the
f1
direction
is
negative
,
which
,
again
,
means
this
and
this
have
different
directions
,
and
the
derivative
of
g
in
the
f2
direction
is
positive
,
which
means
this
and
this
have
the
same
signs
meaning
they
point
in
the
same
,
in
the
same
directions
.
so
this
actually
tells
us
whether
or
not
we
have
sliding
and
wallah
,
we
actually
have
a
test
for
type
1
zeno
that
says
that
sliding
occurs
.
if
lf1g
is
negative
and
lf2g
is
positive
,
and
this
is
at
g
(
x
)
=
0
so
this
is
along
the
switching
surface
when
we
're
inside
the
different
mode
regime
.
we
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
this
.
but
on
the
switching
surface
,
this
our
zeno
type
1
probe
that
we
have
to
use
to
see
whether
or
not
we
slide
.
and
this
nice
because
this
is
something
that
's
easily
implemented
.
we
still
do
n't
know
what
actually
happens
beyond
the
zeno
point
,
meaning
,
how
do
we
slide
.
and
that
is
going
to
be
the
topic
of
next
lecture
.
