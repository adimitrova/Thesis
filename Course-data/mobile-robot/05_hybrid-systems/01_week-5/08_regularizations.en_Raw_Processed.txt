so last time we saw that we could 
actually test type zeno way 
we could test this to see whether 
gradient dg, dx transpose points 
in direction f, in 
opposite direction f 
so if i that, i type 
zeno 
we came a little probe here 
to check whether not, this is indeed 
happening 
so, first thing we is we check 
lfg negative, lf 
g positive 
lfg this thing we called 
lead derivative 
simply fancy speak dg, 
dx times, in this case, f x 
thats means 
so this is probe that checks whether 
sliding occurs 
today, i want to talk whats called 
regularizations, is 
code okay, lets say we that, we 
sliding, we compute we 
slide turns that this is 
going to important we move 
to robotics this occurs quite 
a bit you actually start running 
robotic navigation systems 
so todays lecture is to 
actually slide along this surfacewell, 
lets actually try to a little careful 
in unknown 
so if im sliding here, is 
characterizing that motion well, i know 
that gx means that if i take 
time, relative g, we respect 
to g is 
going to change im sliding 
im staying g 
so one thing we need to is say that 
dgdt 
well, lets see that takes us, 
dgdt is equal to dgdxxdot 
so is x dot along here 
well, i going to postulate is 
that a combination f f 
in fact lets say that is equal to 
sigmafsigmaf 
so a convex combination of, 
two vector fields 
so if i that, i get instead x dots, 
i get this thing here sigma f plus 
sigma f 
well, since scalars, i 
actually pull here, means 
that i write this expression thats 
is a little bit messy looking like sigma 
times lead derivative g along f 
plus sigma times lead derivative 
g along f 
so thats time derivative g 
actually is 
i want that to equal to 
this needs to equal to that 
condition 
so if i put this thing equal i 
solve instance sigma i get 
this expression right here 
so i know is going to depend 
well thats a good start 
we also know that need to 
positive im allowed to 
always start flowing backwards 
also sum to otherwise 
go super fast along this 
direction i typically dont want 
i want to respect dynamics 
so 
i additional constraint 
so sigma needs to positive 
need to sum to 
well 
lets see we actually solve 
so, lets go back to old friend, 
example 
this example 
looks like this, where, you know 
im sliding slope 
heres x heres time 
i hit switching surface, i 
stay x duration 
okay, is switching surface, 
first well, x, so gx is 
simply x 
okay, 
lets compute lee 
derivatives 
so, lfg 
its, derivative g, 
respect to x 
so, derivative that respect 
to x, is simply 
f is simply negative 
so, lee derivative is negative 
is things we needed 
zeno 
we needed, sliding 
we needed this to negative for, type 
zeno to occur 
thats first 
well lets f 
sorry this is an f right here, 
apologize that 
l f g well a dgdx equals 
derivative that respect to x 
is , f is plus 
right, so i get , is equal to , 
is positive, 
condition type zeno 
so we know that we actually type 
zeno, sliding, here 
okay 
so now, lets try figuring 
sigmas actually 
well, we a formula sigma 
is equal to sigma two lee 
derivatives divided eachother 
well, this this so 
sigma is simple equal to sigma 
rather simple 
inaudible 
what, well, recall 
that need to sum to 
means that to a 
half 
this actually means, then, is that 
we compute induced mode, 
sliding mode, actually is 
well, i take sigma f, is half 
f 
i take sigma times f is 
half f, well f is negative one 
f is plus one so i get 
thats equal to 
so i know that induced mode, in this 
case, is x dot , is exactly 
we wanted 
remember this picture that weve 
drawn 
we want to start here, get there, 
keep staying 
math turns to work out, in 
this case 
now, lets find induced mode in 
general 
i know that general formula 
sigma i, i want to point that 
this is a formula one in 
right mind memorize, we 
know comes able to 
use we need to 
but, here is general formula the, 
induced mode 
well, we also that sigma plus 
sigma , is equals to , means that 
i take sigma here, plug in, 
this is sigma is 
so i an expression sigma so 
if i solve that, i acutally know 
sigma is 
i encourage you to go math 
yourself, a little bit a mouth 
full, its, tells is 
that i compute sigma , i compute 
sigma , well 
and, if i sum this 
together, i get this expression inside 
pink box there 
i recognize again, this is a little 
bit a mouthful, this tells 
is exactly induced mode is 
so i going to put a sweet heart around 
this thing, particularly 
pretty systematic 
tell us to actually find sliding 
mode controller induced mode 
means that we know exactly, 
type zeno occurs 
to progress beyond 
so, lets figure 
if i have, this is hybrid system 
and, if this is a type zeno hybrid 
automaton 
i regularize i to 
add this extra sliding mode well, this 
is i 
now, lets parse this, even though 
looks a little bit like a mouthful, lets 
figure means 
so lets say im here, g is positive 
g is positive is, is well 
then, if g becomes sliding 
condition is satisfied 
i move in to we computed 
here is induce mode 
a little bit a mouth 
full we will see later that in 
robotics we choice to 
actually use this 
so im going to use this mode until 
if g becomes positive i jump back to f 
if g becomes negative i jump to f 
course we dont always type 
zeno switches nice if i simply 
end g negative, i jump directly 
mode to mode vice versa 
so, this is you take a hybrid system 
make immune to nauseous 
bad effects type zeno 
nice thing is that this is 
completely general, we dont ever 
to worry zeno 
type zeno, type zeno we already said 

said that this actually brings 
to summary this entire model 
hybrid systems 
so, we have, we models, we 
rich models 
hybrid unknown models 
we something we call stability 
awareness aware fact 
that, submodules, 
submodes stable doesnt 
mean that hybrid system is stable 
we need to aware it, test 

we also seen zeno another awkward 
hybridization that occurs 
an awkward phenomenon that occur 
you go hybrid 
we classes zeno 
, is type , is bouncing 
ball 
infinitely many switch, many switches in 
finite, not, zero time 
thats bad scary, we cant 
anything except, look 

then, we type 
we know, to check 

to get around using 
things that i call regularizations 
induced sliding mode that if i 
had, you know a confetti, i would toss 
air this ends 
massive part prerobotics part 
really this course 
so going to in next 
module is go back to robotics 
apply, new awesome tools, 
see, we unleash to 
actually make mobile ro, robots cool 
things in real world 
well done
