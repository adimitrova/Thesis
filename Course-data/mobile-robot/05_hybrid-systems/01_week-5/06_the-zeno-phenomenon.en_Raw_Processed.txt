so, in last lecture, we investigated 
this innocentlooking model system, 
a ball bouncing a surface 
we saw something rather strange 
there, that, that the, ball 
ended bouncing an infinite number 
times in finite time 
this is part another potential 
complication that comes hyberdizing 
model, namely, that you 
kinds infinitely many swicthes 
this is known zeno phenomenon 
in todays lecture, going to 
dig a little deeper the, zeno 
phenomenon see we 
if you understand 
fundamentally, i would like to 
point is that zeno is bad, if 
youre actually running something thats 
asked to an infinite amount things 
in finite time, crashes 
if youre running this computer, 
simulations crash 
another thing is that we know that there 
is something inaccurate wrong 
model ball, if i drop a ball, 
doesnt bounce an infinite number 
times, 
bounces times stops 
bouncing 
so, theres something wrong 
model 
thats another warning flag 
third warning flag is that we 
dont actually know system 
beyond the, zeno point, meaning 
time to we an infinite 
number switches 
so, since we cant really define 
system is beyond that point, things 
like asymptotic stability is meaningless 
time is allowed to really 
progress to infinity 
so, first all, is called 
zeno phenomenon well, there a greek 
philosopher, zeno, zeno elea spent 
a lot time thinking movement 
dynamic world basically point 
that perception world is 
wrong clearly there 
problems there instance, heres 
one famous paradoxes 
we a hare racing a tortoise 
tortoise is a little slower so 
tortoise gets a head start 
in fact, tortoise starts there 
then, race is 
point, hare reaches 
point tortoise started 
that point, right, tortoise 
moved, much moved a little 
bit 
this is far tortoise moved 
okay race goes 
point, hare catches to 
tortoise last time now, 
tortoise moved a little bit more, 
much, this repeats 
in fact, here is the, paradox 
paradox is that hare never catches 
tortoise every time 
reaches step that tortoise 
last time, tortoise would moved 
a tiny bit 
mathematically, 
this is nothing 
we know convergent series 
we know that even though there 
infinitely many small intervals 
sum will converge there 
is indeed a point hare will 
catch tortoise 
problem us is that if i model 
this a hybrid system, i have, again, 
infinitely many switches in finite time 
so, this is this kind infinite 
amount switches is called zeno 
phenomenon traced back 
to zenos many paradoxes motion 
now, lets look another example, one 
thats a hare a tortoise one 
thats rather innocentlooking 
lets say that xdot is negative, x 
positive x 
okay, so we this 
if i write this a this is a hybrid 
automoton, so lets see whats going 
there 
an if i draw this little plot here, 
right, here is here is time heres x 
lets say that x starts there 
well, starts positive so xdot is 
going to , so going to decay 
a slope 
becomes tiny bit negative, oh, 
going to switch back to plus, 
goes in a second, 
becomes a tiny bit positive again, 
switches and, in fact, really 
whats happening is that hits , 
starts switching like crazy here 
in practice, would chatter in 
theory, starts switching like crazy 
here this is actually good 

so, this is really a superzeno 
phenomenon we 
infinitely many switches in finite time, 
we single time instance, 
is system actually hits 
x 
so, that reason, we typically talk 
two different kinds zeno types 
to, so type zeno, is i 
call superzeno says that you get 
infinitely many switches in a single time 
instant 
in this case, again, i want to reiterate 
this, ball came here then, 
ball, this system came here 
started switching infinitely 
many times right there 
now, type is zeno type , 
meaning, you infinitely many 
switches you that a time 
interval bouncing ball is really 
an example that 
so 
there good news bad news in 
rather messy switching 
situation 
bad news is that zeno is a problem 
weve seen 
however, type is arguably 
common type is detectable, 
meaning, is easy to see if youre 
going to end in a situation you 
going to switch infinitely many times 
a single time instant 
good news type is 
that we actually deal 
you know what, 
this system go 
to zero stay 
clear that thats we want 
system to and, in fact, you 
that you will see in next lecture 
now, last piece bad news though is 
that type , 
bouncing ball type, that is hard, 
hard to deal a bouncing ball 
hard to detect it, hard, 
hard to remedy 
this is again, a situation you 
really need to test system see 
i get something like this you 
start seeing an accumulation switch 
times 
if you do, you need to go back 
revisit model 
in next lecture, we will see 
to indeed overcome the, problems that 
a type zeno system will will cause us
