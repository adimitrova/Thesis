so, last time, we saw that 
possible to destabilize a hybrid system 
switching between different modes even 
if different subsystems modes 
stable asymptotically stable 

in this lecture i want to harp this 
theme a little and, in fact, ive 
called danger, beware 
this is actually something that 
we need to aware is 
always so easy to ensure that overall 
hybrid system is stable even if 
subsystems unstable 
in fact, like i saw, we looked a 
counter example that allowed us to 
actually destabilize, means drive 
state to infinity, 
unlucky unclever in we 
transitioned in different 
modes 
so, if we ignore resets, meaning 
there reset maps, state 
doesnt jump youre making 
transitions, we get something called a 
switch system you x dot if is 
fx,u i this a little sigma 
index here sigma is whats known 
switch signal 
so, sigma is going to tell mode 
system is in 
so, if sigma is i in mode 
if sigma is , in mode if 
p in mode p 
so, im is im switching 
between different modes this switch 
signal be, rather different 
random 
driven time 
driven things happening in 
state 
a general way describing 
a switch system 
now, if you that, we actually 
talk different kinds stability 
i wanted to point that 
things actually exist we 
aware 
first is whats known universal 
asymptotic stability universal means 
that there is nothing i to 
destabilize system 
matter what, this upsidedown a means 
sigma, so x will go to 
matter i switch 
thats called universal stability 
notion is existential 
stability, means there exists 
flipped e called an existential 
quantifier 
means, there exists a switch signal 
that makes system stable 
so, them, least there 
is one that makes go to zero 
two main ways in 
people want to deal switch systems 
in case, we dont have, there exists 
a switch signal typically, all, we 
whats called hybrid stability 
that we actually a hybrid system 
that is generating the, switch 
signal this is known hybrid 
stability 
so, x goes to zero, sigma 
sigma, one that 
happens to one that we in 
hybrid system 
so, here results 
lets say that i a hybrid system 
individual modes 
asymptotically stable 
well, then, we guarantee that is 
least existentially stable well, 
clearly, we can, right 
we is we dont switch 
if i design a switch signal that 
picks one mode stays that 
forever ever ever, well, 
never switching individual 
modes asymptotically stable so if 
modes asymptotically stable, we 
never switch voila, 
we an existentially stable 
system 
but, we will have, we seen, 
theyre always universally 
asymptotically stable 
reason this is well, this 
counter example 
reason is that we actually 
destabilize system an unfortunate 
switching between modes 
so, we this well, there 
is something in nonlinear control known 
a common lyapunov function 
im going to talk this in this 
course, 
mainly common lyapunov 
function is an elusive beast that you 
almost never find 
theoretically, thats youre 
going to to hunt 
practically speaking though, you 
need to is following 
first, never design unstable controllers 
youre going to in 
trouble probably, right 
so, design stabilizing controllers 
subsystems 
then, we design switching logic, 
meaning we going to switch 
between different modes if 
lucky we a lot amount free 
time hands, we go find, try 
to find common lyapunov functions 
now, like i said, finding that is really 
art science in sense that 
hard in general to find 
so, important thing here is 
really, we need to aware fact 
that stable subsystems ensure 
asymptotic stability hybrid 
systems 
so, we need to aware test, 
test, test, test, test 
in sense that, run it, see 
happens, we get instabilities induced 
if we do, we need to start messing 
switching logic 
this is really key i cannot 
underemphasize testing aspect 
hybrid system 
in fact, people design avionics 
software, instance, majority 
time is spent test, on, 
development controllers, 
testing that switching logic in 
combination controllers 
induce instability 
so, thats we need to keep an eye
