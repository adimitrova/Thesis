we saw in previous lecture 
to model switch systems in a rather 
general way using things called 
hybrid automaton 
today, i want to show that 
we know to design good linear time 
invariant controllers we know to 
draw a hybrid automaton, doesnt mean 
that we say, sound done, 
we everything we want to able 
to 
in fact, i want to today is talk 
to you a rather famous counter 
example that makes thinngs hard 
youre in hybrid world 
so, im going to answer following 
question, possibly go wrong 
you start switching between different 
controllers 
this tangle yarn here is supposed 
to illustrate happen you 
start switching messing things 
together in, in rather surprising 
manners 
well, lets lets start rather modestly 
lets say that i two modes 
i x dot is equal to ax x dot is 
equal to ax this a a matrices 
look rather 
innocent, if you ask 
small negative value 
diagonals, small diagonal negative 
values, epsilons is positive 
then, offdiagonals, you 
one negative two here, two 
negative one there well, well lets 
check eigen values, 
thats first thing we always 

well, turns that matter 
system you have, a a, 
eigenvalues epsilon plus 
j 
well, this mean well, real 
part is equal to epsilon, is 
strictly negative, so systems 
asymptotically stable, 
meaning that x will die to 
origin 
a nonzero imaginary 
component, 
means that youre going to 
oscillations, 
alright so, we asymptotically 
stable systems oscillations 
and, in fact, lets see happens 
we start combining different modes 
we that though, lets actually 
look modes a little bit 
carefully 
so, here is mode , x dot is ax 
ive plot that here this axis is x 
ive plot that here is x 
this would look like if i time 
here lets say, x, is i would gets 
decaying oscillations 
well, we dont that i 
plotted x x 
this is i start, in this case, 
i guess, i started , system 
starts flowing 
epsilon is small, youre 
going to get closer closer to zero 
slowly 
youre going to spiral in like this 
and, you know, goes to infinity 
youre going to end origin 
you indeed an asymptotically 
stable system 
so, a is wellbehaved 
spirals a little bit we 
care afraid spirals 
heres a 
also looks like a spiral instead 
a tall skinny spiral, a short 
chunky spiral 
again, we start , 
this system starts spiraling 
goes inwards then, sound goes 
like this so also asymptotically 
stable 
particular eigenvectors two 
systems, we end spiraling in slightly 
different ways 
point is we two stable 
systems 
now, lets put together in a hybrid 
automaton 
so, this is hybrid automaton number 
im going to spiral, tall, skinny, 
until x 
this means that second component, so 
x is this guard means, right 
x, i switch to short 
chunky ellipsoid inward spiraling 
system 
then, x, i switch back 
so, this is first hybrid automaton 
well, lets see that actually looks 
like if you 
so, always 
we start , i start in mode 
sound until this point, right, 
x, i switch to mode 
short chunky ellipsoid 
here, x becomes i switch to 
mode so we ,, 
now, we switch to mode , to mode, 
mode , so forth 
we keep that, we spiral in, 
one thing that youre going to notice 
is that actually ending 
origin a much faster rate 
so, this system is 
asymptotically stable, 
asymptotically stabler, is a 
word, way original 
systems, actually converges 
a faster rate 
so, switching, we able to get to 
origin faster, makes you 
wonder, i calling this a counter 
example 
well, this is a counter example 
aha, 
hybrid automaton number , 
maybe that is counter example 
hybrid automoton number 
, i switched guard conditions 
so im switching mode to mode , 
x im switching mode 
to mode , x 
this seems like a modest enough 
modification if you ask me, modesty 
in modesty, 
turns that that is a huge deal 
now, , is hiding somewhere here 
whats happening is that 
starting to spiral 
so now, here we have, instance, that 
x became zero 
now, switching to the, fat 
spiral 
here, x becomes switching to 
skinny spiral 
in this way, going to end 
getting 
this is indeed an unstable system 
this is a little bothering to us 
i took two stable systems i put 
together in a hybrid system, i got 
instabilities 
so punchlines here is, first all, 
stable modes themselves, 
thats enough to guarantee that 
resulting switch to hybrid systems is 
stable 
in fact, you may induce instabilities 
switches 
thats a little bit a downer, to 
completely honest 
thing is that you actually 
reverse this say, you could even 
design unstable modes, never 
going to 
you could actually get a switch 
system that is stable 
so basically, you could reverse time 
we, looked 
we get to unstable modes that renders 
switches here is we actually 
will approach this 
we will design stable modes 
would suicidal to design unstable 
modes hopefully, miraculously 
hope that switches will, will take 
care 
so, going to design, design stable 
modes we need to aware fact 
that new system is stable 
and, in fact, would nice if we 
could check that either analytically 
least in simulation hybrid 
world is a little bit scarier 
nonhybrid world
