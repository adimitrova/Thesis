1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,302
So, in the last lecture, we investigated 
this innocent-looking model or system, 

2
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:10,389
which was a ball bouncing on a surface. 
And we saw something rather strange 

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:15,425
there, which was that, that the, the ball 
ended up bouncing an infinite number of 

4
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:19,221
times in finite time. 
And this is part of another potential 

5
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:24,357
complication that comes from hyberdizing 
your model, namely, that you have these 

6
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,572
kinds of infinitely many swicthes. 
And this is known as the Zeno Phenomenon. 

7
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:32,487
And in today's lecture, we're going to 
dig a little deeper into the, the Zeno 

8
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:36,452
Phenomenon and see what we can do about 
it and if you can understand it. 

9
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:41,032
But fundamentally, what I would like to 
point out is that Zeno is bad, because if 

10
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:45,497
you're actually running something that's 
asked to do an infinite amount of things 

11
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:49,287
in finite time, it crashes. 
If you're running this on the computer, 

12
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:53,082
the simulations crash. 
another thing is that we know that there 

13
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:57,697
is something inaccurate or wrong with our 
model because the ball, if I drop a ball, 

14
00:00:57,697 --> 00:01:00,262
it doesn't bounce an infinite number of 
times, 

15
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:02,852
it bounces 17 times and then it stops 
bouncing. 

16
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,297
So, there's something wrong with our 
model. 

17
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:08,957
That's another warning flag. 
And the third warning flag is that we 

18
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:13,712
don't actually know what the system does 
beyond the, the Zeno point, meaning the 

19
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:17,002
time up to which we have an infinite 
number of switches. 

20
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:21,912
So, since we can't really define what the 
system is doing beyond that point, things 

21
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:26,894
like asymptotic stability is meaningless 
because time is not allowed to really 

22
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:31,090
progress off to infinity. 
So, first of all, why is it called the 

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,846
Zeno phenomenon? Well, there was a Greek 
philosopher, Zeno, Zeno of Elea who spent 

24
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:42,258
a lot of time thinking about movement and 
the dynamic world and basically his point 

25
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:47,802
was that our perception of the world is 
wrong because clearly there are all these 

26
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:51,955
problems out there. For instance, here's 
one of his famous paradoxes. 

27
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:56,406
We have a hare racing a tortoise. And the 
tortoise is a little slower so the 

28
00:01:56,406 --> 00:02:00,386
tortoise gets a head start. 
In fact, the tortoise starts there and 

29
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,928
then, the race is on. 
And at some point, the hare reaches the 

30
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:08,684
point were the tortoise started from but 
at that point, right, the tortoise has 

31
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:11,426
moved, not much but it has moved a little 
bit. 

32
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:15,101
This is how far the tortoise has moved. 
Okay. The race goes on. 

33
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:20,152
And at some point, the hare catches up to 
where the tortoise was last time but now, 

34
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:23,894
the tortoise has moved a little bit more, 
not much, and then this repeats. 

35
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,134
In fact, here is the, the paradox. The 
paradox is that the hare never catches up 

36
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:32,822
with the tortoise because every time it 
reaches the step that the tortoise was 

37
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,874
last time, the tortoise would have moved 
a tiny bit. 

38
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,194
Now mathematically, 
this is nothing. 

39
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:42,259
We know now about convergent series. 
We know that even though there are 

40
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,419
infinitely many of these small intervals 
the sum of them will converge and there 

41
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,915
is indeed a point where the hare will 
catch the tortoise. 

42
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:56,139
but the problem for us is that if I model 
this as a hybrid system, I have, again, 

43
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,964
infinitely many switches in finite time. 
So, this is why this kind of infinite 

44
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:06,025
amount of switches is called the Zeno 
Phenomenon because it can be traced back 

45
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:11,111
to Zeno's many paradoxes about motion. 
Now, let's look at another example, one 

46
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:15,709
that's not a hare and a tortoise but one 
that's rather innocent-looking. 

47
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:22,478
Let's say that x-dot is negative, for +x 
- 1 and it's positive for -x. 

48
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:26,644
Okay, so we have this. 
If I write this as a this is a hybrid 

49
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:30,088
automoton, so let's see what's going 
there. 

50
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:36,300
An if I draw this little plot here, 
right, here is here is time and here's x. 

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,912
Let's say that x starts there. 
Well, it starts positive so x-dot is 

52
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:45,574
going to be -1, so it's going to decay 
down with a slope of -1 and then it 

53
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:51,567
becomes tiny bit negative, and then oh, 
it's going to switch back up to plus, and 

54
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:56,517
then it goes up and in a second, it 
becomes just a tiny bit positive again, 

55
00:03:56,517 --> 00:04:01,742
it switches down and, in fact, really 
what's happening is that once it hits 0, 

56
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,592
it starts switching like crazy here. 
In practice, it would chatter but in 

57
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:11,592
theory, it starts switching like crazy 
here and this is actually not good at 

58
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,484
all. 
So, this is really a Super-Zeno 

59
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:21,163
Phenomenon because not only do we have 
infinitely many switches in finite time, 

60
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:27,826
we have it at the single time instance, 
which is when the system actually hits 

61
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:31,609
x=0. 
So, for that reason, we typically talk 

62
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:37,342
about two different kinds of Zeno types 
to, so type 1 Zeno, which is what I now 

63
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:43,055
call the Super-Zeno. It says that you get 
infinitely many switches in a single time 

64
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:46,410
instant. 
In this case, again, I want to reiterate 

65
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,890
this, the ball came down here and then, 
not the ball, this system came down here 

66
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,502
and then it started switching infinitely 
many times right there. 

67
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:01,117
Now, type 2 is Zeno by not type 1, 
meaning, you have infinitely many 

68
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:06,927
switches but you have that over a time 
interval and the bouncing ball is really 

69
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,467
an example of that. 
So. 

70
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:13,882
there are some good news and bad news in 
all these rather messy switching 

71
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:17,542
situation. 
The bad news is that Zeno is a problem as 

72
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,777
we've seen. 
However, type 1 which is arguably the 

73
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:25,077
more common type is not only detectable, 
meaning, it is easy to see if you're 

74
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:29,832
going to end up in a situation where you 
are going to switch infinitely many times 

75
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:32,992
at a single time instant. 
But the other good news about type 1 is 

76
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:36,462
that we can actually deal with it because 
you know what, 

77
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:41,443
what should this system do? It should go 
down to zero and then it should stay at 

78
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:44,107
0. 
It's clear that that's what we want the 

79
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:49,560
system to do and, in fact, you can do 
that as you will see in the next lecture. 

80
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,002
Now, the last piece of bad news though is 
that type 2, 

81
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:57,043
the bouncing ball type, that is hard, 
it's hard to deal with a bouncing ball. 

82
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,983
It's hard to detect it, it hard, it's 
hard to remedy it. 

83
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:04,252
and this is again, a situation where you 
really need to test your system and see 

84
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:08,250
do I get something like this where you 
start seeing an accumulation of switch 

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,002
times. 
And if you do, you need to go back and 

86
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:15,007
revisit your model. 
But in the next lecture, we will see how 

87
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:20,990
to indeed overcome the, the problems that 
a type 1 Zeno system will will cause us.
