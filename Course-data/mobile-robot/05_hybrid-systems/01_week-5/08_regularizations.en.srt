1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,961
So last time we saw that we could 
actually test for type1 zeno and the way 

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:14,712
we could test this was to see whether or 
not the gradient dg, dx transpose points 

3
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:20,692
in the same direction as f2, in the 
opposite direction of f1. 

4
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:24,262
So if I have that, then I do have type 1 
zeno. 

5
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:30,834
And we came up with a little probe here 
to check whether or not, this is indeed 

6
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:34,722
happening. 
So, the first thing we do is we check 

7
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:37,694
LF1G negative, and LF. 
2 G positive. 

8
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:41,741
Where LFG was this thing we called the 
lead derivative. 

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:47,079
Which was simply just fancy speak for DG, 
DX times, in this case, F1 of X. 

10
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,504
That's all it means. 
So this is the probe that checks whether 

11
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:56,200
or not sliding occurs. 
Today, I want to talk about what's called 

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,142
regularizations, which is. 
Code for okay, let's say we have that, we 

13
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:06,092
have sliding, how do we compute how we 
slide? And it turns out that this is 

14
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:11,242
going to be very important when we move 
on to robotics because this occurs quite 

15
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:15,717
a bit when you actually start running 
robotic navigation systems. 

16
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:22,635
So today's lecture is all about How to be 
actually slide along this surface.Well, 

17
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:27,815
lets actually try to be a little careful 
in [UNKNOWN]. 

18
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:34,621
So if I'm sliding here, what is 
characterizing that motion well, i know 

19
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:41,988
that g(x)=0 which means that if i take 
the time, the relative of g, we respect 

20
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:49,362
to t Then it should be 0 because g is not 
going to change when I'm sliding because 

21
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:54,512
I'm staying at g=0. 
So one thing we need to do is say that 

22
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:58,827
dg/dt=0. 
Well, let's see where that takes us, 

23
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:05,393
dg/dt It is equal to dgdx*xdot. 
So now what is x dot along here. 

24
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:13,060
Well, what I am going to postulate is 
that it's a combination of f2 and f1. 

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,403
In fact let's say that is equal to 
sigma1*f1+sigma2+f2. 

26
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:25,449
So it's a convex combination of, of these 
two Vector fields. 

27
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:31,357
So if I do that, I get instead of x dots, 
I get this thing here sigma 1 f1 plus 

28
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:35,680
sigma 2 f2. 
Well, since these are scalars, I can 

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,353
actually pull them out here, which means 
that I can write this expression that's 

30
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:48,606
is a little bit messy looking like sigma 
1 times the lead derivative of g along f1 

31
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:52,702
plus sigma 2 times the lead derivative of 
g along f2. 

32
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:57,277
So that's what the time derivative of g 
actually is. 

33
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:03,452
But I want that to be equal to 0. 
This needs to be equal to 0 because that 

34
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:08,127
was our condition. 
So if I put this thing equal 0 then I can 

35
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:14,217
solve for instance for sigma 2 and I get. 
This expression right here. 

36
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:17,717
So I know how σ2 is going to depend on 
σ1. 

37
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:22,892
Well that's a good start. 
We also know that both σ need to be 

38
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:29,192
positive because I'm not allowed to 
always start flowing backwards and they 

39
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:35,240
also should sum up to 1 because otherwise 
they can go super fast along this 

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,017
direction which I typically don't want. 
I want it to respect the dynamics. 

41
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:42,489
So. 
I have additional constraint too. 

42
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,368
So the sigma needs to be positive and 
they need to sum up to 1. 

43
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:49,270
Well. 
let's see how we can actually solve it. 

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,435
So, let's go back to our old friend, the 
example. 

45
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:57,162
And again this example. 
Looks like this, where, you know what? 

46
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:01,482
I'm sliding down with slope -1. 
Here's x and here's time. 

47
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:06,862
And when I hit the switching surface, I 
stay with x=0 for the duration. 

48
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:12,597
Okay, what is the switching surface, 
first of all? Well, it's x=0, so g(x) is 

49
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,192
simply x=0. 
Okay, 

50
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:17,356
let's compute some of these Lee 
derivatives. 

51
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,645
So, lf1g. 
It's, it's the derivative of g, with 

52
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:24,377
respect to x. 
So, the derivative of that with respect 

53
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:27,354
to x, is simply 1. 
F1 is simply negative 1. 

54
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:32,562
So, the Lee derivative is negative 1. 
Which is 1 of the things we needed for 

55
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,893
zeno. 
We needed, or for sliding. 

56
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:39,302
We needed this to be negative for, type 1 
zeno to occur. 

57
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:43,371
That's the first. 
Well let's do the same for f 2. 

58
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:47,920
Sorry this is an f 2 right here, 
apologize about that. 

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,821
l f 2 g well it's a dgdx which equals the 
derivative of that with respect to x 

60
00:04:53,821 --> 00:05:00,194
which is 1, and f 2 which is plus 1. 
Right, so I get 1*1, which is equal to 1, 

61
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:07,108
which is positive, which was the other 
condition for having Type 1 Zeno. 

62
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:12,761
So we know that we actually have Type 1 
Zeno, or sliding, here. 

63
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:17,668
okay. 
So now, let's try figuring out what what 

64
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:23,427
the The sigmas should actually be. 
Well, we had a formula for sigma 2.. 

65
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:29,419
It is equal to -sigma1 and these two Lee 
derivatives divided by eachother. 

66
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,990
Well, this was -1 and this was +1 so 
sigma 2 is simple equal to sigma 1. 

67
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,574
Rather simple. 
[INAUDIBLE]. 

68
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:42,872
But what, what are they? Well, recall 
that the need to sum up to 1. 

69
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:46,423
Which means that they both have to be a 
half. 

70
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:52,672
What this actually means, then, is that 
we can compute what the induced mode, 

71
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:58,036
sliding mode, actually is. 
Well, I take sigma 1 * f1, which is half 

72
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:03,163
of f1. 
And then i take sigma2 times F2 which is 

73
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:11,535
half of F2, well F1 is negative one and 
F2 is plus one so i get -0.5 + 0.5 and 

74
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:16,474
that's equal to 0. 
So I know that my induced mode, in this 

75
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:20,211
case, is x dot = 0, which is exactly what 
we wanted. 

76
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:24,857
because remember this picture that we've 
drawn over and over again. 

77
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:29,521
We want to start here, get down there, 
and then keep staying at 0. 

78
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:33,044
And the math turns out to work out, in 
this case. 

79
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:36,362
Now, let's find the induced mode in 
general. 

80
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:40,532
I know that the general formula for 
sigma2 and I, I want to point out that 

81
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:45,182
this is not a formula any one in their 
right mind should memorize, but we should 

82
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:49,012
know where it comes from and be able to 
use it when we need to. 

83
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:52,792
But, here is the general formula for the, 
for the induced mode. 

84
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:58,073
Well, we also have that sigma 1 plus 
sigma 2, is equals to 1, which means that 

85
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:03,304
I can take sigma 2 here, and plug it in, 
because this is what sigma 2 is. 

86
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:08,925
So now I have an expression on sigma 1 so 
if I solve that, I acutally know what 

87
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:12,326
sigma 1 is. 
I encourage you to go through the math 

88
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:17,686
yourself, it's a little bit of a mouth 
full, but what its, what it tells me is 

89
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:21,885
that I compute sigma 1, and I can compute 
sigma 2, just as well. 

90
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:26,800
And, if I now sum all of this up 
together, I get this expression inside 

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,702
the pink box there. 
And I recognize again, this is a little 

92
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:36,383
bit of a mouthful, but what this tells me 
is Exactly what the induced mode is. 

93
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:42,724
So I am going to put a sweet heart around 
this thing, not because it's particularly 

94
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:49,015
pretty but because it's systematic and it 
tell us how to actually find the sliding 

95
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:55,814
mode controller or the induced mode which 
means that we know Exactly, not only when 

96
00:07:55,814 --> 00:08:00,337
type 1 zeno occurs. 
But how to progress beyond it. 

97
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:05,809
So, let's figure it out. 
If I have, this is my hybrid system. 

98
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,023
And, if this is a type 1 zeno hybrid 
automaton. 

99
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:16,012
How do I regularize it? What do I do to 
add this extra sliding mode? Well, this 

100
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,642
is what I do. 
Now, let's parse this, even though it 

101
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:24,417
looks a little bit like a mouthful, let's 
figure out what it means. 

102
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:29,742
So let's say I'm here, g is positive. 
G is positive and all is, all is well. 

103
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:34,132
Then, if g becomes 0 and the sliding 
condition is satisfied. 

104
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:38,508
Then I move in to what we just computed 
here which is the induce mode. 

105
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:43,147
And again it's a little bit of a mouth 
full but we will see later on that in 

106
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,475
robotics we have no choice but to 
actually use this. 

107
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:51,352
So then I'm going to use this mode until 
if g becomes positive I jump back to f1. 

108
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:57,286
If g becomes negative I jump to f2. 
And of course we don't always have Type 1 

109
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:04,303
Zeno some switches are nice if I simply 
end up g negative, I jump directly from 

110
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:10,649
mode 1 to mode 2 and vice versa. 
So, this is how you take a hybrid system 

111
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:16,306
and make it immune to the Nauseous and 
bad effects of Type 1 Zeno. 

112
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:22,168
And the nice thing is that this is 
completely general, and we don't ever 

113
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:27,294
again have to worry about Zeno. 
Type 1 Zeno, Type 2 Zeno we already said 

114
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:30,668
them about. 
Having said that this actually brings me 

115
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:34,209
to the summary of this entire model and 
hybrid systems. 

116
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,944
So, what do we have, we have models, we 
have very rich models which are the 

117
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:43,195
hybrid [UNKNOWN] models. 
We have something what we call Stability 

118
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:48,268
Awareness or just We're aware of the fact 
that, just because the submodules, or the 

119
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:52,817
submodes are stable themselves doesn't 
mean that the hybrid system is stable. 

120
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,254
And we need to be aware of it, test for 
it. 

121
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:59,266
We also have seen zeno as another awkward 
hybridization that occurs. 

122
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,702
Or an awkward phenomenon that can occur 
when you go hybrid. 

123
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,850
we have 2 classes of zeno. 
1, which is type 2, which is the bouncing 

124
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,837
ball. 
Infinitely many switch, many switches in 

125
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:13,871
finite, but not, not zero time. 
That's bad and scary, and we can't do 

126
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,361
anything about it except, look out for 
it. 

127
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:20,011
But then, we have type 1. 
And we now know, not only how to check 

128
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,526
for it. 
But how to get around it using these 

129
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:28,412
things that I call regularizations or the 
induced sliding mode and with that if I 

130
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:35,754
had, you know a confetti, I would toss it 
up into the air because this ends the 

131
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:41,697
massive part and the pre-robotics part 
really of this course. 

132
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:47,842
So what we're going to do in the next 
module is go back to robotics. 

133
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:54,478
Apply, all of our new and awesome tools, 
and see, how we can unleash them to 

134
00:10:54,478 --> 00:11:00,408
actually make mobile ro, robots do cool 
things in the real world. 

135
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,254
Well done.
