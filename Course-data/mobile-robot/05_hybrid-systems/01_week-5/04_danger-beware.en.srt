1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,273
So, last time, we saw that it was 
possible to destabilize a hybrid system 

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:11,136
by switching between different modes even 
if the different subsystems or modes were 

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,322
stable or asymptotically stable 
themselves. 

4
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:18,765
in this lecture I want to harp on this 
theme a little more and, in fact, I've 

5
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,471
called it Danger, Beware! 
because this is actually something that 

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,825
we need to be aware of and it is not 
always so easy to ensure that the overall 

7
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,657
hybrid system is stable even if the 
subsystems are unstable. 

8
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:35,332
In fact, like I saw, we looked at a 
counter example that allowed us to 

9
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:40,482
actually destabilize, which means drive 
the state off to infinity, by being 

10
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:45,157
unlucky or unclever in how we 
transitioned in and out of the different 

11
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:48,032
modes. 
So, if we ignore the resets, meaning 

12
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:52,282
there are no reset maps, the state 
doesn't jump when you're making 

13
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:58,092
transitions, we get something called a 
switch system where you have x dot if is 

14
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:04,661
f(x,u) but now I have this a little sigma 
index here and sigma is what's known as 

15
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:09,281
the switch signal. 
So, sigma is going to tell me which mode 

16
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:13,112
the system is in. 
So, if sigma is 1 I am in mode 1. 

17
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:17,192
If sigma is 10, it's in mode 10 or if 
it's p it's in mode p. 

18
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:22,402
So, all I'm doing is I'm switching 
between different modes and this switch 

19
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:26,749
signal can be, be rather different. 
It can be just random. 

20
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:30,972
It can be driven by time. 
It can be driven by things happening in 

21
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:34,429
the state. 
But it's a very general way of describing 

22
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:38,844
a switch system. 
Now, if you have that, we can actually 

23
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:44,276
talk about different kinds of stability. 
And I just wanted to point out that these 

24
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:48,178
things actually exist and we should be 
aware of them. 

25
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:53,708
The first is what's known as universal 
asymptotic stability. And universal means 

26
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:57,486
that there is nothing I can do to 
destabilize the system. 

27
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:02,505
No matter what, this upside-down A means 
for all sigma, so x will go to 0 no 

28
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,499
matter how I switch. 
That's called universal stability. 

29
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:12,412
The other notion is existential 
stability, which means there exists the 

30
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:15,551
flipped E it's called an existential 
quantifier. 

31
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:20,312
It means, there exists a switch signal 
that makes the system stable. 

32
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:24,942
So, not all of them, but at least there 
is one that makes it go down to zero. 

33
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:29,987
And these are the two main ways in which 
people want to deal with switch systems. 

34
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:35,177
In our case, we don't have, there exists 
a switch signal typically, or for all, we 

35
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:40,531
have what's called hybrid stability and 
that we actually have a hybrid system 

36
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:45,859
that is itself generating the, the switch 
signal and this is known as hybrid 

37
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,341
stability. 
So, x goes to zero, not for any all sigma 

38
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:54,896
or for all sigma, but for the one that 
happens to be the one that we have in our 

39
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:58,188
hybrid system. 
So, here are some results. 

40
00:02:58,188 --> 00:03:04,602
Let's say that I have a hybrid system 
where all the individual modes are 

41
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:10,068
asymptotically stable. 
Well, then, can we guarantee that it is 

42
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:14,644
at least existentially stable? Well, 
clearly, we can, right? 

43
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:19,907
Because what we do is we don't switch. 
If I design a switch signal that just 

44
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:25,095
picks one mode and then stays with that 
forever and ever and ever, well, we're 

45
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:30,309
never switching but all the individual 
modes are asymptotically stable so if all 

46
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:34,434
the modes are asymptotically stable, we 
never switch and voila, 

47
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,732
we do have an existentially stable 
system. 

48
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:42,742
But, as we will have, as we have seen, 
they're not always universally 

49
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:47,196
asymptotically stable. 
And the reason for this is well, this 

50
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:50,714
counter example. 
The reason is that we can actually 

51
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:55,827
destabilize the system by an unfortunate 
switching between the modes. 

52
00:03:55,827 --> 00:04:01,047
So, what do we do about this? Well, there 
is something in nonlinear control known 

53
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:05,192
as a common Lyapunov function. 
I'm not going to talk about this in this 

54
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,772
course, 
mainly because the common Lyapunov 

55
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:11,322
function is an elusive beast that you can 
almost never find. 

56
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:15,157
But theoretically, that's what you're 
going to have to hunt for. 

57
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:19,161
Practically speaking though, what you 
need to do is the following. 

58
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:24,690
First, never design unstable controllers 
because then you're going to be in 

59
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,849
trouble probably, right? 
So, design stabilizing controllers for 

60
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,917
the subsystems. 
And then, we design the switching logic, 

61
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:38,413
meaning how are we going to switch 
between the different modes and if we're 

62
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:43,567
lucky or we have a lot amount of free 
time on our hands, we can go find, or try 

63
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:49,012
to find these common Lyapunov functions. 
Now, like I said, finding that is really 

64
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:53,777
more art than science in the sense that 
it's very hard in general to find it. 

65
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:58,402
So, the most important thing here is 
really, we need to be aware of the fact 

66
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:03,363
that stable subsystems do not ensure 
asymptotic stability of the hybrid 

67
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:06,585
systems. 
So, we need to be aware of it and test, 

68
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:10,245
test, test, test, test. 
In the sense that, run it, see what 

69
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:15,513
happens, do we get instabilities induced? 
And if we do, we need to start messing 

70
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:19,709
with our switching logic. 
But this is really key and I cannot 

71
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,310
underemphasize the testing aspect of the 
hybrid system. 

72
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,040
In fact, when people design avionics 
software, for instance, the majority of 

73
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,255
the time is spent not on test, on, on the 
development of the controllers, but on 

74
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:38,069
testing that the switching logic in 
combination with the controllers does not 

75
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,975
induce instability. 
So, that's what we need to keep an eye 

76
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:43,975
out for.
