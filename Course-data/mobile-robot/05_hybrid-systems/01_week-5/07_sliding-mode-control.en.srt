00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,028
Last time we saw that not only we have to 
worry about Zeno. 

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:09,111
This zeno problem or the zeno phenomenon 
comes in two different flavors. 

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:14,737
And one thing that I stated was that type 
1 zeno which is infinitely many switches 

4
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:20,082
in zero time or in one timing sense here 
represented by this system where. 

5
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:26,036
Again, if I have x here, and time here, 
and I start positive, then x is going to 

6
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:29,515
be -1 until x becomes, just, just 
negative. 

7
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:35,091
And then, we're going to get this 
infinitely many switches going on right 

8
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,160
there. 
that's type 1. 

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,872
Well, it turns out, that we can actually 
remedy this. 

10
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:47,339
And the reason for it is, you know what 
is very, very clear what should happen. 

11
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:52,784
The system shouldn't grind to a halt. 
It should just nicely keep continuing on 

12
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:55,182
like this 
Like x is equal to 0. 

13
00:00:55,182 --> 00:01:01,151
So how do I take this intuitive notion of 
that x should just keep saying and be 

14
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:05,122
equal to 0 and make that mathematically 
sound. 

15
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:10,928
What, what's the topic of today's 
lecture, and this construction by which 

16
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:17,136
we can continue beyond the zeno point in 
the type 1 zeno system, using something 

17
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:20,088
that's known as. 
Sliding mode control. 

18
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,250
So, let's be a little bit general here. 
Let's say that I have one system, x dot 

19
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,030
is f1(x) and then I have a switching 
surface, g(x). 

20
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,772
And when g is negative, I switch to f 
two, and when it becomes positive I 

21
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:37,963
switch back to f1. 
So here it is, here's my switching 

22
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:41,455
surface, g(x) = 0, that's where the 
action is. 

23
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:47,254
Now on this side I'm going to be using 
f1, and da, da, da, da, da, da, da, when 

24
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:51,924
I hit this point, well let's say that f1 
is pointing inwards. 

25
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:56,012
Well on this part of the world I am going 
to be using f2. 

26
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:59,644
Well, let's say that f2 here points 
outwards. 

27
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:04,380
This means that when I hit this point 
again, I grind to a halt. 

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,615
so this is really what's going on is that 
both of the vector fields both f1 and f2 

29
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:16,029
point in the wrong direction. 
So f1 points over in to the f2 territory. 

30
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:21,302
f2 points over in the f1 territory, but 
again it's clear what should really 

31
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:24,267
happen. 
We should somehow slide along the 

32
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,255
switching surface here. 
That's clear because f1 and f2 are 

33
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:34,056
pulling in different directions and this 
is why it's known as sliding mode control 

34
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:38,502
because what we do is we slide along the 
switching surface. 

35
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:42,602
So let's see how to actually make this 
sliding happen. 

36
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:48,687
Again, I have g positive on this side, g 
negative on this side, and the switching 

37
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:52,887
surface is g = 0. 
f2 wants to drive me in this direction, 

38
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:56,112
and f1 wants to drive me in this 
direction. 

39
00:02:56,112 --> 00:03:01,402
I want to slide along the surface. 
That should be the right solution. 

40
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:05,977
Well first of all what are the conditions 
under which I'm going to slide. 

41
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:10,557
Well f2 needs to point in the positive 
direction of g because on this side g is 

42
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,257
positive. 
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

43
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:18,487
find this thing, the vector that's normal 
to the switching surface and it turns out 

44
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:23,871
that luckily for us this is the gradient. 
The partial derivative of g with respect 

45
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,616
to x, transpose. 
And now I take what's called the inner 

46
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,703
product, so, with this thing and this 
thing. 

47
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:33,892
So the inner product is just a 
multiplication. 

48
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:39,282
and if this inner product is positive, it 
means that this one and this one are 

49
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:42,039
pointing. 
in the same direction. 

50
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,046
I also take the inter-product with this 
and that, and if the inter-product is 

51
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:54,920
negative, it means that they're pointing 
in, in different directions. So what this 

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,778
means is I actually have a condition for 
sliding. 

53
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:03,113
I need dg the x, where this is actually 
dg, dx1, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 

54
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:11,568
dg, the xn a roll vector like this times 
f1, well f11 to f1n, 'cause these are all 

55
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:16,365
vectors. 
If this is negative, that is code for 

56
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:22,967
having this arrow and this arrow pointing 
in different directions. 

57
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:29,542
So, f1 points into negative g territory. 
f2 points into positive g territory. 

58
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:35,237
if this happens at the switching surface, 
then we have sliding. 

59
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:41,697
And, one way we can think about this 
object here, it's the derivative of g, in 

60
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:46,067
the direction f1. 
And this is the derivative of g in the 

61
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:50,255
direction f2, and there's actually a 
fancy term for this. 

62
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:55,677
it's called the Lie derivative. 
So the derivative of G in the direction 

63
00:04:55,677 --> 00:05:00,675
f, we're going to write this Lfg which is 
simply code for dg/dx * f. 

64
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:08,160
So when I write Lfg, this is what I mean. 
It's the lead derivative of g in the 

65
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,887
direction of f. 
So, using our slightly fancier notation 

66
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:18,867
we know that sliding occurs. 
Meaning we should slide if the 

67
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:24,142
derivative, g, in the f1 direction is 
negative, which, again, means this and 

68
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:29,417
this have different directions, and the 
derivative of g in the f2 direction is 

69
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:35,930
positive, which means this and this have 
the same signs meaning they point in the 

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,409
same, in the same directions. 
So this actually tells us whether or not 

71
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:47,290
we have sliding and wallah, we actually 
have a test for type 1 zeno that says 

72
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,152
that sliding occurs. 
If Lf1g is negative and Lf2g is positive, 

73
00:05:53,152 --> 00:06:01,107
and this is at g(x) = 0 so this is along 
the switching surface when we're inside 

74
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:06,070
the different mode regime. 
We don't have to worry about this. 

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,141
But on the switching surface, 
this our zeno type 1 probe that we have 

76
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:14,724
to use to see whether or not we slide. 
And this nice because this is something 

77
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:18,893
that's easily implemented. 
We still don't know what actually happens 

78
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,833
beyond the zeno point, meaning, how do we 
slide. 

79
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,906
And that is going to be the topic of next 
lecture.
