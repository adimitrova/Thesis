1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,927
So welcome to Module 5 of the course, 
Control of Mobile Robots. 

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:10,587
So far the first 2 modules were kind of 
introductions to the topic and the 

3
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:16,747
previous 2 modules they went rather 
deeply into the issue of, control the 

4
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:23,047
sign for linear time in variant systems. 
And we ended the last module on a high 

5
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:26,127
note. 
Which showed that we could do rather 

6
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:31,177
remarkable things, like make a humanoid 
robot wave in, exciting ways. 

7
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:34,902
Using, control of linear time in variant 
systems. 

8
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,152
Now, unfortunately, the world isn't that 
easy. 

9
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:41,652
And especially, the robotic world is not 
that easy. 

10
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:45,712
So this entire module is devoted to how 
do we take Module 4. 

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:51,168
And make it cope with the realities of 
the world in which robots are embedded. 

12
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:56,204
Then in Module 6, we're actually going to 
go full force robotics, 100%. 

13
00:00:56,204 --> 00:01:01,714
And this module can be thought of as the 
glue module between linear systems and 

14
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:05,448
actual robotics. 
And in fact, the title of this lecture 

15
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:10,935
is, Switches Everywhere, because so far 
the modules, or models have been the same 

16
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:15,741
all the time, and in fact, because the 
models are the same, we design a size 

17
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:20,188
fits all type of controller. 
the way we've kind of messed with the 

18
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,249
controllers, is by changing the, the, 
reference values to some desired angles 

19
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:28,522
for the.... 
this humanoid robot, or desired 

20
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,178
velocities and angular velocities for the 
segue robot. 

21
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:37,152
But, it's certainly not always true that 
the models never change in the real 

22
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:40,055
world. 
And, this is never true in robotics, 

23
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,640
unfortunately. 
In fact, if you recall, what we talked 

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,638
about in module 2. 
We talked about something called behavior 

25
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:50,927
based control. 
Where the robot switches between 

26
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:55,617
different modes of operation, or 
behaviors, in response to what the world 

27
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:59,092
throws at you. 
You see an obstacle, you switch to avoid 

28
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:02,637
that obstacle. 
If you, need to go recharge you switch to 

29
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:07,357
a, let's look for outlets behavior. 
So what we need to do is somehow come to 

30
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:12,637
grips, or terms with this reality. 
And that is how we're going to start this 

31
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:16,094
module. 
The first thing to note is that in the 

32
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:21,937
world there are switches everywhere. 
So here, over on our left, is a bipedal 

33
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:26,168
walking robot. 
Well, bipedal walking robots have a leg 

34
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:31,803
that's swinging, has one dynamics, and 
then bam, the ro, the leg is on the 

35
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:36,893
ground, now the dynamics changed. 
So because of the fact that the dynamics 

36
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,915
changes. 
Depending on whether or not you're in the 

37
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:43,474
swing face, or the stance face. 
The dynamics is different. 

38
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:45,993
Here, I drew a cartoon of a bouncing 
ball. 

39
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,851
Well, it has 2 modes. 
It's in the air, [SOUND]. 

40
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:51,518
And then it bounces. 
Something new happens. 

41
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:55,102
The b-, the ball gets squished, and then 
it releases again. 

42
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:57,022
So, there. 
We have switches. 

43
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:01,357
I actually included this wonderful 
picture of locusts because I have 

44
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:05,762
actually worked on locusts. 
These locusts don't bother anyone during 

45
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:09,982
what's called a solitary mode. 
And then something happens and they 

46
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:14,762
switch to a gregarious mode where they 
lump together and devastate harvests 

47
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:18,164
everywhere. 
and this is a transition that occurs 

48
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:23,243
because of a lack of food, for instance. 
But in the, all of these cases, these are 

49
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:27,752
naturally occurring switches that our 
models have to take into account. 

50
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:32,618
Now, from a robotics point of view, it 
may be slightly more relevant to look at 

51
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:36,132
switches by design instead of doing it by 
necessity. 

52
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:40,625
So here is a gear box to a car. 
We're switching between different gears 

53
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,713
because we want the car to run more 
smoothly at different RPM's. 

54
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:49,490
so we're switching the dynamics not 
because we have to but because it's 

55
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,824
better. 
Here, this is a, a cockpit. 

56
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:56,526
It's supposed to be representing an 
autopilot on an aircraft where you're 

57
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:00,322
switching between cruise climb turn land 
takeoff modes. 

58
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:04,537
So, instead of designing 1 controller 
that takes me from Atlanta, Georgia to 

59
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,932
Stockholm, Sweden. 
You have a bunch of different controllers 

60
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,702
that you're switching through in order to 
do this. 

61
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:13,402
And at the bottom here, we have a sensor 
network. 

62
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:17,847
Where, in order to preserve power, you're 
turning sensors on and off on purpose. 

63
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,822
So, you're switching by design, rather by 
necessity. 

64
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,782
And, in robotics. 
Everywhere it switches by design. 

65
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:28,092
This is our south driving Georgia Tech 
car that switches between different 

66
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:31,077
behaviors depending on what's happening 
in the world. 

67
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:35,037
Here's a mobile robot that switches 
between behaviors depending or not, 

68
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:38,952
whether or not there are obstacles, I 
wish we worked on snake robotics. 

69
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:43,202
We're switching between different modes, 
depending on what is going on in the 

70
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:46,876
environment. 
This is a friend in now, this is the 

71
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:53,423
sensor network, and this is the aerial 
robot that we've seen, and we're going to 

72
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:57,268
see more of. 
In all of these cases, we're going to 

73
00:04:57,268 --> 00:05:02,571
have to switch in order to respond to 
what the world throw's our way. 

74
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:06,702
Now, there are some issues that we need 
to deal with. 

75
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:11,242
Issue number one is really how do we 
model these switches? How do we model 

76
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:14,390
systems that aren't staying the same all 
the time. 

77
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,394
Well, the other question then, of course, 
is if these models change, what about 

78
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:24,304
stability? What about the performance? 
Can we go with our old methods to try to 

79
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:28,658
understand this? Well, this all boils 
down to the fact, that T does not go to 

80
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:32,339
infinity, within a single mode. 
Meaning you are not staying in 1 mode 

81
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,451
forever, and stability is defined what 
happens when T goes to infinity, but T 

82
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,187
does not go to infinity in the in, 
individual mode. 

83
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:44,212
So, we somewhat need to understand that. 
We also have issues of compositionality. 

84
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:49,787
This is fancy speak for saying, if I have 
multiple modes and multiple controllers, 

85
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:55,037
how do I put them together? What is the 
way in which they fit together like Lego 

86
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:59,787
pieces in a big Lego drawing. 
And, most importantly, are there traps? 

87
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:05,103
Are there issues that arise because of 
these switches that we don't fully know 

88
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,558
how to deal with. 
Now, this module will deal with all of 

89
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:12,013
this, and more. 
And in the next lecture, we're going to 

90
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:17,224
start with the first question which is, 
how do we really model hybrid or switched 

91
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,827
systems in a systematic and coherent way?
