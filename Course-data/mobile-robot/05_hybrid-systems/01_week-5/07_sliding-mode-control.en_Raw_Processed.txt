last time we saw that we to 
worry zeno 
this zeno problem zeno phenomenon 
comes in two different flavors 
one thing that i stated that type 
zeno is infinitely many switches 
in zero time in one timing sense here 
represented this system 
again, if i x here, time here, 
i start positive, x is going to 
until x becomes, just, 
negative 
then, going to get this 
infinitely many switches going right 
there 
thats type 
well, turns out, that we actually 
remedy this 
reason is, you know 
is very, clear happen 
system shouldnt grind to a halt 
nicely keep continuing 
like this 
like x is equal to 
so i take this intuitive notion 
that x keep saying 
equal to make that mathematically 
sound 
what, whats topic todays 
lecture, this construction 
we continue beyond zeno point in 
type zeno system, using something 
thats known 
sliding mode control 
so, lets a little bit general here 
lets say that i one system, x dot 
is fx i a switching 
surface, gx 
g is negative, i switch to f 
two, becomes positive i 
switch back to f 
so here is, heres switching 
surface, gx , thats 
action is 
this side im going to using 
f, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, 
i hit this point, well lets say that f 
is pointing inwards 
well this part world i going 
to using f 
well, lets say that f here points 
outwards 
this means that i hit this point 
again, i grind to a halt 
so this is really whats going is that 
vector fields f f 
point in wrong direction 
so f points in to f territory 
f points in f territory, 
clear really 
happen 
we somehow slide along 
switching surface here 
thats clear f f 
pulling in different directions this 
is known sliding mode control 
we is we slide along 
switching surface 
so lets see to actually make this 
sliding happen 
again, i g positive this side, g 
negative this side, switching 
surface is g 
f wants to drive in this direction, 
f wants to drive in this 
direction 
i want to slide along surface 
that right solution 
well first conditions 
im going to slide 
well f needs to point in positive 
direction g this side g is 
positive 
so im going to is im going to 
find this thing, vector thats normal 
to switching surface turns 
that luckily us this is gradient 
partial derivative g respect 
to x, transpose 
i take whats called inner 
product, so, this thing this 
thing 
so inner product is a 
multiplication 
if this inner product is positive, 
means that this one this one 
pointing 
in direction 
i also take interproduct this 
that, if interproduct is 
negative, means that theyre pointing 
in, in different directions so this 
means is i actually a condition 
sliding 
i need dg x, this is actually 
dg, dx, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
dg, xn a roll vector like this times 
f, well f to fn, cause 
vectors 
if this is negative, that is code 
this arrow this arrow pointing 
in different directions 
so, f points negative g territory 
f points positive g territory 
if this happens switching surface, 
we sliding 
and, one way we think this 
object here, derivative g, in 
direction f 
this is derivative g in 
direction f, theres actually a 
fancy term this 
called lie derivative 
so derivative g in direction 
f, going to write this lfg is 
simply code dgdx f 
so i write lfg, this is i mean 
lead derivative g in 
direction f 
so, using slightly fancier notation 
we know that sliding occurs 
meaning we slide if 
derivative, g, in f direction is 
negative, which, again, means this 
this different directions, 
derivative g in f direction is 
positive, means this this 
signs meaning point in 
same, in directions 
so this actually tells us whether 
we sliding wallah, we actually 
a test type zeno that says 
that sliding occurs 
if lfg is negative lfg is positive, 
this is gx so this is along 
switching surface inside 
different mode regime 
we dont to worry this 
switching surface, 
this zeno type probe that we 
to use to see whether we slide 
this nice this is something 
thats easily implemented 
we still dont know actually happens 
beyond zeno point, meaning, we 
slide 
that is going to topic next
