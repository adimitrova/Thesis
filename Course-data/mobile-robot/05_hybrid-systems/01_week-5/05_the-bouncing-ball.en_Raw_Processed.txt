so welcome back 
today, i would like to investigate a 
particular hybrid system that to 
a bouncing ball 
so, that is, i take a ball i drop 
a surface i would first all, 
like to model 
secondly, like to figure 
ball behaves 
reason i want to this is 
necessarily i really like 
balls this bouncing ball 
example holds key to another little 
peculiarity hybrid systems that we 
aware 
so, here is set 
i a ball 
h ground 
now, happens in between bounces 
well, newton tells that force is mass 
times acceleration and, 
acceleration is, in fact, g, g is 
gravitational constant 
so, if i let xh x equal to h 
dot, is we always do, 
i get is that x dot is this 
thing, x, is point 
mass, plus this gravitational force 
thats pulling 
now, lets say that thing that im 
interested in also is, ball 
actually is, high, high is, 
so y is going to x 
so, that is model ball 
happens bounces well, you 
could try to model ball deformations 
whatnot, that seems rather 
complicated so simply going to 
say is that whats called 
inelastic bouncers mean, 
means that a little bit energies 
sucked ball every time 
bounces 
in fact, going to say is 
that velocity, this is velocity, so 
if ball is coming here sound 
hits ground velocity 
instantaneously flips, means, thats 
we a minus sign there 
ball instantaneously flips 
also scaling this gamma constant, 
so making velocity change 
direction downwards to upwards, 
a little bit less, means we lost 
energy in bounce 
well, position doesnt change in 
bounce, so this means that reset 
condition is going to this 
this is encoding this fact that im 
flipping a little bit, im flipping 
velocity, im loosing a little bit 
energy time bounce 
alright, so lets see this bouncing 
ball hybrid automaton might look like 
well, x dot is axb, in this case, bu 
b is g so this is this forcing term 
that is gravity, big deal 
now, whats going to happen is im going 
to switch that mode to 
im bouncing 
we already saw that reset 
condition is this inelastic bounce 
condition that says that losing a 
little bit velocity time 
bounce 
so, thats reset condition 
now, guard condition is well, 
clearly, bouncing 
hitting ground 
so, we would like height to less 
equal to , right 
well, lets see happens 
here comes ball sound hits 
ground, height is , 
switching first thing we 
is we reverse velocity but, meaning, 
switching 
hey, wait a second, height is 
still less equal to 
height is still 
so, going to is 
going to end spinning like crazy if we 
this guard 
so, this is a good guard 
lets get rid 
instead, we need to is were, 
going to switch we come 
to ground velocity is 
pointing downwards 
meaning that h needs to negative 
less equal 
h dot to less equal , 
meaning, facing downwards 
since h h dot constitute 
state, guard really 
simply that x is less equal to 
thats guard condition 
well, could a, height 
is , this is really 
condition that tells us that time 
to, to switch okay, good 
so now, we that 
is this good 
well, i mean clearly, good 
pretty we guards 
resets 
model, first all, 
faithfully balls 
bounce secondly, there reasons 
a model like this would cause us to 
a little bit nervous to answer that, 
we need to figure ball is 
actually if we this model 
so, first all, we this system 

i would like to know is is 
output this system 
well, fast forward, sorry, forward, 
reverse two weeks we go back to 
linear timeinvariant systems 
we know solution to this system 
is 
we know that output is c times this 
bad boy here, that we call state 
transition matrix, fancy speak 
this matrix exponential times 
initial condition plus c times this 
rather awkwardlooking integral there 
now, is, is, is 
particularly pleasant 
i remember vividly we struggled 
to get this there so 
many integrals to keep track here 
now, in this particular case, a 
little bit lucky this a matrix is 
whats called nilpotent if i take 
a to power two, three, high 
there, higher exponential here, i 
get 
that turns to quite wonderful 
us 
is that well, remember, that eat is 
really this infinite sum 
a, there a parentheses here, i 
apologize 
to power k divided k 
well, in case, higher order 
equal to , so i get first k, 
gives identity matrix 
i get k, simply gives a 
times 
then, i others 
equal to 
so, eat, in this case, is simply this 
matrix 
here is part that comes 
adjacent matrix since a is simply 
that times t, i get here 
so, this is eat state 
transition matrix 
so now, i able to plug this 
back equation y get a 
rather nice looking expression 
so, lets that 
well, here is c 
here is state transition matrix 
heres initial condition 
heres this rather awkwardlooking 
differential equation sorry, integral 
now, we try to solve that 
if we that, instead actually 
math, 
i math, 
i encourage you to go home that 
im going to write 
solution is 
going to h times initial 
velocity, 
h dot tt thats minus g 
tt squared 
so, this is output looks like in 
between bounces 
good 
now, that we that, lets figure 
long takes in between bounces 
so, lets say that we start zero o 
clock, height zero 
this is bounce is to start 
then, sound we want to know 
long this, this took 
we want to know long took us to 
get back ground 
well, thats simple 
lets pick a big time, big say, 
well, y that time to equal to 
well, we plug that in 
h so we dont turn there we 
get h dot times minus this 
thing 
another way writing is like 
this 
you know what, this needs to equal 
to h is there h is 
there, 
is we two solutions 
so, one solution corresponds to t, 
is beginning bounce 
solution is we return 

so, this is long took to go 
ground, air, 
back to ground 
this is time in between bounces 
lets compute accumulated bounce 
times, 
we find amusing 
well, velocity beginning, so 
first time, lets say that 
velocity is v, 
right so then, time first 
bounce, instead h dot , i plug 
in v there 
i get vg, thats time first 
bounce 
well, velocity first 
bounce, 
well, reset condition says that i 
gamma times v, so okay, i a new 
v here 
thats im going to plug h 
dot here that immediately tells that 
time second bounce is, well, 
time first bounce plus 
time took second bounce 
instead v, i v divided 
gamma there 
so, thats long took to perform 
two bounces, so forth 
this tells that time nth 
bounce is given this vg is 
this term that shows 

then, every bounce gets this gamma to 
power k accumulated 
now, this is whats called a geometric 
series 
if you look that you happen to 
know it, if gamma is less one, 
means that youre adding energy 
bounce times, 
this thing will actually, okay, we 
gamma less one, 
this will actually converge in sense 
that n goes to infinity, this thing 
becomes equal to this expression 
well now, maybe you asking, 
so laugh well, you shouldnt 
asking so 
well, whats going there this is 
time takes to perform infinitely many 
bounces, 
infinitely many bounces, this is less 
infinity 
that means is this bouncing ball is 
going to go sound infinitely many 
there is time infinity here 
this system is going to grind 
to a halt model is going to 
keep computing bounce bounce 
bounce bounce faster faster 
faster 
this is actually a serious problem 
that causes system to actually crash 
so, ball bounces in infinite numbers 
times in finite time 
like i said, this is a 
mathematical curiosity that shows that we 
compute geometric series 
means that if im simulating it, 
simulation would crash 
in fact, i encourage you to write this 
exact model favorite simulator 
watch crash 
this also means that if i write 
hybrid system like this, 
undefined beyond infinity 
clear whats happening beyond there 
time is allowed to go to infinity 
so, stability, says happens 
goes to infinity sound you cant 
even ask that question doesnt 
go to infinity 
whats worse obviously is that real balls 
dont this, real balls bounce 
awhile lay still, right 
so, this is also an indication that 
model is particularly good 
and, in fact, this type phenomenon 
you infinitely many switches 
in finite time is known zeno 
phenomenon, philosopher zeno, 
that a tortoise race, a hare 
paradox that zeno came 
fact that hare never managed 
to overtake tortoise 
in next lecture, we will see, 
first all, tortoise is able to 
beat hare to it, 
meaning you make rabbit 
overtake turtle well, that, 
friends, is topic next 
lecture
