hi, welcome to glue lecture , control 
mobile robots 
im smriti chopra, instructor 
glue lectures 
this lecture is titled, hybrid 
automata 
so this week, dr egerstedt uh,introduced 
to 
you guys this concept hybrid control, 
right 
a system, in case, a robot, 

to go different behaviors in 
order to complete 
a task 
example go to goal, avoid obstacle, 
hop skip jump, whatever 
different behaviors in order to complete a 
task 
problem that is, 
problem, 
you need to keep in mind, is that 
suddenly we need a bigger model that 
takes 
account little models little 
behaviors robots 
we that 
we that something called a 
hybrid automata, 
takes account 
continuous dynamics, yet, 
switching logic, to switch between 
different dynamics different behaviors 
so basically, an example a hybrid 
automata is this 
guy here, really nothing a 
finite state machine 
a state machine is something that 
skips between different states, etc 
so we 
a q, example, is counter 
different states 
so q is , youre in this state 
q is , youre here 
q is , youre here 
mode, state, in 
different dynamics, x dots 
right 
different behaviors modes 
you guard conditions 
that tell 
you want to switch one mode to 
another 
pretty simple 
we 
we call resets 
is basically you switch to a 
different 
mode, you change state in way 

something you add 
automata 
so this is a simple example a 
hybrid automata looks like 
we while studying this hybrid 
automata, 
came across this phenomenon called zeno 
effect, right 
is that, 
really 
this annoying thing that makes 
state 
system kind go really fast between 
guard conditions 
so here guard, less , 
you go x dot f to f 
greater equal to , you 
switch back 
problem is equal to , 
you switch, 
you keep switching between 
two modes infinitely fast 
thats something we dont want in 
system 
this is called zeno phenomenon 
theres this whole thing called type 
zeno 
type zeno, is studied in 
lectures 
going to deal type zenoes, 
we know to deal 
type zenoes tough, 
going to 
deal here, in this class 
least 
an example is that, okay, youre given 
a system, 
right 
this is a simple system here two 
states, you want 
to see if this guy here is type zeno 

again, remember that this 
effect happens 
you have, lets say, guard 
condition, flipped, right 
so this g g, possible that 
you keep going between 
states really fast 
condition here, 
g x, is less , 
greater equal to , thats way 
you get this surface g x 
equal to , along youre going to 
keep moving like this, right 
okay 
so is going to type zeno 
this is first question you ask 
youre designing a system here 
you certain conditions 
conditions 
basically, you want to see is that 
this is surface g x equal to 
im hitting surface 
whichever direction im coming, either 
im coming greater equal to 
less , right 
whichever condition im coming from, 
i hit 
surface this particular equation hold 
true 
this particular condition 
hold true 
is simply saying that whenever 
i hit 
a surface, is true that one mode, 
f example, is pulling in one 
direction, 
f is pulling in 
direction 
thats encoded in this condition here 
so always true 
so thats you want to check is 
going to 
true that im pulled different 
directions i hit 
surface, is g x equal to 
okay, so this is pretty simple 
you guys saw derivation in class, etc 
this is true, you 
determine that 
yes, is a type zeno, you 

okay, you dont want to keep moving 
infinitely fast along surface, right 
instead you want to is you want to 
slide along surface 
so we found that is type 
zeno, going to try induce 
sliding mode instead 
going back forth really fast so 
that, you know, 
we kind remove this whole annoying 
thing zeno effect 
so we this example that we saw 
we want to find out, first 
thing, is this in fact type zeno 
not, right 
we saw that we need to this check 
to ensure if type zeno 
this check is pretty simple, g 
effect equal to , 
see if this condition holds not, 
going to that 
so we know g x equal to gives us x 
equal to , right 
lead derivative, lfg, is 
really nothing 
partial derivative g respect 
to x times f 
g x is x minus , 
partial derivative g 
respect to x is going to 
times f, is f 
is minus x, right 
okay 
we want to make sure that 
new derivative is negative, in f 
direction, right 
so in order to this expression 
negative, we 
find that x must greater 
in way, math, you 
check 
this condition, gives you x 
greater 
so you three things here x is 
equal 
to , x greater , x greater 
you want to see if this makes sense 

will this situation ever occur, right 
turns out, course will occur, 
x equal to automatically means 
x is greater , x is greater 

so that means i hit surface, i 
in fact going to experience zer, zeno 
effect 
so we established that 
okay 
so yeah, x is equal to 
kind make sure that 
that means that we must in fact 
sliding control 
we hit surface, we dont 
want to keep moving 
infinitely fast along that surface, we 
want to slide smoothly along surface 
so we to sliding control 
okay 
so in general form, this is looks 
like 
thing is, you find that is 
type 
zeno, that there will zeno effect, 
what, right 
youve hit surface 
you know that this is zeno effect 
you going to 
you need to move along that surface 
to move along that surface, you need 
to know dynamics, right 
you need to know x dot 

i moving along surface 
so thats this log diagram here 
shows 
this guy in particular is dynamics 
x 
dot that you employ in order to move along 
surface 
way you get this is taking 
time derivative guard condition, 
setting to 
logic behind that is you 
want to move this line, gx equal 
to , obviously you want to stay 
here g is , 
you, you going to say that time 
derivative g is also 
theres change g is going to stay 
constant 
thats whole intuition behind 
you get x dot 
actual derivation is there in 
lectures, so you 
guys can, you know, go refer to 
stuff 
im giving you formula here, 
im 
telling you you actually get 
setting dg 
dt equal to zero 
okay, lets go back to sliding 
mode dynamics cough find 
so we know that this system, we 
already 
found guy is going to zeno 
effects, right 
so im going to find sliding mode 
dynamics this equation right here 
there two ways 
one is pretty much i told you, that i 
know 
going to type zeno, so im 
going to set dg dt equal to 
again, g x is x minus 
so dg dt is going to really x 
dot, right 
i set x dot equal to , well 
guess what, i got dynamics 
so i means i hit sliding surface, 
i stop x dot is 
i velocity 
i nothing 
i pretty much stop 
okay 
then, theres another way it, 
if you dont want to go this 
thats pretty much solving 
this expression here 
so you actually compute little guys, 
derivatives, we 
done, way, plug 
this equation 
you get x dot 
so remember lfg f 
lfg f, so you put this 
stuff this guy, this becomes ff 
minus ff, 
is 
so you get x dot equal to 
so ways we saw that we get 
dynamics, x dot equal to 
that really whole point 
this slide, to show you how, 
given a system, first you find if 
zeno type zeno 
lets say i tell you type zeno, 

you find sliding mode 
dynamics 
so together happens is, okay, 
ive got this new mode 
here, i need to somehow connect it, 
right, to initial system 
so this is pretty simple 
i know that i hit surface, im 
going to go sliding mode, 
whichever mode im in 
im transitioning, i hit x equal to 
i come sliding mode, then, 
course, i 
get it, sliding mode, i 
come back 
states 
if youre wondering, you know, 
you come well 
in this case x dot is , so maybe youre 
going to grind to a halt 
there times where, you know, 
x dot is 
you continuously moving, 
condition, you remember that lfg 
condition , less , 
something else greater 
basically vectors 
pointing opposite 
so while moving, if point 
vectors stop pointing opposite directions, 
start 
pointing in direction, etc, 
suddenly 
you dont experience zeno effect that 
point, right 
thats dynamics 
going to 
push you sliding mode, 
youre going to get 
come back to guys here 
so this is a general form 
okay 
that, keep checking forums, good 
luck quiz , byebye
