hi, im smirti chopra again, im 
instructor 
glue lectures duration 
this course 
this is glue lecture two, lets get 

this lecture is titled robot models, 
this week you 
guys focused a lot different models 
robots specifically 
usual pay attention this 
lecture will 
help you guys quiz two okay, 
that 
so, we saw this week in dr unknown 
lectures that introduced two models 
robots 
thats robot, one model 
respect to, you know, angular 
velocities wheels robot, 
is differential right model 
another model that we saw 
respect to sine v omega 
inputs 
so two different models are, 
why, is that you know, we a 
one model thats actually angular 

model thats b go 
well, went it, explained to 
you guys that, 
you know, this differential drive model, 
is actually one that is 
used robot, actually model 

robot, a twowheel differential 
drive thing is 
important 
implementing controller onto 
robot you to use correct 
model 
to two wheels, so obviously you 
need 
to give inputs with, 
wheels 
we designing controller 
we designing controls, in 
that time we dont want to, you know, 
think in terms wheel velocities etc, 
wed rather 
think in terms of, you know, okay, 
walking 
im walking a linear velocity 
an angular 
velocity, kind much easier 
than, you know, 
thinking wheel 
turns, et cetera 
so we two models here, 
differential 
drive simpler model, is used 
design 
okay, so i want to show you guys this 
model in action, 
you know, this whole thing you 
design controllers based 
different model you use something 
else implementation 
thats 
watch this video, a really 
interesting video 
work 
robots playing music 
theyre playing beethovens fur elise, 
actually 
point here that i want to make is that 
music 
control that is designed this 
visual box is done using 
model, simplified model that we saw, 
v omega model, you 
implementing onto robots 
actually converting v omega into, you 
know, angular velocities robot 

that is input that getting 
sound here 
so in inaudible a differential 
drive robot, 
thats what, we 
okay, so, you that 
if you really simplify see, this 
robot, basically im saying 
is, you know, you go point a to point 
b in time ten seconds 
this is a simple thing youll, here, this 
this point 
playing note a piano here 
playing 
g sharp something, lets say, 
floor piano 
needs to go here to here in 
ten seconds 
that is basic problem one robot if 
you really simplify 
okay 
this is model im using, like i said, 
to 
calculate v omega to make 
actually this 
thats however whatever trajectory 

take, straight line, move like this, 
whatever 
this input that i giving 
is based model shown here 
choose high level task 
control design is done here 
cmd that i going to 
sending to 
robots going to found using this 
model is differential model 
you guys seen this 
okay, happens is you use this 
guy this guy together, 
you actually derive solutions 
so im saying is that, 
im going to find v comma omega based 
this guy 
im going to convert put 

this equation here to get v r v 
l 
is im going to send to 
robots 
that is exactly you saw in that, 
music playing robots thing well 
so okay that is one well another 
an intuitive example, lets go really 
quick 
lets say 
velocity input that im giving to robot 
is zero omega 
angular velocity is constant, 
corresponding angular wheel 
velocities 
so again, v omega is i found 
i send commands 
to robots, im going to find vr vl 
using equations right here 
right 
so, you plug this stuff in, you see 
that vr is going to this value here 
vl is going 
to this value here 
c is constant is 
actually omega 
okay, intuitively, you understand 
whats happening here 
lets see that robot lets units 
point im saying that 
you know going straight 
going to keep moving you 
know like im saying 
velocity is zero 
omega is constant so i a constant 
angular velocity, okay that means that 
robot is moving forward, 
spinning in place 
that makes sense 
weve found out, 
in terms of, you know, right left 
wheel angular velocities 
one, is simply negative 
so one wheel is getting, lets say, plus 
five is getting negative 
five 
so theyre going to, going to make 
robot spin in place 
going to make go forward 

so that whole intuitive example 
basically you guys pretty 
comfortable 
going between this,you know, mapping 
transformation, v unknown to v r u 
okay, that, im back to musical 
bot 
so you guys remember this 
course you do, happened two slides 
ago 
this musical bot example rova to 
go a to b in, lets see, ten seconds 
i want to go a little deeper 
control 
so earlier we, we showed mapping 
between, you know, v omega 
vr vlv, assume that somehow magically 
i really v omega, right 
i want to go a little deeper say 
okay 
this whole finding control v 
omega 
based model that i said 
how, actually mean 
this is model i 
im asking you guys this 
that sound lets make really simple 
robot is here looking also in 
this direction 
okay 
needs to go here to here 
lets say even theta is perfect 
already looking here 
wakes a 
needs to reach it, seconds 
so cant i say 
guess 
omega zero 
v be, b minus a 
right 
we know us know physics, 
geometry 
model et cetera, that if i to give 
robot 
this velocity, this omega, 
every time instant 
seconds, i can, ill in fact reach this 
point, here 
simple maths, right 
so dont we that 
we make a big deal about, oh, 
we to design control v, omega et 
cetera, like 
is this robot is actually 
in that music video that we saw 
etcetera 
well answer is 

we dont live in a perfect world 
so in world simulation this would 
perfect, 
yeah sure, in computer in my, you 
know 
mind, works perfectly, actually 
i put 
onto robots, whats going to happen is 
there will friction 
there will problems 
maybe wheels dont move 
rate that 
maybe encoders slightly 
off, maybe 
i come kick robot while 
moving 
whatever 
i need to know that lets say while im 
moving here i wear slightly 
v omega this point needs to know 
that i gone path 
in words we need to feedback, 
if there is feedback 
i in world then, so easy 
to veer 
of, you know, problems like 
friction, etc 
im actually moving robot 

v omega idea that i want to 
so lets say while walking i come here, 
ill keep going straight instead 
im kind, kind you know, 
feedback on, i moving 
so this, i think this a key concept 
in 
controls that kind motivates 
is that 
we need state information we need 
feedback even 
stuff that you studied you know, 
pid regulators, pi everything 
you minimizing error you need 
feedback, 
you need output, you need to know 
you 
in order to find even error, 
far you from, you need to 

this feedback is a important 
thing that you need 
so hopefully this, i kind 
explained to you guys, motivation 
behind 
you need to know you in 
world 
you saw in lectures dr 
edgarson 
goes this whole thing wheel 
encoders, right 
if you wheel encoders you 
will to measure you 
okay, that real quick 
this is wheel encoder works 
encoder n ticks, a total n 
ticks that 
means if you haul n ticks you would 
moved one revolution 
wheel is two pi r on, you 
know, distance, you dl, 
dr, dc 
is dl, dr, dc is basically much 
wheel is moving 
much distance distance this arc, 
example, based number ticks 
so that i got ticks much i 
move 
is this distance 
that is given dl, dr, dc 
dc is this 
you see this okay 
we this this is you know, 
wheel encoders 
give us what, we find we 
in space 
okay, i know i in beginning 
lets say i this is i wake 
i use dl, dr, dc in this form, in this 
update equation 
i get new position x prime, y 
prime, v prime 
remember, x, y, v is state, 
i in place, 
like x, y, looking there 
that kind a thing 
okay, cool 
so this whole thing is wheel encoders 
this is work 
so general you know, 
knowledge curiosity 
if you wondering this model 
come from, 
well we could go back to our, you know 
concepts 
in physics really quick we could 
like, right 
if this is a circle, if this is walking 
circle radius small r here 
i a speed lets say, you know, 
v, linear speed 
well, i must angular velocity, 
right 
b to walking this circle 
otherwise, i would keep walking 
straight 
so variables, kind you 
know, match 
so, there is this famous formula we 
use, omega r, that kind 
relates fact that if somebody is 
walking if you tracking this point 
a circle radius r, 
linear velocity, 
is v, angular velocity, is 
omega relate to one another 
if i wanted to see much 
distance 
i moved in lets say time delta t, well, 
im 
simply going to is im going to say, 
multiply this 
speed, distance becomes 
omega r delta 
thats distance 
i 
want you guys to like, kind understand 
that concept 
thought in terms the, 
wheel robot 
so if angular velocity wheel 
is vr radius is r, i actually 
calculate distance moved r times vr 
times dt 
here, im going to let you guys 
figure 
is that well reach this model 
hence, im going to say, okay, we 
already found we got this 
we know this model robot 
we something to you know, 
kind 
get this equation using update law 
that we 
know that if we ever want to find 
position 
next time is we simply say 
position 
previous plus x dot time 
so a nice exercise find we 
get this model then, is good 
that lets go to next example 
so this is an odometry example 
to kind you know make 
really clear concept wheelencoders 
important quiz 
so lets 
say robot starts origin 
i say origin, i mean position 
orientation zero 
is located seconds 
you to find 
now, is 
is given that left wheel 
right wheel 
car, takes left wheel 
car six ticks, blablabla 
stuff is given 
will you 
okay 
set equations that you 
going to use 
first, you know numbers 
ticks, youre going to 
find much wheel moved 
based equations right here, 
right 
youre going to use in this 
update law 
to find finally x, y, 
pi land 
a real quick note 
satisfaction here is that 
nice to wonder if im robot, 
if i robot, i 
know input im giving it, i know 
angular velocities im giving it, right 
so cant i find 
model, is 
this, right, this guy here, dont i 
find 
updating using this next position 
is going to based vr vl 
is that 
that im using encoder in first 
place like dont 
i simulate based inputs 
im going to in 
time insteasd 
well, thats exactly point that 
trying to make here that even though im 
giving a certain input, i dont know 
that actually going to that 
so i update equation, i dont want 
to based solely model 
i actually want to get feedback, physical 
feedback 
robot, thats i want to update 
equation 
thats we this whole in quarter 
thing instead 
simply saying, you know 
im going to find 
update equation i know inaudible 
im going to find x, y, 
z line 
no, thats we dont want to this 
we want feedback 
we want to see if actually translated 
that much motion 
thats we use inaudible 
that, we will in this lecture 
good luck quiz two 
keep checking forums 
bye bye
