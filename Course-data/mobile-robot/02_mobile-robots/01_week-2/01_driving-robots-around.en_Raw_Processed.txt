so, welcome to module course, 
control mobile robots in module , we 
introduced control theory a way 
dealing systems in general 
in this module, going to introduce 
mobile robots key target 
application course 
going to is start a simple 
question i drive a robot 
point a to point b, in this case a 
blue ball to a yellow sun first 
question we need to understand we 
even answer to drive is 
we need well obviously, we need to 
measure sun is goal point 
is, somehow turn this control 
actions so, weve taken information 
sun feeding 
controller so, one things we need 
is to design controller we kind 
know a little bit already we 
also need to understand information 
robot actually so, going to 
to discuss a little bit 
robots actually gain information 
world and, course, that, we need 
sensors so, we need to discuss sensor 
models sufficient level 
abstraction so that we reason 
them, need to rich enough so 
that we trust that information 
that controller is based on, is 
actually something that robot 
finally, in order controllers 
to useful, we need to able to 
basically predict theyre going to 
influence robot so, going to 
need models so, im going to in 
this module is to discuss robot models 
and, in particular, going to look 
differential drive robot mobile robots 
going to discuss sensors 
going to look sensors that allow us to 
gain information world around us 
sensors that allow us to know 
something internal state 
instance, is robot we will 
is advanced perception 
going to look abstracted 
sensor models that give us type of, 
infor mation that we want we 
even that, whenever you try to design 
controllers robots that drive around 
in world, there two facts that you 
really to embrace first is 
that world is fundamentally unknown 
youre going to know every chair 
in building is youre going to 
know every tree in forest is 
youre driving in forest so, 
theres way you plan in advance 
exactly robot 
second is, people move chairs people 
move around wind makes trees blow , 
sway 
so, world is actually changing 
dynamic that reason, also a 
bad idea to try to produce, in advance, a 
complicated monolithic controller 
everything so instead, we 
in robotics, a lot times, is we divide 
control task chunks 
well design controllers 
individual chunks so, instance, if 
im a robot trying to get to a goal, i may 
kind controller thats taking 
to goal something 
shows in environment, i switch to 
another controller that allows to avoid 
that thing in environment and, in 
fact primitive building blocks that 
point view different 
controllers, in robotics, theyre called 
behaviors so, behaviors going to 
key concepts in this course 
going to design quite a few i 
want to mention a handful 
standard behaviors that we will indeed 
see gotogoal is basic one, 
means drive to a, a waypoint 
target location avoidobstacles is 
absolutely crucial meaning, dont slam 
things way there if 
youre in, you know, an office 
environment, you know that world is 
typically straight lines, walls, so 
followwall is a bad type behavior 
to if goal is moving, you may 
want to track instead going to 
static goal, so forth, so forth 
well see quite a few different 
beha viors 
i would like to start a video 
here a robot that i developing 
working on, that used camera information 
to build a map world looked 
like here is robot is 
based a planner heres, 
seeing something kind putting 
in map thinking a 
new long plan to, robot to take 
so basically, you saw robot spending 
a, a large amount time dealing new 
information to replan so 
now, running to exact thing 
behaviors so, following a plan 
just, in fact, follow plan behavior 
something pops up, 
switching to an avoidobstacle behavior 
so now, things is in 
the, shows to robot instead 
robot sitting around thinking a 
long time, avoids 
clear, goes back to following the, 
the, plan so, this would an 
example behaviors really 
useful here is another example this is 
actually a segway robot, so dynamics 
is complicated never mind the, 
moving graphs in lower, lower part 
picture i want you to see is 
that this robot is actually, in this case, 
switching between different arc behaviors 
so, there different arcs that 
robot take behaviors, in this 
case, follow various arcs so now, you 
put behaviors that simple 
gotogoal instead, 
behaviors would arcs various sizes 
shapes we will become quite good 
understanding to design 
individual behaviors, well, to 
combine
