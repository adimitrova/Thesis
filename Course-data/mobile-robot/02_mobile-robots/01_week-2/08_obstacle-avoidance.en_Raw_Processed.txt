so we feel pretty confident abut 
ability to design controllers that take a 
robot to a goal location in fact weve 
seen in design, weve seen in 
simulation, weve even seen in real 
life we discussed issue 
well if robot needs to 
something slightly elaborate 
get to point instance you 
typically dont want to hit things 
way there so one behavior that i 
want to talk a little bit is 
obstacle avoidance goal to goal 
obstacle avoidance really 
dynamic duo mobile robatics ,, 
going to things, course 
underneath hood, there will always 
a goal to goal, an obstacle avoidance 
behavior lets think a little bit 
one avoid driving 
obstacles going to goal location 
particularly complicated 
well, we clearly use idea 
we in gotogoal defining a desired 
heading, simply, you know, steer 
in that direction so, lets say that we 
following robot, well, 
blue ball we this 
little red c, is obstacle, 
located xo yo reason that we 
know location this is the, 
disc obstraction we talked about, 
we talked sensors okay, if this 
is a goal, we would steer towards that 
much is clear, now, question is if 
is an obstacle direction we 
steer it, clear i mean, 
here is a direction we go in you 
know, lets run away obstacle 
thats a little overly cautious i 
think least sometimes, if im even 
m way towards the, red thing 
a sudden i to insist 
going opposite direction so this is 
one direction we go in, 
seems a little, i put 
seems a little skittish, paranoid we 
able to a little bit 
clever, maybe like this so if going 
in this general direction, we 
maybe go perpendicular to the, 
direction to obstacle thats one way 
in we could thinking there 
choices we could make lets say 
that we a goal again, 
avoiding obstacles, actually trying 
to go somewhere this obstacle red 
obstacle we see here well, doesnt 
seem to matter if im going towards 
goal, i care that obstacle 
so, hey we could ignore thats 
one direction we could go in we could 
somehow combine direction to goal 
way avoiding an obstacle so, 
we could kind move away 
obstacle while somewhat getting towards 
to goal 
point here is that there is obvious 
correct answer, going to goal clear 
direction we want to go in 
avoiding an obstacle 
clear, obvi, obviously to go 
in this direction we choices 
choices better 
others so lets, lets look 
choices that we a little bit 
okay 
so we robot in blue, we 
obstacle in red we goal in 
yellow this choice one pi is, im 
going to call pi obst plus pi so pi 
obst is this angle, right so, here is phi 
obst in fact, pi obst is we write 
arc tangent y obst minus y x 
obst minus x so this is way in 
we compute angle to obstacle 
we say well pi suggestion one 
is super paranoid robot 
whos avoiding obstacles cost, 
adding pi to mix way 
i adding pi, subtracting pi 
right, so, heres the, the, angle 
i want to go to the, this is phi obst 
and, im is adding pi 
right, so, this is , well point is 
that actually doesnt matter if you add 
pi, subtract pi, we know 
that angles slightly scary objects 
and, we always take something like r 
tangents too, to ensure that we stay 
within minus pi pi adding pi 
subtrac ting pi long we take 
safety measures, doesnt matter so, we 
thing doesnt matter 
one we choose but, thats one way 
now, this direction is pure in sense 
that i dont care goal is i 
going to move away obstacle 
much i so, im going to call 
this pure avoidance notion 
im supposed to going well, we 
another choice, right we said, if we 
go perpendicularly to this direction 
well, so pi is pi obstacle plus minus 
pi well, that mean means 
that if i minus pi , i go in this 
direction if i plus pi , i go in 
that direction there, here 
actually matters if i plus minus 
question is, one we 
choose well, typically that depends 
goal is so we pick in 
this case minus pi that 
moves us closer to goal, while plus pi 
moves us away 
goal punchline here is really 
that this is a pure strategy, 
we need to know goal is 
instead, is 
actually, im calling blended in, in, 
in sense that taking 
direction to goal account we 
figuring in direction we 
going so a pure 
obstacle avoidance if i ask you to 
avoid an obstacle, you say i cant, 
needs to know goal 
is in that sense, pure so, 
thats one choice well, remember this 
one we said, you know this obstacle 
is big deal to us, we simply 
going to go in direction goal 
well, this is pure goal to goal 
running one behavior goal to goal, 
we dont care obstacle 
whats interesting is this choice, fi 
is really a combination 
direction to goal direction to 
obstacle interesting thing 
here is that this is clearly a blended 
mechanism, somehow we combining go to 
goal, type oyds obstacl e avoidance 
ideas punch line here is that 
there really two fundamentally 
different ways combining, avoiding 
slimming interstuff getting to goal 
points ways combining things 
is called an arbitration mechanism so we 
saw typically in this case two 
fundamentally different arbitration 
mechanisms one is winner takes 
approach is a hard switch 
going straight away obstacle 
right so here obstacle here 
robot robot going there 
avoid obstacles or, if 
goal here, right going 
straight to goal, go 
to goal so, would two examples 
hard switches now, two 
examples we saw blended behaviors 
one was, youre combining somehow, 
angle to goal angle to 
obstacle to produce a new desired angle 
first blended behavior we saw 
one kind moving 
perpendicularly to obstacle, 
in a way that getting 
closer to goal two 
valid ways designing arbitration 
mechanisms in fact, we going to 
to get systematic careful 
to i point that 
approaches merit nice 
thing winner takes is that 
if go to goal is going to goal, 
i analyze that if obstacle avoidance 
is avoiding obstacles i 
analyze that, means that an 
analysis point view easier to deal 
hard switches however, 
necessarily case that a 
performance point view hard switches 
to preferred because, seems 
like im walking around im kind 
keeping an eye im going while 
slamming things so im 
either going towards something avoiding 
slamming things so seems like 
performance wise, blending smoothing 
two behaviors makes a lot sense 
however, an analysis point view 
harder so, question is ho w 
you design system in a way that 
you cake eat meaning 
you analyze whats going you 
still good performance so, we 
going to to bite this bullet head on, 
in fact we would systematic 
we done in this module, 
module two is simply introduce mobile 
robots weve looked basic models 
we looked basic ways in 
getting information world 
we designed basic behaviors, 
to honest, we havent particularly 
careful we module one, we 
also particularly careful, 
there focus control theory so 
mobile, mo, , module three is enough chit 
chat let actually start this course in a 
systematic formal matter so, 
going to return to module one in 
module three going to 
return to module two going to 
see, we we did, in a 
rather heuristic ad hoc manner in a 
systematic formal way 
way to is to go to wonderful 
abstraction that is linear systems theory 
so, that is focus next module
