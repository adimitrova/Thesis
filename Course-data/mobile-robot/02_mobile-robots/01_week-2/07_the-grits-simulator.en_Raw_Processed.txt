so, you control design you always 
a number parameters that need to 
tweaked tuned theres really 
way selecting parameters 
without actually testing whats going 
so, we seen to design goal to 
goal behaviors we havent really 
picked parameters in pid regulator 
so, going to is take 
we done actually simulate 
that, going to use 
inhouse grits robot simulator, is a 
matlabbased simulator based a 
khepera inaudible differential drive 
mobile robots infrared range sensors 
around it, so detect things in 
environment odometry is obtained using 
wheel encoders i point 
that i will using this simulator quite 
a lot in this course you actually 
download free this address 
you either download a standalone 
executable, means youll able to 
run interact user 
interface, you download entire 
matlab package now, i will require 
that you use if course, if you 
want to play around different control 
designs a robot, this is a good 
simulator to start so, lets 
actually see would so, im 
going to move to matlab start 
simulator going to see 
here is, this is robot, pointing 
in direction i placed a goal 
negative , so going to go 
backwards in this direction to get to 
goal so, lets see actually 
so, im going to start playing 
this robot is turning, turning and, 
you see here, blue line is the, 
is actual heading dotted line, 
red line, is desired heading 
here, we quite a bit overshoot 
so, this is a particularly good 
control sign actually thats going 
overshooting even though we 
seem to stabilizing towards 
direction in we want to go so, 
instead going in this direction, let 
s, lets see if we something better 
to the, control parameters so, im 
going to open file we define 
pid controller so, i a p gain, a 
proportional gain , an integral gain 
d gain well, integral 
gain seems rather excessive to 
so, im rather brutally going to say, 
dont we make caring 
getting exactly there so, lets turn 
to zero actually see 
happens so, if we that close this 
window here, this window, lets see 
happens, lets start 
well, now, lets, lets start 
simulator now, go to 
negative , hopefully, well we 
will cured robot annoying 
overshoot look this step response 
see desired heading goes to, 
actual heading goes to desired 
heading quite nicely stabilizes 
to we wanted so now, in simulation, 
we verified that this particular 
choice control parameters is, is 
least entirely useless is a 
good way to start you actually go 
a real robot so now, lets stop this 
simulation business move to 
actual robot so, that weve seen 
to think control design building 
a go to goal behavior, we even 
simulated varying degrees 
success, lets actually put an 
actual robot so, im here again, jp, 
is master ceremony a 
khepera differential drive mobile robot 
going to running exactly 
code we in simulator 
is flipping a switch so 
actually running robot instead 
simulator this differential 
drive robot will know is based 
solely edometric information 
getting wheel encoders, 
task is, is to make here to 
this turquoise gold point here a 
simple pid regulator is enforced 
going to use parameters in 
simulation a p , an i gain 
a d gain , so a pure 
pregulator without ado, jp, 
lets see computer ,, , 
you see turn nice, there 
few little oscillation here 
khepera is making nicely 
way to turquoise goal point 
so, we will call that a success
