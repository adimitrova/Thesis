so recall, last time, we saw that we 
designed a controller that nice 
smooth didnt overreact to small 
errors made a system stable yet didnt 
achieve tracking this 
proportional regulator, p 
regulator lets return to 
performance objectives a little bit weve 
talked briefly a 
controller minimum 
stabilize system if doesnt 
that, we know nothing ive written 
this rather awkward looking acronym here, 
bibo, is something lord 
rings almost stands 
is, bounded in, bounded means 
that if control signal is bounded, 
state system also 
bounded this means is that, 
reasonable things system 
doesnt blow system doesnt 
that tracking means we get to 
reference value we want robustness 
means we shouldnt to know much 
parameters that we really 
way knowing preferably we 
able to fight noise well, so recall 
this model i 
introduced this wind resistant term here, 
we a little bit a problemthe 
proportional regulator couldnt overcome 
lets another controller done 
one that explicitly cancels effect 
wind resistance so here is 
attempt , im going to use this part, 
is proportional part that we 
already talked about, im going 
to add this thing is plus gamma 
mcx 
well i this well, i this 
following reason that if you reach 
steady state x is equal to , 
you get is well this p part 
this is controller, p controller 
effect this thing well 
youre going to multiply this cm 
youre going get is plus gamma x 
you wind resistance is 
negative gamma x so gamma x, bad 
parts cancel in fact 
left is that x to equal 
to r so, voila, weve sol ved 
problem 
we perfect tracking or, we 
dom, dom, dom no, we and, 
is this well, we stability we 
tracking, we dont 
robustness here three things that we 
dont know gamma, m, c 
controller depends explicitly on, 
coefficients so a sudden we 
to know physical parameters that 
we dont know, so this is a robust 
control design so attempt is a failure 
okay, lets go back to pregulator 
see whats going there what, whats 
actually happening is that 
proportional error is a fine job 
pushing system to close to 
be, but, kind runs 
steam, cant push hard enough to 
overcome effect wind 
resistance so proportional thing 
isnt hard enough, take a look here 
this is error, error starts 
accumulating time, so if we somehow, 
if able to collect 
errors time, even though 
small time, that 
enough, so that we use this 
accumulated error to push way 
so i wish there way collecting 
things time in a plot like this and, 
course, there there is, this is 
something called an integral so, if we 
take integral error 
collecting error time 
time this errors going to accumulate 
going to give us enough pushing power 
to actually overcome wind resistance 
so attempt is a pi regulator 
so i here is error time 
this is kp, is proportional 
gain so this is p part that we 
already saw now, im adding an 
integral that is integrating error 
beginning to current time 
collecting this we 
another term here, another coefficient 
ki, i stands integral 
part so this a pi regulator is 
common regulator found 
anywhere in world, in fact 
almos commercial grade cruise 
controllers so if i a p an i, 
could possibly missing to get to 
instead 
well, we take a derivative right, we 
proportion, we integral, we 
a derivative so, produce whats 
called a pidregulator so we a 
proportional term a proportional 
gain we an integral part an 
integral gain we a 
derivative part a derivative gain, so 
this is an extremely useful 
controller that shows a lot and, in 
fact, im going to hand, to hand 
a big sweetheart to pid regulator 
an important type 
control structure that shows 
time in fact going to get quite 
good designing pid regulators 
said that, i draw hearts i 
want, lets see in action see 
actually if i use pi 
regulator, even a d component to 
cruise controller, a sudden i 
get something thats getting quickly, 
nice slowly, i mean smoothly, to 
miles per hour, is reference so 
this solves problem i dont know 
parameters, so robust im achieving 
tracking, im getting to miles 
per hour and, im stable in sense 
that i didnt crash so, this seems like a 
useful design
