hello welcome to first programming 
simulation lecture 
i jp, i excited to introduce 
program, programming assignments in 
this course to you 
since this course is controlling 
mobile robots, progra, programming 
assignments will 
focus applying you learn 
lectures to simulated mobile robots 
therefore we will using math lab based 
robot simulator called unknown, 
important you to know that weekly 
assignments entirely optional 
meaning that factor 
course grade however you 
option to submit one 
assignments feedback 
since programming exercises 
completely optional, let take a 
moment to convince you worth 
time effort 
first all, a unique 
opportunity to apply you learn in 
this 
course to a interesting problem 
in this case, safely navigating a 
mobile robot 
a cluttered environment is a super 
exciting problem to solve 
second all, you will learn matlab, 

is a powerful tool engineer 
a bonus, if you build draw in 
quickbot in this, thats built in this 
course, everything that you write in 

programming assignments directly 
tested this robot 
hopefully, thats enough to convince you 
to start 
programming assignments, so lets 
get started 
programming assignment number one 
objective this first assignment is 
to get comfortable matlab to run 
simulator least 
we included detailed instructions 
this assignment in a section called 
programming assignments you find 
this directly course page 
if already familiar matlab 
best described 
numerical computing environment a 
programming language 
since we will using matlab extensively 
in this course, in programming 
assignments 
youll access to a license matlab 
duration course 
in fact, this license wont expire until a 
few week, weeks 
course ends, will plenty time 
to complete assignments 
detailed installation instructions 

found in aforementioned programming 
assignment section 
well links to resources learning 
key matlab concepts that youre 
going to needing, that youre going to 
need to complete assignments 
reason that using matlab in 
programming 
assignments is that weve developed a 
simulator mobile 
robots in matlab 
simulator emulates quickbot 

this robot a two wheel differential 
drive, five infrared sensors, two 
wheel encoders 
programming assignments 
based 
simulator will require you to, 
for, example, 
write a go to go controller 
quickbot 
that drives point a to point b 
to help you in this endeavor, weve 
included a detailed user manual 
that will help you implement test 
code 
if you choose to receive feedback 
solutions weve designed a user interface 
that 
in fact here is a screenshot this 
this application 
you is you enter submission 
log in password, here 
you select parts 
assignment you would like to graded 
example, you might want to grade this 
part, 
this part 
so you check first one 
youre ready to submit, you hit 
submit 
to coursera grading, grading 
button right here 
will happen is that a script will 
start simulator, well 
code to gather output compare 
output to values stored coursera 
servers 
if output matches with, is 

coursera server, you will get a check 
mark 
this 
part assignment 
if not, you will get an x 
that means youve gotten credit 
this part assignment 
however, dont worry 
you will get feedback you might 
want 
to change in order to get correct 
solution 
you may resubmit many times you 
want 
until you get a hundred percent 
parts 
remember that points earned in 
this assignment will 
count towards grade, this is 
really a great opportunity 
to get feedback solutions 
so lets see that in action in matlab 
this is matlab 
here you see command window, to 
left is current folder 
ive done is ive downloaded zip 
simulator this week 
ive unzipped browsed to this 
location 
here files simulator 
if you want to launch simulator you 
simply type launch command window 

hit enter 
this brings simulator, along 
this cute swatch screen, swatch screen 
right here 
along a few instructions to 
use simulator 
you hit play 
simulation starts 
you see quick boat in center, 

i zoom in zoom using 
buttons 
you see quick boat two 
wheels, five infrared sensors 
infrared sensors in blue 
detecting obstacles, 
ones in red detecting this red 
obstacle right here 
we also pen around see that there 
several obstacles 
example, walls here in 
environment 
time you click robot robot 
will centered screen you 
you also pause resume 
simulation time 
restart entire, entire simulation 
clicking home button 
youre ready to submit, you type in 
submit 
this will bring submission window 
again, here are, is login password 
for, submission coursera 
this weeks assignment one part 
to is to run simulator 
weeks you might to 
three different parts to complete 
i hit submit to coursera grading, 
simulator pop 
close, close 
entire assignment to run 
simulator 
you see, ive done that, so 
ive gotten a check mark this 
assignment 
if you questions, issues, bugs, 
concerns, please create 
a post in discussion forums 
programming assignments section 
make sure to include enough 
information 
us fellow students to help you 
that, i wish you good luck
