hello
and
welcome
to
the
first
programming
and
simulation
lecture
.
i
am
jp
,
i
am
very
excited
to
introduce
the
program
,
programming
assignments
in
this
course
to
you
.
since
this
course
is
about
controlling
mobile
robots
,
the
progra
,
programming
assignments
will
focus
on
applying
what
you
learn
on
the
lectures
to
simulated
mobile
robots
.
therefore
we
will
be
using
math
lab
based
robot
simulator
called
[
unknown
]
,
and
its
important
for
you
to
know
that
the
weekly
assignments
are
entirely
optional
.
meaning
that
they
do
not
factor
into
your
course
grade
however
you
have
the
option
to
submit
each
one
of
the
assignments
for
feedback
.
since
these
programming
exercises
are
completely
optional
,
let
me
take
a
moment
to
convince
you
why
they
are
worth
your
time
and
effort
.
first
of
all
,
they
are
a
very
unique
opportunity
to
apply
what
you
learn
in
this
course
to
a
interesting
problem
.
in
this
case
,
it
's
safely
navigating
a
mobile
robot
through
a
cluttered
environment
which
is
a
super
exciting
problem
to
solve
.
second
of
all
,
you
will
learn
matlab
,
which
is
a
very
powerful
tool
for
any
engineer
.
and
as
a
bonus
,
if
you
build
draw
in
quickbot
in
this
,
that
's
built
in
this
course
,
then
everything
that
you
write
in
the
programming
assignments
can
be
directly
tested
on
this
robot
.
hopefully
,
that
's
enough
to
convince
you
to
start
with
the
programming
assignments
,
so
let
's
get
started
with
.
programming
assignment
number
one
and
the
objective
for
this
first
assignment
is
to
get
comfortable
with
matlab
and
to
run
the
simulator
at
least
once
.
we
have
included
detailed
instructions
for
this
assignment
in
a
section
called
programming
assignments
and
you
can
find
this
directly
on
our
course
page
.
if
your
not
already
familiar
with
matlab
.
it
can
best
be
described
as
numerical
computing
environment
and
a
programming
language
.
since
we
will
be
using
matlab
extensively
in
this
course
,
and
in
the
programming
assignments
.
you
'll
have
access
to
a
license
of
matlab
for
the
duration
of
the
course
.
in
fact
,
this
license
wo
n't
expire
until
a
few
week
,
weeks
after
the
course
ends
,
which
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
complete
all
of
the
assignments
.
these
detailed
installation
instructions
can
be
found
in
the
aforementioned
programming
assignment
section
.
as
well
as
links
to
resources
for
learning
the
key
matlab
concepts
that
you
're
going
to
be
needing
,
that
you
're
going
to
need
to
complete
all
of
the
assignments
.
the
reason
that
we
're
using
matlab
in
the
programming
assignments
is
that
we
've
developed
a
simulator
for
mobile
.
robots
in
matlab
.
and
the
simulator
emulates
the
quickbot
and
this
robot
has
a
two
wheel
differential
drive
,
five
infrared
sensors
,
and
two
wheel
encoders
.
all
of
the
programming
assignments
are
based
on
the
simulator
and
they
will
require
you
to
,
for
,
example
,
write
a
go
to
go
controller
for
the
quickbot
that
drives
it
from
point
a
to
point
b.
and
to
help
you
in
this
endeavor
,
we
've
included
a
very
detailed
user
manual
.
that
will
help
you
both
implement
and
test
your
code
.
if
you
choose
to
receive
feedback
on
your
solutions
we
've
designed
a
user
interface
just
for
that
.
in
fact
over
here
is
a
screenshot
of
this
of
this
application
.
what
you
do
is
you
enter
your
submission
log
in
and
password
,
here
.
and
then
you
select
which
parts
of
the
assignment
you
would
like
to
have
graded
.
for
example
,
you
might
want
to
grade
this
part
,
but
not
this
part
.
so
you
just
check
the
first
one
.
once
you
're
ready
to
submit
,
you
hit
the
submit
to
coursera
for
grading
,
for
grading
button
right
here
.
what
will
happen
is
that
a
script
will
start
the
simulator
,
as
well
as
your
code
to
gather
output
and
compare
the
output
to
values
stored
on
the
coursera
servers
.
if
your
output
matches
with
,
with
what
is
on
the
coursera
server
,
you
will
get
a
check
mark
.
and
100
%
for
this
part
of
the
assignment
.
if
it
does
not
,
you
will
get
an
x.
and
that
means
you
've
gotten
0
%
credit
for
this
part
of
the
assignment
.
however
,
do
n't
worry
.
you
will
get
feedback
about
what
you
might
want
to
change
in
order
to
get
the
correct
solution
.
and
you
may
resubmit
as
many
times
as
you
want
until
you
get
a
hundred
percent
on
all
of
the
parts
.
just
remember
that
the
points
earned
in
this
assignment
will
not
count
towards
your
grade
,
but
this
is
really
a
great
opportunity
to
get
some
feedback
on
your
solutions
.
so
let
's
see
all
that
in
action
in
matlab
.
this
is
matlab
.
here
you
see
the
command
window
,
and
to
my
left
is
the
current
folder
.
what
i
've
done
is
i
've
downloaded
the
zip
with
the
simulator
for
this
week
.
and
i
've
unzipped
it
and
browsed
to
this
location
.
here
are
all
the
files
for
the
simulator
.
if
you
want
to
launch
the
simulator
you
simply
type
launch
into
the
command
window
and
hit
enter
.
this
brings
up
the
simulator
,
along
with
this
cute
swatch
screen
,
swatch
screen
right
here
.
along
with
a
few
instructions
on
how
to
use
the
simulator
.
when
you
hit
play
.
the
simulation
starts
.
you
can
see
the
quick
boat
in
the
center
,
and
i
can
zoom
in
and
zoom
out
using
these
buttons
.
as
you
can
see
the
quick
boat
has
two
wheels
,
and
five
infrared
sensors
.
these
infrared
sensors
in
blue
are
not
detecting
any
obstacles
,
but
the
ones
in
red
are
detecting
this
red
obstacle
right
here
.
we
can
also
pen
around
and
see
that
there
are
several
other
obstacles
.
for
example
,
these
walls
over
here
in
the
environment
.
any
time
you
click
on
the
robot
the
robot
will
be
centered
on
the
screen
for
you
.
you
can
also
pause
and
resume
the
simulation
at
any
time
.
or
restart
the
entire
,
entire
simulation
by
clicking
on
the
home
button
.
once
you
're
ready
to
submit
,
you
type
in
submit
.
this
will
bring
up
the
submission
window
.
again
,
here
are
,
is
the
login
and
password
for
,
for
the
submission
on
coursera
.
this
week
's
assignment
only
has
one
part
to
it
which
is
to
run
the
simulator
.
but
on
other
weeks
you
might
have
up
to
three
different
parts
to
complete
.
once
i
hit
submit
to
coursera
for
grading
,
the
simulator
should
pop
up
.
and
then
close
,
close
again
because
the
entire
assignment
was
just
to
run
the
simulator
once
.
and
as
you
can
see
,
i
've
done
that
,
so
i
've
gotten
a
check
mark
and
100
%
for
this
assignment
.
if
you
have
any
questions
,
issues
,
bugs
,
or
concerns
,
please
create
a
post
in
the
discussion
forums
under
the
programming
assignments
section
.
and
make
sure
to
include
enough
information
for
us
and
fellow
students
to
help
you
out
.
and
with
that
,
i
wish
you
good
luck
.
