welcome to course control mobile 
robots 
name is magnus egerstedt, im a 
professor 
georgia tech in school electrical 
computer engineering 
i delighted to able to to 
deliver this, this course to you 
focus course is, you 
make 
mobile robots move in effective safe 
predictable ways 
meaning that dont slam 
obstacles, move smoothly 
nicely without weird oscillations 
in motions 
trick to achieving this is 
something called control theory 
an this first module course is 
going to focus controls control 
theory, 
is, pieces that 
you need to able to actually control 
robots 
i dive in, though, i wanted to say 
a few words 
research hammer 
is control theory, so that, ive 
already said, deals 
you make things move behave 
well 
this could stock markets 
this could cruise controllers 
this could limiting spread 
epidemics, instance, using 
vaccination strategies 
so control theory doesnt really a 
tight, necessary coupling to robotics 
a general language describing 
things behave 
now, if thats hammer, nail is 
robotics 
im very, interested in 
you make robots elegant useful 
things 
and, in lab, we really three 
different types robotics 
one is swarm robotics 
so you get lots lots robots 
to exciting things together 
is something called behavior 
based control, behavior based robotics 
we will see quite a bit this in 
this course 
behavior is basically a controller thats 
in charge something, like, going 
towards 
a landmark, slamming 
obsticles, 
following cooridors, things like 
that 
question is you design 
behaviors you patch 
together 
third thing that im interested in is 
field robotics 
meaning you take robots put 
in 
unstructured, strange world outside 
lab, meaning, if you 
a robot driving forest, 
a sudden there 
corridors hallways doors 
life becomes much complicated 
so, we start, i wanted to show a 
little 
video that came lab a few years 
ago 
so, here, this is is an example swarm 
robotics 
we robots that asked to 
spell grits 
grits stands georgia robotics 
intelligence systems 
thats robotics lab that im 
directing 
and, robots to figure 
go in letter 
need to figure go 
there 
need to figure to go there without 
slamming 
so, whats going there is control 
design multiple levels abstraction 
one each, one is high level, 
you go 
you lower level deals 
with, okay, i know i want to 
i actually get there without 
driving 
robots, instance 
you see, robots, 
limited information, meaning 
dont really 
know every robot is, 
figure 
go in this 
formation 
this video i like multiple 
reasons 
one is, theres a lot control 
theory going underneath hood 
second is, you will able to 
this end this course 
so, lets talk a little 
course 
control theory will play a key role, 
meaning, you actually control 
systems 
this will done decoupled 
robotics 
then, going to couple in 
robotic applications 
looking robot models, 
robots 
hopping 
slithering 
rolling 
flying 
different type robots require 
different type controllers 
going to look in general 
mobility, 
meaning, you make robots move 
thats main question interested 
in, in this course 
well end applications 
so, you actually use robot 
for, robots 
we need kinds solutions that we 
will going in course 
i want to say though, that course 
is 
artificial intelligence, 
is high level planning, 
meaning robots actually 

going to dealing 
question of, theyve already figured 
doing, 

going to deal much 
perception, meaning we 
take computer motion, data actually 
turn something actable 
we actually design perception 
algorithms 
going to assume that someone else 
done this 
going to act perceptual 
data that we already 
a mechanical engineering 
course 
meaning, going to building 
robots 
dealing different kinds robotic 
designs 
however, there is a slight little caveat 
to that 
we will indeed looking 
hardware aspects robotics 
here is a video a course i taught 
campus georgia tech 
and, this is a robot 
thats running a lot things that 
learning in this course, meaning 
figuring 
to get to a landmark, in this case, a 
purple little tape mark floor 
to while avoiding 
obstacles 
so, to design different controllers 
different situations 
instance, left robot is 
so well 
right robot here is even worse 
slamming things 
point is that, end this 
course you will able to this 
hopefully better we seeing 
right 
now, robots 
place 
here seeing 
instantiations this 
see 
robot is oscillating a little bit 
much, is able 
to navigate the, cardboard box and, 
well, right robot is driving 
chairs 
robot seems to a little 
confused 
so, examples robotic 
controllers 
that arent perfectly tuned perfectly 
designed 
lets look a final race 
going to see outcome would 
if youd done control design 
properly 
see, theyre going straight 
theres little oscilation 
well, one robot is oscilating 
purple robot 
there seems to really well, going 
quite straight 
this, in mind, is a successful 
robotic control design 
so, is actually in course, 
is this structured 
well, going to lectures 
therere going to eight mini lectures 
week 
and, there going to seven weeks in 
total 
week will capped a quiz 
and, there will also glue lectures 
so, lectures that designed to glue 

i do, slides, to actual quizzes 
then, a bonus, there will 
additional material 
this is mandatory 
if you it, experience will 
doubt enjoyable 
first all, we a robotic simulator 
that we use in lab called simiam 
runs matlab this will part 
course, meaning you if you 
want to 
few words, matlab, is program 
environment we using 
this is one standards in 
engineering world 
now, you will able to get matlab 
free a student license this 
course 
so this will come extra cost to you 
then, well also map this onto a real 
hardware 
platform, where, if youre interested you 
build robot 
because, i truly believe that there 
nothing exciting 
theory right, seeing things 
move in real world 
so, if you follow along course, 
simulatin also build robot 
end, you will an awesome 
platform that actually run around in 
world 
without slamming things 
we this though, i want to make 
one minor maybe even major disclaimer 
to robotics right to control 
theory right 
there is way around fact that you 
need math 
so mathematics will play a key role 
this may a little uncomfortable to 

you first a 
reason 
i 
will try best to make sure that i 
explain 
actually going stuff 
that going 
things like linear algebra, matrices, 
eigen values will show 
differential equations will play a key 
role 
calculus, derivatives integrals will 
everywhere 
this is something you to 
in able, 
in a, in order to able to robotics 
right 
i hope you 
will following along this ride 
this seven week adventure 
a final note, actual course 
begins, let that 
this opportunity to introduce team 
behind course, graduate 
students in robotics control theory, 
here georgia tech, here 
is smriti chopra, smriti is going to 
running the, glue lectures 
so lectures that going to 
map general stuff 
that i in class onto particulars 
weekly quizzes 
and, 
smriti is also going to highly involved 
discussion forums 
here we jp de laqua 
jp is going to the, master 
ceremony comes to running the, 
robotic experiments that 
sprinkling in throughout 
course to highlight stress 
particular key points 
jp is also key force behind 
optional 
simulation part course, will 
running 
weekly programming assignments 
here lastly is roland oflaherty 
roland is hardware guy 
hes going to show us to build robots 
this will also an optional weekly 
feature we will building 
platforms that, 
end day, we implement 
run controllers code 
roland tells that hes actually 
going 
to produce a cooking show, instead 
baking bread, we will baking robots
