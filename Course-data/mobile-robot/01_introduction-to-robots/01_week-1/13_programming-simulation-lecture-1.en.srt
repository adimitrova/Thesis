1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello and welcome to the first Programming
and Simulation lecture.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,728
I am JP, I am very excited to introduce

3
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:10,800
the program, programming assignments in
this course to you.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,130
Since this course is about controlling

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,750
mobile robots, the progra, programming
assignments will

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,939
focus on applying what you learn on the
lectures to simulated mobile robots.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,950
Therefore we will be using math lab based
robot simulator called [UNKNOWN], and its

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,360
important for you to know that the weekly
assignments are entirely optional.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,730
Meaning that they do not factor into your
course grade however you

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,090
have the option to submit each one of the
assignments for feedback.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,950
Since these programming exercises are
completely optional, let me take a

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,410
moment to convince you why they are worth
your time and effort.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,060
First of all, they are a very unique

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,070
opportunity to apply what you learn in
this

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,550
course to a interesting problem.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,110
In this case, it's safely navigating a
mobile robot through

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,769
a cluttered environment which is a super
exciting problem to solve.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,530
Second of all, you will learn MATLAB,
which

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,700
is a very powerful tool for any engineer.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,630
And as a bonus, if you build draw in
QuickBot in this, that's built in this

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,190
course, then everything that you write in
the

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,810
programming assignments can be directly
tested on this robot.

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,230
Hopefully, that's enough to convince you
to start

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,260
with the programming assignments, so let's
get started with.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,740
Programming assignment number one and the
objective for this first assignment is

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,650
to get comfortable with MATLAB and to run
the simulator at least once.

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,410
We have included detailed instructions for
this assignment in a section called

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,610
programming assignments and you can find
this directly on our course page.

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,730
If your not already familiar with MATLAB.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,400
It can best be described as

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,110
numerical computing environment and a
programming language.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,830
Since we will be using MATLAB extensively

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,470
in this course, and in the programming
assignments.

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,938
You'll have access to a license of MATLAB
for the duration of the course.

35
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,480
In fact, this license won't expire until a
few week, weeks after the

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,340
course ends, which will be plenty of time
to complete all of the assignments.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,600
These detailed installation instructions
can be

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,820
found in the aforementioned programming
assignment section.

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,430
As well as links to resources for learning
the key MatLab concepts that you're

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,560
going to be needing, that you're going to
need to complete all of the assignments.

41
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,770
The reason that we're using MATLAB in the
programming

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,250
assignments is that we've developed a
simulator for mobile.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,450
Robots in MATLAB.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,590
And the simulator emulates the QuickBot
and

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,630
this robot has a two wheel differential

46
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,460
drive, five infrared sensors, and two
wheel encoders.

47
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,200
All of the programming assignments are
based on the

48
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,290
simulator and they will require you to,
for, example,

49
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,060
write a go to go controller for the
QuickBot

50
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,500
that drives it from point a to point b.

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,700
And to help you in this endeavor, we've
included a very detailed user manual.

52
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,980
That will help you both implement and test
your code.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,740
If you choose to receive feedback on your

54
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,030
solutions we've designed a user interface
just for that.

55
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:11,170
In fact over here is a screenshot of this
of this application.

56
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,870
What you do is you enter your submission
log in and password, here.

57
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,650
And then you select which parts of the
assignment you would like to have graded.

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,740
For example, you might want to grade this
part,

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,950
but not this part.
So you just check the first one.

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,317
Once you're ready to submit, you hit the
submit

61
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:35,230
to Coursera for grading, for grading
button right here.

62
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,370
What will happen is that a script will
start the simulator, as well as your

63
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,900
code to gather output and compare the

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,400
output to values stored on the Coursera
servers.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,440
If your output matches with, with what is
on

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,490
the Coursera server, you will get a check
mark.

67
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,804
And 100% for this

68
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:54,420
part of the assignment.
If it does not, you will get an x.

69
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,740
And that means you've gotten 0% credit for
this part of the assignment.

70
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,510
However, don't worry.

71
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,760
You will get feedback about what you might
want

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,300
to change in order to get the correct
solution.

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,540
And you may resubmit as many times as you
want

74
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,720
until you get a hundred percent on all of
the parts.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,210
Just remember that the points earned in
this assignment will not

76
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,220
count towards your grade, but this is
really a great opportunity

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,830
to get some feedback on your solutions.
So let's see all that in action in MATLAB.

78
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,460
This is MATLAB.

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,740
Here you see the command window, and to my
left is the current folder.

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,270
What I've done is I've downloaded the zip
with the simulator for this week.

81
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,760
And I've unzipped it and browsed to this
location.

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,070
Here are all the files for the simulator.

83
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,770
If you want to launch the simulator you

84
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,250
simply type launch into the command window
and

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,780
hit enter.

86
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,565
This brings up the simulator, along with

87
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:48,760
this cute swatch screen, swatch screen
right here.

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,410
Along with a few instructions on how to
use the simulator.

89
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,580
When you hit play.
The simulation starts.

90
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,590
You can see the quick boat in the center,
and

91
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,720
I can zoom in and zoom out using these
buttons.

92
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,420
As you can see the quick boat has two
wheels, and five infrared sensors.

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,510
These infrared sensors in blue are not
detecting any obstacles, but

94
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,200
the ones in red are detecting this red
obstacle right here.

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,940
We can also pen around and see that there
are several other obstacles.

96
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,680
For example, these walls over here in the
environment.

97
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,100
Any time you click on the robot the robot
will be centered on the screen for you.

98
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,725
You can also pause and resume the
simulation at any time.

99
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:40,490
Or restart the entire, entire simulation
by clicking on the home button.

100
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,380
Once you're ready to submit, you type in
submit.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,740
This will bring up the submission window.

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,610
Again, here are, is the login and password
for, for the submission on Coursera.

103
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,490
This week's assignment only has one part
to it which is to run the simulator.

104
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,770
But on other weeks you might have up to
three different parts to complete.

105
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,030
Once I hit submit to Coursera for grading,
the simulator should pop up.

106
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,000
And then close, close again because the

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,290
entire assignment was just to run the
simulator once.

108
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,300
And as you can see, I've done that, so

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,080
I've gotten a check mark and 100% for this
assignment.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,030
If you have any questions, issues, bugs,
or concerns, please create

111
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,510
a post in the discussion forums under the
programming assignments section.

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,550
And make sure to include enough
information for

113
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,030
us and fellow students to help you out.

114
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,400
And with that, I wish you good luck.
