in this lecture going to a little 
bit precise we mean 
we say control theory, ive 
throwing around this term controls quite a 
bit so far, even though weve seen 
one lecture i want to is 
make this a little bit precise so 
that we get a slightly better 
understanding ofwhat is that 
going to in class and, 
ultimately controls, deal 
dynamical systems abstractions 
that describe something that changes 
time this could a car thats moving 
this could price a particular 
stock ultimately, controls is dealing 
we best we 
influence this change system 
examples, going to see 
examples in class systems 
that one control, would robots, 
epidemics, you could come 
vaccination strategies, stock markets, 
thermostats keeping temperature 
pleasant indoors, electrical circuits, dc 
engines, power grids, autopilots a 
aircraft will show 
see easy to control 
actually hard to 
control also going to 
understand makes certain systems 
harder to control others i put 
robots in red though this 
end day is main focus 
course point view 
so lets start trying to build a 
control system in terms basic 
needed building blocks first 
thing you need is way describing 
system is or, 
importantly, is if i want to 
control a car, lets say i want to build a 
selfdriving car that drives home 
to office, well i need to know 
car is, central to this is 
notion a state state represents 
system is currently doing, 
state that in, going to use 
x to describe state system 
is this could position 
velocity a, a, robot, this could 
p ercentage people that 
infected a certain, epidemic, this 
could a number different things, 
ultimately state is key thing that 
describes system is to 
is actually is dynamics 
dynamics is description 
change state a function time 
now, this is good but, we want 
way influencing this so, going 
to a reference signal that is going 
to going to use a way 
telling system is that we want 
to so reference could set 
cruise controller to miles per 
hour, make a certain amount money 
stock market, make 
temperature in room degrees 
i know we that we want, 
lets say that we want a cruise 
controller to go miles per hour, 
thats going to work until we 
actually measure fast system is 
going so we also need an output so 
going to use r reference, y 
output out, outputs 
things that able to get 
system this is telling us system 
is so we cant always measure 
state y is output this picture is 
actually a blatant lie, if i tell 
stock market to go make a certain 
amount money theres way going 
to that if i you know yell 
car, going to go miles per 
hour so we need way mapping 
reference signals actual control 
signals, inputs so u is going to 
thing that takes reference 
produces a control signal that hits 
state system this is 
fine good this control design is 
particularly good control 
signal nothing to 
measurements so we need final 
building block is feedback this 
is a mapping outputs to inputs in 
sense that is 
taking y here oh, sorry 
taking y here, lets say y, 
taking refer ence here 
comes reference minus y, is 
going to error in terms 
system is performance this error is 
translating control signal 
thats hitting system so this 
feedback mapping is really key to 
kind controls in an effective 
way good 
so, that we know a little bit 
basic building blocks i want 
to talk examples so we try 
to understand building blocks 
actually represent so, state a 
robot is typically, if a mobile robot 
ground, position, maybe 
orientation robot, maybe 
velocity robot state is 
ultimately we need to describe 
if a manipulator robot, 
would angles, joint angles 
various, segments the, 
robot so that would state 
dynamic simply says robot is 
moving control signal, control 
input, would things like velocities 
torques accelerations ways 
moving robots around, 
measurements would things like, 
is robot is seeing in 
environment epidemics, like i said a 
state would maybe percentage 
population is infected thing we 
control, so input would 
vaccination strategies in this case, 
output is tricky hard to know 
percentage a population is 
infected instance with, an 
infection so, there, output would 
kind measurements hospitals 
many people show this 
particular disease stockmarket state 
could be, in fact one really knows 
state is this stock market is 
impart so hard to make money 
output would be, well, prices 
stock input is simply buy sell 
thermostats, temperature, outputs 
temperature, thing we control is 
turning things circuits 
typically state would currents 
voltages and, currents, inputs 
typically voltages that youre 
applying outputs measured 
currents voltages in circuits 
engines you apply, typically voltages 
comes a torque power grid, 
well state there somehow is power 
consumption across different modules 
things you control putting 
loads generators onto grid, maybe 
thing autopilots aircraft, 
states would positions 
velocities, things you control 
accelerations change the, control 
surfaces aircraft, 
measurements a whole bunch things, 
fast is going, is going, 
whats altitude whats wind 
resistance things like that so, 
we need to is come a rather 
general way describing 
systems, in a way that makes sense, that 
we use and, that importantly, 
use to control mobile robots
