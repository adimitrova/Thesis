00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,590
Hi, I'm Smriti Chopra.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:09,320
I am a graduate student at Dr. Egerstedt's
lab, and I will be your instructor for the

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,810
Glue Lectures, for the duration of this
course, which is Control of Mobile Robots.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,425
And just a quick idea: what are these Glue
Lectures?

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,525
Basically, they're going to kind of
connect, you know what you learn

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,470
with Dr. Egerstedt to the quizzes we are
going to give you.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,180
And give you helpful hints about the
quizzes.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,380
Clarify, repeat certain concepts.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,890
By that I really mean we, you know, work
out a few

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,190
examples, understand the math that goes
behind some of the lectures, etc.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,950
Just to help you guys move along the
course.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,900
And the format is going to be one Glue
Lecture every week.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,610
And the course is seven weeks, so seven
Glue Lectures.

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,070
And on a side note Amy LaViers is a former

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,640
grad student in our lab, and she was last
year's

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,630
instructor for the Glue Lectures.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,330
So we will be reusing some of her
lectures.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,860
And so in the coming weeks, you know she
and I are going to share.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,390
Between the two of us, we're going to
teach you guys, out of the seven lectures.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,920
But whatever questions, etc, you have, you
direct them to me, because well she's

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,780
not here, and I'll be answering those
questions for you on the forums, etc.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,410
And with that, let's get into the
lectures.

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,070
The first one is Dynamical Models.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,750
This week with Dr. Egerstedt, you guys
kind of, you

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,090
know, went through this introductory
notion of what a model is.

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,520
And he tells you that really, a model is
basically, you

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,420
know, something that describes how your
system changes or evolves with time.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,320
And your system could be a robot, for

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,240
example, and a model is just going to
describe,

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
let's say, how the positions change with
time,

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,670
or how the angle, angles change with time,
etc.

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,610
And the whole idea behind controls

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,730
is that we're going to kind of try and
influence this

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,530
change to make our system do something we
want to do.

35
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,060
And we're going to do this by injecting
controls.

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,080
But let's go really down to the basics.
What really is a model?

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,670
And before we do that, let's do a little
exercise in derivatives.

38
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,640
So here we have, let's say, position x,
with

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,310
the respect to time, is given by this
exponential function.

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,154
Now this is in its general form.

41
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm saying that let's say me, for example,
my position is x

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,026
of t, and I wake up at time t equal to 0.

43
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:18,166
I'm at position 10.

44
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,670
So and I'm saying that my position evolves
with time with

45
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,770
respect to this function here, and it's
given by this graph here.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,830
That's okay.

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,250
That's simple.

48
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,380
And now I can take the derivative of this
position with respect to time, right?

49
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,290
And I get what,

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,990
what is the velocity.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,180
And you'll see this is actually 2x of t,
really.

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,220
And then you can do this further on, and
you can take

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,930
more derivatives, and now we have the
acceleration, which is 4x of t.

54
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,130
One thing I want to point, point out
really quick here is

55
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,800
that x dot of t equal to 2x of t, for
example.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,440
Now what is this?

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
This is really nothing but a differential
equation.

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,415
Basically something that relates a
variable x to

59
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,450
its derivatives, second, third whatever.

60
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,180
So in this case, x dot equal to 2x of t is
a differential equation.

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,842
Something he mentioned in class, right?

62
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:09,441
Okay.

63
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,410
So this was just an exercise in
derivatives.

64
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,040
You guys should be able to take
exponentials and their derivatives, etc.

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,560
No problem.

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,758
We saw the graphs related to these, as
well.

67
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,540
But in action, what does it really mean?

68
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,380
So I'm telling you that my position with
respect to chi,

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,360
time changes like this: 10e to the power
2t.

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,380
What it really means is, let's say that's
me, or that's a pink ball, whatever.

71
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,420
And now I draw this line, which is the x
axis.

72
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,714
And I start at 10, which is where I wake
up, because you guys see, if we're here in

73
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,674
this equation, if you put x at time 0,
you'll

74
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:48,546
get 10, e to the power 0, which is 10.

75
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:50,646
So at time 0, when I wake

76
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,009
up, I'm at 10.
Right?

77
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,163
And now, the whole point is that let's say
at

78
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:59,260
time t equal to 0, like I said, we wake
up.

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,890
Now I say start, right?

80
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,308
And then I start moving.

81
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:08,531
And as my time increases, my position is
going

82
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,130
to keep changing with respect to this
function here.

83
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,340
And because it's exponential, let's say at
time point 1, I'm here.

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,690
And then I

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,070
jump really high at point 2, and then even
further.

86
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,170
because exponentially my position is
changing.

87
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,690
So, so from graphs, all of a sudden we see

88
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,790
how it maps onto, these equations map onto
actual motion.

89
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,850
That's all I wanted to really show in
this.

90
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,470
But now, instead, I tell you that, you
know what, I'm

91
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,937
not going to tell you how x changes with
respect to time.

92
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:40,762
I'm instead going to give you

93
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,412
this set of equations, which is a
differential equation,

94
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,299
and then an initial condition where I wake
up.

95
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:51,141
And now I want to find what my x of t is
going

96
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:56,284
to be, given this, which is x dot of t and
x of 0.

97
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,650
So in this case what do you do?

98
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,730
Well, what you do is, and this is what you
did

99
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,130
in your lectures as well, just to see how
you evolve

100
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,020
with res, with time, you discretize the
world.

101
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,973
And real quick, let's say this is your
time axis.

102
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,934
And I'm going to divide up this time axis
into, you

103
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:20,060
know, delta t chunks, where each chunk is
0.5 seconds, or whatever.

104
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,560
So it's very simple.

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,450
I just divide up the axis.

106
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,190
And now, I'm going to say that my t is
actually given by this k delta t.

107
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,280
This is how you discretize, right?

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,210
And k becomes a counter.
Why?

109
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,170
Because when k is equal to 0, my time is
0.

110
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,690
And when k is 1, it's 0.5.
When k is 2, I'm at one, etc.

111
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,832
So k becomes kind of like a counter,
right?

112
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:47,340
All right.
Now let's see how the ball is moving.

113
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,350
So we know that we discretized time.

114
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,370
What we want to see is now, as I move k
from 0, 1, 2, 3, how does my ball move?

115
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,785
And sort of extract x

116
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:59,087
of t from it.
Right?

117
00:05:59,087 --> 00:05:59,903
Okay.

118
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:05,760
So again, this is our equation in
continuous time.

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,300
So remember I told you I have given you
only two things.

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,070
These are the two things that I've given
you.

121
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,420
Okay, so I know this guy here, that at
time 0, I'm here.

122
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,710
And now I have the equation, the
differential equation.

123
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,400
Well, you can discretize this differential

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,290
equation through something called
Taylor's,

125
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,860
Taylor extension, which you guys did

126
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,640
with Dr. Egerstedt, which basically is
given by this equation here.

127
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,030
And a quick note.

128
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,100
What it really is doing is, it's kind of
saying, x k plus 1 is

129
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,300
nothing but x times k plus 1 times delta
t.

130
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,537
Right?
And xk is nothing but

131
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,326
x at time k delta t.

132
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,397
So it's, by incrementing k, what we are
doing is we are finding out at

133
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,985
the next time instant, discrete dimension
where should

134
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,870
I be, depending on my previous time
instant.

135
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,971
That's all this equation is really doing.

136
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:06,692
A good thing to note here, though, is that
we will be using just the first

137
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,949
two terms of the Taylor expansion, which
is

138
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,505
what you guys did in the lectures as well.

139
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,137
This expansion

140
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:17,553
is really an approximation, because you
see these dot

141
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:20,800
dot dot here it just goes on and on.

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,995
You keep taking derivatives, and you keep
going on, so obviously the more

143
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:31,050
terms you use, the better your
approximation of x of t will be.

144
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,890
But as of now, we're just going to use the
first two terms of the expansion.

145
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,670
So let's see.

146
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,002
Here we have x of t is 2x, delta t is 0.5,
we know this, t is k

147
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,890
delta t, and now let's put this entire
thing

148
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,480
into this equation of ours, the discrete
time equation.

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,800
And we get this guy here, x k plus 1 is
equal to 2xk.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
You guys should do this yourselves.
It's really simple.

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,000
But just, you know, plug in values.
You get this one equation.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,850
And this is now our discrete time update
equation.

153
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,400
And how do we use this?

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,538
Well, we are simply going to say okay, so
at k is equal to 0, x of 0 is 0, and now

155
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:18,680
xk plus 1, which is x1, will be 2 times x
of 0, which is actually 20, right?

156
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,280
So we saw that at k is equal to 1, which

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,000
is actually time point 0.5, I jumped from
here to here.

158
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,950
Okay?
And now I keep

159
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,401
incrementing k.

160
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:36,250
So now I take k is equal to 1, and I
calculate my x2, which is now 40.

161
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,040
And then I take k is equal to 2, and I
increment, and I get x3, which is 80.

162
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,230
For all you guys, you guys can kind

163
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,900
of see that this is really a linear
approximation.

164
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,040
It's not changing exponentially, and like
we thought it should,

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,380
because we know that it should change
exponentially, but it's not.

166
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,880
And this is because, like I said, the more
terms you

167
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,690
take in the Taylor series for

168
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,360
your approximation, the better the
approximation.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,630
So here, since we took just two terms,
it's a kind of linear approximation.

170
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,510
If I take more terms and added, you know,

171
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,700
acceleration, etc, then your approximation
would have been better.

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,410
And so, what we actually just found out,
was nothing more than

173
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,560
a dynamical model, and how you kind of
solve it to see how

174
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,770
your system is evolving.

175
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,560
So your differential equation and an
initial condition, or just a condition,

176
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,460
basically telling you this is where I am
at a certain time.

177
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,900
These two things are more than enough to
find out how your system

178
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,570
is evolving with respect to time, and what
is your x of t.

179
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,710
And in general, general form, this is, how
you say, is your dynamical model.

180
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,580
Basically, it's an equation

181
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,310
x star of t.

182
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,150
That is a function of its, you know, state
or time.

183
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,900
And later on, this is where you put in
your control

184
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,730
input, you as well, when you guys go later
into the course.

185
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,470
So you kind of, like I said, influencing
the change x

186
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,650
dot of t, to make x of t do whatever you
want.

187
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,400
Right now we're not dealing with control,
so it's

188
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,360
just simply x dot of t is given by
something.

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,670
And you have an equation here x t star is
x star,

190
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,570
which is basically saying that at some
time, I'm

191
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,870
going to tell you where you should be in
space.

192
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,430
And with just this information, you should
be able to evolve

193
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,480
x of t, and see how your state is changing
with time.

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,430
So that was pretty simple.

195
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,990
Punchline.

196
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,160
This is the following dynamical model,
which we've been solving all this while.

197
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,630
We know how x evolves.

198
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,736
But we know how x evolves numerically,
right?

199
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,790
We discretize the world.
And we

200
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:41,520
saw how x should evolve as we move the
counter from 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

201
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,560
But we didn't really get the equation out.

202
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,430
You know, the mathematical expression for
x of

203
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,850
t, which we know is the exponential 2t,
10.

204
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,050
We know that this was the actual solution,
but

205
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,690
we really didn't get this equation, pretty
equation out.

206
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,620
What we got was a

207
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,880
list of basically times, and where x
should land up, numerical solutions.

208
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,920
So if you had to, let's say, get the
equation out, what do you do?

209
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,345
Well, you integrate.

210
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:16,820
And again, like I said, we know already
the solutions.

211
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,910
That's our hint.
All we are given is this.

212
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,190
For all of those, this is not important
for the course, but

213
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,740
for all those people who want to see how
you integrate and get,

214
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,600
you know, x of t, we can go over it really
quick here.

215
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,520
It's really nothing but, of course, an
integration.

216
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,220
Let's say dx by dt is 2x.

217
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,310
You kind of separate the variables real
quick.

218
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,350
So you say over x is equal to 2dt.
Integrate both sides.

219
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,330
This is actually your logx is equal to two
t plus c, c is your constant.

220
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,155
And now this is an equation

221
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:55,020
you've got in which you're going to plug
in your initial condition.

222
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,860
So log10 is equal to c.

223
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,010
And from here you say, okay, so let me put
all this back into my main equation.

224
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,132
Logx becomes two t plus log10.
And now you kind of, you know, shift

225
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:15,880
terms here and there, and you get x is
equal to 10e to the power 2t, x of t.

226
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,205
So now you guys even saw that,

227
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,908
you know, if you don't want to do the
whole discretizing the

228
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:24,100
world and kind of simulating where you
should be, instead you can integrate.

229
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,880
And a word of caution here, that

230
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,640
you cannot always integrate and find the
solution.

231
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,770
Sometimes you have to rely on numerical
methods,

232
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,190
because analytical solutions may not even
exist, you know?

233
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,300
You may not get pretty equations for
dynamical models, etc.

234
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,670
But here, just to kind of show you that,
you know, you can do it.

235
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,560
Just integrate, and

236
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
you'll get the answer.

237
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,130
Again, it's not important for the course,
but woo, we got it.

238
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,320
But what is

239
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,170
important for the course is that even
though maybe, okay, we won't ask you

240
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,130
to integrate, what we'll do instead is
we'll say, okay, here is your model.

241
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,330
And I'm going to give you what I call a
candidate

242
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,450
solution, x of t should be 10e to the
power 2t.

243
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,400
And now what you need to do is figure out,

244
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,320
is this indeed a solution to the model or
not.

245
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,978
And for that, there are just two simple
steps that you do.

246
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:14,580
First is called the initial condition
check.

247
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,370
What does that mean?

248
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,750
It basically means that

249
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,790
I'm given this candidate solution, and
then

250
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,780
within the solution, I'm going to kind of
put

251
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,270
in my initial condition x of 0 and see if
I actually get 10 or not.

252
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:33,110
And here I do get 10, so it satisfies this
equation, my x of t.

253
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,070
And then the second check is the
differential equation check.

254
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,630
And what is that?

255
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,270
That is really nothing but okay, again I
have my candidate

256
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,320
solution, but I'm going to now take the
derivative of that candidate solution.

257
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,018
And 2e

258
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:46,994
to the power of 2t, which is really my

259
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,007
2 times x, and see if it satisfies this
equation.

260
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:51,960
And it does.

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,300
So this is another technique.

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,935
So in case, you know, given a model, you
don't want to

263
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,870
find out through integration or numerical
methods what your x of t should

264
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,480
be, but instead I'm telling you what it
should be, this is

265
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,520
how you check or confirm that it is indeed
a solution or not.

266
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,873
Okay.

267
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,473
So the take home message

268
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,990
of this entire lecture is really first,
dynamical models.

269
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,228
What are dynamical models?

270
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:17,530
I hope I've kind of given you guys an
idea, and

271
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,950
made you sort of comfortable with the idea
of, you know, models.

272
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,655
And for example, you have something like
this, right?

273
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,350
Okay, then how do we solve them?

274
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,940
We solve, one we can do by numerical
solving,

275
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,000
which is numerically discretize the world
and solve it.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,472
And then, another is analytically, through
integration, right?

277
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:42,630
And then the third thing, which is very
important, is that I give

278
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,040
you the model and then I say okay, this is
the candidate solution.

279
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,920
You check the solution through two checks,
the

280
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
first being initial condition, second
being differential equations.

281
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,760
And sort of try and verify that

282
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,160
this candidate solution is indeed
satisfying the model.

283
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
And this is a homework

284
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
assignment for you guys.

285
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,060
For this model, see if you can
numerically,

286
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,150
analytically, and this whole checking
thing, whether, you

287
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,990
know, you can kind of solve it and see if
you get this equation or not.

288
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,970
And before we wrap up this lecture,
there's just one

289
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,290
concept more, which is the equilibrium
point concept, which I want to introduce.

290
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:26,520
Which is really nothing but basically this
concept that if my state x wakes

291
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,110
up here at this point, or at this

292
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,030
position, or at this value, it stays
there.

293
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,370
As simple as that.

294
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,050
So it's really not anything more than
saying that

295
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,010
my x dot of t is going to be 0.

296
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,932
So to find an equilibrium point, you do
simply x dot

297
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,720
of t equal to 0, and find the value of x.

298
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,640
And like I said, now if, if I was to wake
up here, or if at, let's say, time

299
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,120
t is equal to 0 I or 3, or whenever I wake
up, I am at this equilibrium point.

300
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,820
Because my x dot of t is 0 and there's no
change, my change is basically 0.

301
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,050
I will stay there.
So it's really simple.

302
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,470
So in our case, in the dynamical

303
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,520
model case, x is equal to negative 1 by 3
is your equilibrium point.

304
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,770
So if you're asked, you know, find an
equilibrium point, simply

305
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,660
just put x dot equal to 0, or whatever
function you

306
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,725
have here equal to 0, and find the values
of your

307
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:24,390
state, x in this case, and that will be
your equilibrium point.

308
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,730
And also, with that check the forums.

309
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,920
Good luck with Quiz One.
And bye bye.
