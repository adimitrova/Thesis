so, last time we saw that pi 
regulator, slightly elaborate 
brother, pid regulator, enough to 
make cruise controller 
is, achieve stability, 
tracking parameter robustness today i 
want to talk a little bit pid 
control 
and, reason that is, this 
regulator is an important regulator 
controller thats there in 
virtually every industry you think of, 
there is a pid regulator going 
underneath hood in almost 
controllers and, there really three 
knobs you tweak here one is kp, 
is proportional gain others ki 
is integral gain kd 
is derivative gain i want 
to talk a little bit 
effects gains well first 
p we saw a contributor to 
stability in sense that, makes 
system, guaranteed helping 
to make system stable its, 
making responsive in sense 
that you respond if someone, if you 
click, press miles per hour 
cruise controller drives system 
towards that value im calling medium 
rate responsiveness 
super fast speed in fact, 
rate responsiveness is a function 
big kp is you saw, wasnt 
typically enough to achieve tracking 
i component is really good 
tracking in fact if system is 
stable an eye component is 
enough to assure tracking in almost 
cases also extremely effective 
rejecting disturbances so that integral 
part is a effective part to in 
controller much slower in 
sense that you to accumulate 
time errors to respond to 
an integral so it, re, responds 
slower there is a there is a 
little bit a warning i need to make 
there, making k i large you may 
well induce oscillation so this is not, oh 
im going to pick 
a million go home yo u to a 
little careful in you actually select, 
select gates d part, well, 
since responding to actual 
values, values change is in 
values, typically faster 
responsiveness, so something is to 
happen well, rate is changing so the, 
derivative part kicks in typically 
faster there is a little caveat to 
this thats derivative is 
sensitive to noise if you a 
signal thats noisy if you compute 
derivative that signal youre going 
to get rather aggressive derivatives that 
dont necessarily correspond to 
non noisy signal would so you to 
a little careful d part so 
making kd large is typically an 
invitation to disaster youre, 
youre reacting to, to noise so, 
last thing i want to point though is 
you put this together you get pid 
is already far used low 
level controller low level means whenever 
you a dc motor somewhere you want 
to make something somewhere there is 
a pid leak whenever you a chemical 
processing plant getting right 
concentrations in chemicals, 
somewhere there is a pid regulator 
almost everywhere there, in almost 
control applications, pid shows 
hood in form another but, i 
want to point out, that this is a 
onesizefits we cant guarantee 
stability a pid regulator sometimes 
enough in fact, we go to 
complicated robotic systems, pid 
regulator will typically enough 
so we need to a lot 
thinking modeling to, to use 
this point we actually dont really know 
to pick gains however, i want 
to point that this is a very, 
useful type controller since is 
a feedback lob depends upon 
error actually fights uncertainty model 
parameters in a remarkable way 
feedback this remarkable ability to 
overcome fact that we dont know 
gamma, we dont know c, we dont know m 
still, we seem to well we 
design controllers a wide range of, 
parameters so said that, 
lets hook to car in fact we 
a pid regulator velocity control 
urban challenge vehicle, sting 
called we this model that weve 
already seen, i pick completely 
random arbitrary numbers here 
parameters i even put r equals to , so 
going to go mile per hour lets 
say meter per second really doesnt 
matter arbitrary values so 
youll see whats going so, if we 
start friend p regulator so 
we kp here 
gains well, we dont actually 
make to we make 
this we already seen so p part 
enough to, to 
stable achieve tracking well, thats 
ok in i part cruisecontroller 
kp is , ki is we 
a nice so called step response 
means we responding, we 
waking we hitting 
a step, in this case step height 
if miles per hour so 
this thing makes way stays 
there perfect so this is actually a 
good successful design right here 
,if this is so good dont we make ki 
higher to make even better well if i 
to crank ki to then, a 
sudden, system starts oscillating so 
this is an example integral 
part may actually cause oscillations 
is, we least aware 
this fact a little careful we 
tweak parameters if we see 
oscillations that is a clear indication 
that integral part is typically a 
little bit large d 
part well, lets add d part in this 
case, actually doesnt matter much 
you see here is that i a small d 
part im a little bit paranoid 
comes to large kd terms a 
little bit noise sensitive 
youre seeing here is that youre 
getting a faster initial response 
introduction a d part, then, 
we actually get almost a slower response 
towards end so d part is there to 
drive well in beginning, 
so stand in this particular 
application, a d gain thats 
ser, even clear if that was, 
useful this is thinking 
that goes tweeking pid regulators 
so we going to next time, is 
going to go now, this rather 
abstract, integrals derivatives, to 
something that we actually implement 
going to see pid gains 
show we control a altitude 
a hovering quad regulator
