hi, im smriti chopra 
i a graduate student dr egerstedts 
lab, i will instructor 
glue lectures, duration this 
course, is control mobile robots 
a quick idea glue 
lectures 
basically, theyre going to kind 
connect, you know you learn 
dr egerstedt to quizzes we 
going to give you 
give you helpful hints 
quizzes 
clarify, repeat certain concepts 
that i really mean we, you know, work 
a few 
examples, understand math that goes 
behind lectures, etc 
to help you guys move along 
course 
format is going to one glue 
lecture every week 
course is seven weeks, so seven 
glue lectures 
a side note amy laviers is a former 
grad student in lab, last 
years 
instructor glue lectures 
so we will reusing 
lectures 
so in coming weeks, you know 
i going to share 
between two us, going to 
teach you guys, seven lectures 
whatever questions, etc, you have, you 
direct to me, well shes 
here, ill answering 
questions you forums, etc 
that, lets get 
lectures 
first one is dynamical models 
this week dr egerstedt, you guys 
kind of, you 
know, went this introductory 
notion a model is 
tells you that really, a model is 
basically, you 
know, something that describes 
system changes evolves time 
system could a robot, 
example, a model is going to 
describe, 
lets say, positions change 
time, 
angle, angles change time, 
etc 
whole idea behind controls 
is that going to kind try 
influence this 
change to make system something we 
want to 
going to this injecting 
controls 
lets go really to basics 
really is a model 
we that, lets a little 
exercise in derivatives 
so here we have, lets say, position x, 

respect to time, is given this 
exponential function 
this is in general form 
im saying that lets say me, example, 
position is x 
t, i wake time equal to 
im position 
so im saying that position evolves 
time 
respect to this function here, 
given this graph here 
thats okay 
thats simple 
i take derivative this 
position respect to time, right 
i get what, 
is velocity 
youll see this is actually x t, 
really 
you this on, 
you take 
derivatives, we 
acceleration, is x 
one thing i want to point, point 
really quick here is 
that x dot equal to x t, 
example 
is this 
this is really nothing a differential 
equation 
basically something that relates a 
variable x to 
derivatives, second, third whatever 
so in this case, x dot equal to x is 
a differential equation 
something mentioned in class, right 
okay 
so this an exercise in 
derivatives 
you guys able to take 
exponentials derivatives, etc 
problem 
we saw graphs related to these, 
well 
in action, really mean 
so im telling you that position 
respect to chi, 
time changes like this e to power 

really means is, lets say thats 
me, thats a pink ball, whatever 
i draw this line, is x 
axis 
i start , is i wake 
up, you guys see, if here in 
this equation, if you put x time , 
youll 
get , e to power , is 
so time , i wake 
up, im 
right 
now, whole point is that lets say 

time equal to , like i said, we wake 

i say start, right 
i start moving 
time increases, position is 
going 
to keep changing respect to this 
function here 
exponential, lets say 
time point , im here 
i 
jump really high point , even 

exponentially position is 
changing 
so, so graphs, a sudden we see 
maps onto, equations map onto 
actual motion 
thats i wanted to really show in 
this 
now, instead, i tell you that, you 
know what, im 
going to tell you x changes 
respect to time 
im instead going to give you 
this set equations, is a 
differential equation, 
an initial condition i wake 

i want to find x is 
going 
to be, given this, is x dot 
x 
so in this case you 
well, you is, this is you 

in lectures well, to see 
you evolve 
res, time, you discretize 
world 
real quick, lets say this is 
time axis 
im going to divide this time axis 
into, you 
know, delta chunks, chunk is 
seconds, whatever 
so simple 
i divide axis 
now, im going to say that is 
actually given this k delta 
this is you discretize, right 
k becomes a counter 

k is equal to , time is 
k is , 
k is , im one, etc 
so k becomes kind like a counter, 
right 
right 
lets see ball is moving 
so we know that we discretized time 
we want to see is now, i move k 
, , , , ball move 
sort extract x 

right 
okay 
so again, this is equation in 
continuous time 
so remember i told you i given you 
two things 
two things that ive given 
you 
okay, so i know this guy here, that 
time , im here 
i equation, 
differential equation 
well, you discretize this differential 
equation something called 
taylors, 
taylor extension, you guys 
dr egerstedt, basically is 
given this equation here 
a quick note 
really is is, kind 
saying, x k plus is 
nothing x times k plus times delta 

right 
xk is nothing 
x time k delta 
so its, incrementing k, we 
is we finding 
next time instant, discrete dimension 

i be, depending previous time 
instant 
thats this equation is really 
a good thing to note here, though, is that 
we will using first 
two terms taylor expansion, 
is 
you guys in lectures well 
this expansion 
is really an approximation, you 
see dot 
dot dot here goes 
you keep taking derivatives, you keep 
going on, so obviously 
terms you use, better 
approximation x will 
now, going to use 
first two terms expansion 
so lets see 
here we x is x, delta is , 
we know this, is k 
delta t, lets put this entire 
thing 
this equation ours, discrete 
time equation 
we get this guy here, x k plus is 
equal to xk 
you guys this 
really simple 
just, you know, plug in values 
you get this one equation 
this is discrete time update 
equation 
we use this 
well, we simply going to say okay, so 
k is equal to , x is , 
xk plus , is x, will times x 
, is actually , right 
so we saw that k is equal to , 
is actually time point , i jumped 
here to here 
okay 
i keep 
incrementing k 
so i take k is equal to , i 
calculate x, is 
i take k is equal to , i 
increment, i get x, is 
you guys, you guys kind 
see that this is really a linear 
approximation 
changing exponentially, like 
we thought should, 
we know that change 
exponentially, 
this is because, like i said, 
terms you 
take in taylor series 
approximation, better 
approximation 
so here, since we took two terms, 
a kind linear approximation 
if i take terms added, you know, 
acceleration, etc, approximation 
would better 
so, we actually found out, 
nothing 
a dynamical model, you kind 
solve to see 
system is evolving 
so differential equation an 
initial condition, a condition, 
basically telling you this is i 
a certain time 
two things enough to 
find system 
is evolving respect to time, 
is x 
in general, general form, this is, 
you say, is dynamical model 
basically, an equation 
x star 
that is a function its, you know, state 
time 
later on, this is you put in 
control 
input, you well, you guys go later 
course 
so you kind of, like i said, influencing 
change x 
dot t, to make x whatever you 
want 
right dealing control, 
so 
simply x dot is given 
something 
you an equation here x star is 
x star, 
is basically saying that 
time, im 
going to tell you you in 
space 
this information, you 
able to evolve 
x t, see state is changing 
time 
so that pretty simple 
punchline 
this is following dynamical model, 
weve solving this while 
we know x evolves 
we know x evolves numerically, 
right 
we discretize world 
we 
saw x evolve we move 
counter , , , , etc 
we didnt really get equation 
you know, mathematical expression 
x 
t, we know is exponential t, 
we know that this actual solution, 

we really didnt get this equation, pretty 
equation 
we got a 
list basically times, x 
land up, numerical solutions 
so if you to, lets say, get 
equation out, you 
well, you integrate 
again, like i said, we know already 
solutions 
thats hint 
we given is this 
those, this is important 
course, 
people want to see 
you integrate get, 
you know, x t, we go really 
quick here 
really nothing but, course, an 
integration 
lets say dx dt is x 
you kind separate variables real 
quick 
so you say x is equal to dt 
integrate sides 
this is actually logx is equal to two 
plus c, c is constant 
this is an equation 
youve got in youre going to plug 
in initial condition 
so log is equal to c 
here you say, okay, so let put 
this back main equation 
logx becomes two plus log 
you kind of, you know, shift 
terms here there, you get x is 
equal to e to power t, x 
so you guys even saw that, 
you know, if you dont want to 
whole discretizing 
world kind simulating you 
be, instead you integrate 
a word caution here, that 
you cannot always integrate find 
solution 
sometimes you to rely numerical 
methods, 
analytical solutions may even 
exist, you know 
you may get pretty equations 
dynamical models, etc 
here, to kind show you that, 
you know, you 
integrate, 
youll get answer 
again, important course, 
woo, we got 
is 
important course is that even 
though maybe, okay, we wont ask you 
to integrate, well instead is 
well say, okay, here is model 
im going to give you i call a 
candidate 
solution, x e to 
power 
you need to is figure out, 
is this indeed a solution to model 

that, there two simple 
steps that you 
first is called initial condition 
check 
that mean 
basically means that 
im given this candidate solution, 

within solution, im going to kind 
put 
in initial condition x see if 
i actually get 
here i get , so satisfies this 
equation, x 
second check is 
differential equation check 
is that 
that is really nothing okay, i 
candidate 
solution, im going to take 
derivative that candidate solution 
e 
to power t, is really 
times x, see if satisfies this 
equation 

so this is another technique 
so in case, you know, given a model, you 
dont want to 
find integration numerical 
methods x 
be, instead im telling you 
be, this is 
you check confirm that is indeed 
a solution 
okay 
so take home message 
this entire lecture is really first, 
dynamical models 
dynamical models 
i hope ive kind given you guys an 
idea, 
made you sort comfortable idea 
of, you know, models 
example, you something like 
this, right 
okay, we solve 
we solve, one we numerical 
solving, 
is numerically discretize world 
solve 
then, another is analytically, 
integration, right 
third thing, is 
important, is that i give 
you model i say okay, this is 
candidate solution 
you check solution two checks, 

first initial condition, second 
differential equations 
sort try verify that 
this candidate solution is indeed 
satisfying model 
this is a homework 
assignment you guys 
this model, see if you 
numerically, 
analytically, this whole checking 
thing, whether, you 
know, you kind solve see if 
you get this equation 
we wrap this lecture, 
theres one 
concept more, is equilibrium 
point concept, i want to introduce 
is really nothing basically this 
concept that if state x wakes 
here this point, this 
position, this value, stays 
there 
simple that 
so really anything 
saying that 
x dot is going to 
so to find an equilibrium point, you 
simply x dot 
equal to , find value x 
like i said, if, if i to wake 
here, if at, lets say, time 
is equal to i , whenever i wake 
up, i this equilibrium point 
x dot is theres 
change, change is basically 
i will stay there 
so really simple 
so in case, in dynamical 
model case, x is equal to negative 
is equilibrium point 
so if youre asked, you know, find an 
equilibrium point, simply 
put x dot equal to , whatever 
function you 
here equal to , find values 

state, x in this case, that will 
equilibrium point 
also, that check forums 
good luck quiz one 
bye bye
