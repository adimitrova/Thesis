1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,090
Welcome to the course Control of Mobile
Robots.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,080
My name is Magnus Egerstedt, and I'm a
professor at

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,590
Georgia Tech in the school of Electrical
and Computer Engineering.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,250
And I am delighted to be able to to
deliver this, this course to you.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,310
The focus of the course is, how do you
make

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,590
mobile robots move in effective and safe
and predictable ways?

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,250
Meaning that they don't slam into
obstacles, they move smoothly and

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,770
nicely without having weird oscillations
in their motions.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,100
And the trick to achieving this is
something called control theory.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,910
An this first module of the course is

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,890
going to focus on controls and control
theory, and

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,660
what it is, and what the pieces are that

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,570
you need to be able to actually control
robots.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,330
Before I dive in, though, I wanted to say
a few words about myself.

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,700
My research hammer

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,440
is control theory, so that, as I've
already said, deals

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,920
with how do you make things move or behave
well.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,210
This could be stock markets.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,660
This could be cruise controllers.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,550
This could be limiting the spread

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,750
of epidemics, for instance, using
vaccination strategies.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,910
So control theory doesn't really have a
tight, necessary coupling to robotics.

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,380
It's a general language for describing how
things behave.

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,970
Now, if that's my hammer, my nail is
robotics.

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,420
And I'm very, very interested in how do

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,760
you make robots do elegant and useful
things.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,430
And, in my lab, we do really three
different types of robotics.

28
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,990
One is swarm robotics.

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,540
So how do you get lots and lots of robots
to do exciting things together.

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,600
The other is something called behavior
based control, or behavior based robotics.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,360
And we will see quite a bit of this in
this course.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,210
Behavior is basically a controller that's

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,720
in charge of something, like, going
towards

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,560
a landmark, or not slamming into
obsticles,

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,970
or following cooridors, or things like
that.

36
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,070
And the question is: how do you design

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,730
these behaviors and how do you patch them
together.

38
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,110
The third thing that I'm interested in is
field robotics.

39
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,640
Meaning how do you take robots and put
them out in

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,400
the unstructured, strange world outside of
the lab, meaning, if you

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,120
have a robot driving through the forest,
all of a sudden there

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,040
are no corridors or hallways or doors and
life becomes much more complicated.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,980
So, before we start, I wanted to show a
little

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,930
video that came out of my lab a few years
ago.

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,490
So, here, this is is an example of swarm
robotics.

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,740
We have 15 robots that have been asked to
spell grits.

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,670
And grits stands for Georgia Robotics and
Intelligence Systems.

48
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,550
That's the robotics lab that I'm
directing.

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,660
And, these robots have to figure out where
they should go in the letter.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,860
They need to figure out how they should go
there and they

51
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,660
need to figure out how to go there without
slamming into each other.

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,210
So, what's going on there is control
design at multiple levels of abstraction.

53
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,880
One each, one is the high level, where
should you go?

54
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,630
Then you have the lower level which deals
with, okay, I know where I want to be.

55
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,140
How do I actually get there without
driving

56
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,390
into other robots, for instance.

57
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,200
And as you can see, these robots,

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
with very limited information, meaning
they don't really

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,320
know where every other robot is, they
figure

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,300
out where they should go in this
formation.

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,040
And this video I like for multiple
reasons.

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
One is, because there's a lot of control
theory going on underneath the hood.

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,910
And the second is, you will be able to do
this at the end of this course.

64
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,250
So, let's talk a little about

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,750
the course.

66
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,870
Control theory will play a key role,

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,820
meaning, how do you actually control
systems?

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,060
And this will be done decoupled from
robotics.

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,180
But then, we're going to couple in the
robotic applications by

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,490
looking at robot models, because not all
robots are the same.

71
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,290
Some are hopping.

72
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,720
Some are slithering.
Some are rolling.

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
Some are flying.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,640
And different type of robots require
different type of controllers.

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,730
We're going to look in general at
mobility,

76
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,860
meaning, how do you make the robots move?

77
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,170
That's the main question we're interested
in, in this course.

78
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,020
And then we'll end with applications.

79
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,700
So, what can you actually use these robot
for, robots for and where do

80
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,460
we need the kinds of solutions that we
will be going through in the course.

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,530
I do want to say though, that the course
is

82
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,760
not about artificial intelligence, which
is the high level planning,

83
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,920
meaning what should the robots actually be
doing.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,810
We're going to be dealing with the
question of, when they've already figured

85
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,810
out what they should be doing, how should
they be doing it.

86
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,600
We're not going to deal much with
perception, meaning how do we

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,470
take computer motion, data and actually
turn it into something actable?

88
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,240
Or how do we actually design perception
algorithms?

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,480
We're going to assume that someone else
has done this.

90
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,920
And we're going to act on the perceptual
data that we already have.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,040
And it's not a mechanical engineering
course.

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,870
Meaning, we're not going to be building
robots

93
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,610
or dealing with different kinds of robotic
designs.

94
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,600
However, there is a slight little caveat
to that.

95
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,190
Because we will indeed be looking at some
hardware aspects of robotics.

96
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,990
Here is a video from a course I taught on
campus at Georgia Tech.

97
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,390
And, this is a robot

98
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,130
that's running a lot of the things that

99
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,360
we're learning in this course, meaning
it's figuring out

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,320
how to get to a landmark, in this case, a
purple little tape mark on the floor.

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
But it has to do it while avoiding
obstacles.

102
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,500
So, it has to design different controllers
for different situations.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,520
For instance, the left robot is not doing
so well.

104
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,310
The right robot here is doing even worse.

105
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,360
It's slamming into things.

106
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,440
But the point is that, at the end of this
course you will be able to do this.

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,030
Hopefully better than what we are seeing
right

108
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,320
now, because the robots are all over the
place.

109
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,340
Here we're seeing some other
instantiations of this.

110
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,840
See

111
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,800
how the robot is oscillating a little bit
too much, but it is able

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,380
to navigate the, the cardboard box and,

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,330
well, the right robot is driving into
chairs.

114
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,270
The other robot seems to be a little
confused.

115
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,780
So, these are examples of robotic
controllers

116
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,360
that aren't perfectly tuned and perfectly
designed.

117
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,510
Let's look at a final race.

118
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,100
We're going to see what the outcome would

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,570
be if you'd done the control design
properly.

120
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,720
See, they're going straight.
There's very little oscilation.

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, one robot is oscilating but the
purple robot

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,630
there seems to be doing really well, going
quite straight.

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,578
And this, in my mind, is a successful
robotic control design.

124
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:37,560
So, what is actually in the course, or how
is this structured.

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,475
Well, we're going to have lectures.

126
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:42,930
There're going to be eight mini lectures
each week.

127
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,000
And, there are going to be seven weeks in
total.

128
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Each week will be capped by a quiz.

129
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,770
And, there will also be glue lectures.

130
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,350
So, lectures that are designed to glue
what

131
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,290
I do, my slides, to the actual quizzes.

132
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,780
And then, as a bonus, there will be
additional material.

133
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,260
This is not mandatory.

134
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,570
But if you do it, your experience will no
doubt be more enjoyable.

135
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,110
First of all, we have a robotic simulator

136
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,770
that we use in the lab called Sim.I.am.

137
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,310
It runs on MATLAB and this will be part of

138
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,256
the course, meaning you can do it if you
want to.

139
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:21,570
Few words, MATLAB, is the program
environment we are using

140
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,370
because this is one of the standards in
the engineering world.

141
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,520
Now, you will be able to get MATLAB

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
for free as a student license through this
course.

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,660
So this will come at no extra cost to you.

144
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,900
But then, we'll also map this onto a real
hardware

145
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,080
platform, where, if you're interested you
build your own robot.

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,260
Because, I truly believe that there' s
nothing more exciting than doing

147
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,560
the theory right, and then seeing things
move in the real world.

148
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,740
So, if you follow along the course, do the
simulatin and also build the robot.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,630
At the end, you will have an awesome

150
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,780
platform that can actually run around in
the world

151
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,270
without slamming into things.

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,570
Before we do this though, I want to make
one minor or maybe even major disclaimer.

153
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,350
To do robotics right and to do control
theory right

154
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,720
there is no way around the fact that you
need math.

155
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,610
So mathematics will play a key role.

156
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,610
And this may be a little uncomfortable to
some of

157
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,390
you at first but we're doing it for a
reason.

158
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,810
And I

159
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,840
will try my best to make sure that I
explain why

160
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,410
we're actually going through all the stuff
that we're going through.

161
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,530
But things like linear algebra, matrices,
and eigen values will show up.

162
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,700
Differential equations will play a key
role.

163
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,890
Calculus, derivatives and integrals will
be everywhere.

164
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,090
And this is just something you have to do
in able,

165
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,720
in a, in order to be able to do robotics
right.

166
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,866
And I hope you

167
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:53,640
will be following me along this ride for
this seven week adventure.

168
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,890
As a final note, before the actual course
begins, let me that

169
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,030
this opportunity to introduce the team
behind the course, they are all graduate

170
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,646
students in robotics and control theory,
here at Georgia Tech, and here

171
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:15,210
is Smriti Chopra, Smriti is going to be
running the, the glue lectures.

172
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,490
So these are lectures that are going to
map the general stuff

173
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,920
that I do in class onto the particulars of
the weekly quizzes.

174
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,125
And,

175
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:26,000
Smriti is also going to be highly involved
on the discussion forums.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,575
And here we have J.P. de LaQua.

177
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,570
J.P. is going to be the, the master of
ceremony when it comes to running the,

178
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,220
the robotic experiments that we're
sprinkling in throughout

179
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,870
the course to highlight and stress
particular key points.

180
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,190
And JP is also the key force behind the
optional

181
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,360
simulation part of the course, and he will
be running

182
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,720
the weekly programming assignments.
And here lastly is Roland O'Flaherty

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,808
and Roland is the hardware guy.
He's going to show us how to build robots.

184
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,040
And this will also be an optional weekly

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,770
feature where we will be building
platforms that,

186
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,230
at the end of the day, we can implement
and run our controllers and code on.

187
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,440
And Roland tells me that he's actually
going

188
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,570
to produce a cooking show, but instead of
baking bread, we will be baking robots.
