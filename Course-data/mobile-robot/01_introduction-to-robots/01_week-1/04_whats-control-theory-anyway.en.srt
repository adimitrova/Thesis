1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,305
In this lecture we're going to be a little
bit more precise about what we mean when

2
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:10,234
we say control theory, and I've been
throwing around this term controls quite a

3
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:15,175
bit so far, even though we've only seen
one lecture. and what I want to do now is

4
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:19,320
make this a little bit more precise so
that we get a slightly better

5
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:24,120
understanding ofwhat it is that we're
going to be doing in the class. And,

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:29,675
ultimately controls, it deal with
dynamical systems. These are abstractions

7
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:35,082
that describe something that changes over
time. This could be a car that's moving.

8
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:41,015
This could be the price of a particular
stock. But ultimately, controls is dealing

9
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:46,840
with how can we best or how can we
influence this change of the system. And

10
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:54,025
some examples, and we're going to see all
of these examples in the class of systems

11
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:59,700
that one can control, would be robots,
epidemics, you could come up with

12
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:06,167
vaccination strategies, stock markets,
thermostat's for keeping the temperature

13
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:12,030
pleasant indoors, electrical circuits, dc
engines, power grids, or autopilots on a

14
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:17,240
aircraft and all of these will show up and
see which of these are easy to control and

15
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:21,815
which of these are actually very hard to
control. And we're also going to

16
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:26,810
understand what makes certain systems
harder to control than others. I put

17
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:31,670
robots in red though because this at the
end of the day is the main focus of the

18
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:37,140
course from the point of view.
So let's start with trying to build up a

19
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:42,140
control system in terms of the basic
needed building blocks. And the first

20
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:47,040
thing you need is some way of describing
what the system is doing or, more

21
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:52,365
importantly, where it is. If I want to
control a car, let's say I want to build a

22
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:57,690
self-driving car that drives from my home
to my office, well I need to know where

23
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:02,676
the car is, and central to this is the
notion of a state. The state represents

24
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:07,853
what the system is currently doing, what
state that it's in, and we're going to use

25
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:12,944
x to describe what the state of the system
is. This could be the position or the

26
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:17,860
velocity of a, of a, robot, this could be
the p ercentage of people that are

27
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:23,165
infected by a certain, epidemic, this
could be a number of different things, but

28
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:28,328
ultimately the state is the key thing that
describes what the system is up to. And

29
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,723
what it is actually doing is the dynamics.
And the dynamics is the description of the

30
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:38,959
change of the state as a function of time.
Now, this is all good. But, we want some

31
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:44,141
way of influencing this. So, we're going
to have a reference signal that is going

32
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:48,570
to. We're going to use it as a way of
telling the system what it is that we want

33
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:53,025
it to do. So the reference could be set
the cruise controller to 60 miles per

34
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:57,375
hour, or make me a certain amount of money
on the stock market, or make the

35
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:02,345
temperature in the room 70 degrees. What
do I know? now we can do that all we want,

36
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:07,460
but let's say that we want a cruise
controller to go at 60 miles per hour,

37
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,865
that's not going to work until we can
actually measure how fast the system is

38
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:16,460
going. So we also need an output. So we're
going to use r for the reference, y for

39
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:21,225
the output. And out-, the outputs are the
things that we're able to get out of the

40
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:26,624
system. This is telling us what the system
is doing. So we can't always measure the

41
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:32,131
state y is the output. Now this picture is
actually a blatant lie, because if I tell

42
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:37,440
the stock market to go make me a certain
amount of money there's no way it's going

43
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:42,814
to do that. If I just you know yell 65 at
my car, it's not going to go 65 miles per

44
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:47,184
hour so we need some way of mapping
reference signals into actual control

45
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:52,370
signals, the inputs. So u is going to be
the thing that takes the reference and

46
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:57,756
produces a control signal that then hits
the state of the system. Now this is all

47
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:02,851
fine and good but this control design is
not particularly good because the control

48
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:07,289
signal has nothing to do with the
measurements. So we need the final

49
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,824
building block which is the feedback. This
is a mapping from outputs to inputs in the

50
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,084
sense that what we're doing is we're
taking Y here. Oh, sorry.

51
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:22,220
We're taking y here, let's say y, and then
we're taking the refer ence and out here

52
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:27,080
comes the reference minus y, which is
going to be the error in terms of how the

53
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:32,025
system is performance. And this error is
translating into some control signal

54
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:37,173
that's then hitting the system. So this
feedback mapping is really the key to

55
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:40,826
doing any kind of controls in an effective
way. Good.

56
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:46,308
So, now that we know a little bit about
what are the basic building blocks. I want

57
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,775
to talk about examples just so we can try
to understand what these building blocks

58
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:57,090
actually represent. So, the state of a
robot is typically, if it's a mobile robot

59
00:04:57,102 --> 00:05:01,475
on the ground, it's the position, maybe
the orientation of the robot, maybe the

60
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:05,630
velocity of the robot. The state is
ultimately what we need to describe what

61
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:10,100
it's doing. If it's a manipulator robot,
it would be the angles, the joint angles

62
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:15,095
of the various, segments of the, of the
robot. so that would be the state. The

63
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:19,785
dynamic simply says how the robot is
moving. The control signal, or the control

64
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:24,580
input, would be things like velocities or
torques or accelerations. Some ways of

65
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:29,025
moving the robots around, and the
measurements would be things like, where

66
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,621
is the robot? What is it seeing in the
environment? The epidemics, like I said a

67
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,949
state would be maybe what percentage of
the population is infected? The thing we

68
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:42,125
can control, so the input would be
vaccination strategies. In this case, the

69
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,716
output is tricky. It;s very hard to know
what percentage of a population is

70
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:51,976
infected for instance with, with an
infection? So, there, the output would be

71
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:56,542
some kind of measurements at hospitals of
how many people show up with this

72
00:05:56,554 --> 00:06:01,749
particular disease. stockmarket state
could be, in fact no one really knows what

73
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:06,537
the state is of this stock market which is
why impart so hard to make money. the

74
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:11,236
output would be, well, the prices of the
stock and the input is simply buy or sell.

75
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:15,593
Thermostats, temperature, outputs
temperature, the thing we control is

76
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:20,039
turning things on and off. Circuits
typically the state would be currents

77
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:27,288
voltages and, and currents, and the inputs
are typically voltages that you're

78
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,096
applying and the outputs are measured
currents of voltages in the circuits.

79
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:37,755
Engines you can apply, typically voltages
and out comes a torque. the power grid,

80
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:42,840
well the state there somehow is power
consumption across the different modules.

81
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:48,000
The things you can control are putting
loads and generators onto the grid, maybe

82
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:53,162
same thing with autopilots on aircraft,
the states would be positions and

83
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:58,745
velocities, the things you can control are
accelerations or change the, the control

84
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:03,497
surfaces of the aircraft, and the
measurements are a whole bunch of things,

85
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:08,851
how fast is it going, where is it going,
what's the altitude? What's the wind

86
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:14,574
resistance and things like that. So, what
we need to do is come up with a rather

87
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:20,329
general way of describing all of these
systems, in a way that makes sense, that

88
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:25,813
we can use. And, that more importantly,
can use to control mobile robots.
