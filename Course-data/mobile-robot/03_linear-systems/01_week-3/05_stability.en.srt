1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,242
So in the previous lecture, we did a lot
of technical push ups to end up with end

2
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:13,006
up with a description of what the solution
to a general LTI system is. the reason for

3
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:18,323
that is, is that I really, really enjoy
rule, even though I do. but that it will

4
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,810
actually help us to characterize what
these systems are doing. And today, I want

5
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,003
to talk about stability, because as you
probably recall when we did a control

6
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:31,379
design, first order of business is to
design controllers so that systems don't

7
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:35,834
blow up. If they blow up, there's nothing
we can do about it. The quad rotors just

8
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:40,112
fall out of the air. The robots drive off
to infinity. The cars smash into things.

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:44,456
We don't want them to blow up, because the
deciding objectives are almost always

10
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:48,510
layered in this sense. First order of
business is stability. Then we want to

11
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:52,688
track whatever reference character or
reference point we have. We also want it

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,897
to be robust to parameter uncertainties,
and possibly noise. And then we can wrap

13
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:02,291
other objectives around it, like when you
want to move as fast, quickly as you can,

14
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,282
or use as little energy when you're
moving, or things like this. But,

15
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:10,984
regardless of which, stability is always
the first order of business. So let's

16
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:16,236
start with scalar systems, no inputs. So
only the A matrix now, in this case x dot

17
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:21,175
is little ax, which means that it's
scalar. Well then the solution x of t is e

18
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:26,261
to the a, we said t minus t naught x of t
naught. Here I simply picked t naught to

19
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:32,412
be equal to 0. So this is the solution.
Okay, lets plot what this solution looks

20
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:38,963
like. If a is positive, then x of t it
starts nicely and then pabaah. Its, its

21
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:45,841
blowing up as far as I can tell. So if a
is positive this system blows up. Well, if

22
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:52,199
a is negative, then e to the at, this is a
decaying exponential. So we get x to just

23
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:59,311
go, , nice down to zero. What happens if a
is zero in between these 2? Well, then you

24
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:04,248
have e to the zero t, which is 1. So then,
x of t is simply equal to x naught. x

25
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:08,747
never changes.
So here, it didn't blow up, but it didn't

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,006
actually go down to zero. And in fact,
what we have its, its really a sitution

27
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:19,989
where three possible things can happen you
blow up, you go down to zero, or you stay

28
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:25,436
put. So let's talk about these three
cases. The first case is what is called

29
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:31,350
asymptotic, stability. So the system is
asymptotically stable if x goes to zero

30
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:36,813
For all initial conditions, so this fancy
upside down a, is known as the universal

31
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:41,761
quantifier. All we need to know is that
when we see and upside down a the way we

32
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:46,634
pronounce it is for all x nought. So
asymptotic stability means that we go to

33
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:51,867
zero and almost always what we want to
design our system so that x actually goes

34
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,365
to 0 no matter where we start, that's
asymptotically stability and as you

35
00:02:56,377 --> 00:03:01,246
recall, in the scalar case, a strictly
negative corresponds to asymptotically

36
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:05,991
stability. And then we have unstability,
instability where the system being

37
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:10,947
unstable. What that means is there exists
an initial condition, so the flipped e,

38
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:16,110
and to speak for the existential
quantifier, which we read it as exists. So

39
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:21,235
it's unstable if there exists so many
extra conditions from which the system

40
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:26,185
actually blows up. In the scaler case, we
had A positive corresponding to

41
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:31,960
instability. and then we have something we
call critical stability, which is somehow

42
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:37,212
in between. The system doesn't blow up.
But it doesn't go to zero either, and in

43
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:42,227
fact, for the scalar system, this
corresponded, corresponded to the, a equal

44
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,459
to zero case. So if you summarize that, if
you have a scalar system then a positive

45
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:52,637
means the system is unstable. A negative
means that the system is asymptotically

46
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:57,560
stable, which is code for saying that the
state goes to zero. And a zero means

47
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:02,115
critically stable. Okay.
Let use this way of thinking now on the

48
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:07,665
matrix case. X. is ax, capital A. So this
is now, x is a vector, a is a matrix. What

49
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:12,715
do we do there? Well, we can't just say.
Oh, a is positive, or a is negative.

50
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:18,190
Because a is a matrix. It's not positive
or negative. But what we can do is we can

51
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,802
go for the next best thing, which is the
eigenva lues.

52
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:27,003
And, in fact, almost always, the intuition
you get from a scalar system translates

53
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:31,825
into the behavior of the eigenvalues of
these matrices. And for those of you who

54
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:36,798
don't know what eigenvalues are, these are
the special things that are associated

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,619
with matrices. So, if I have a matrix A; N
by N, and I multiply it by a vector an N

56
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:47,209
by 1 vector, if I can write it as the same
vector times a scalar, then what this

57
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,989
means is that the way that A acts on this
vector is basically scaling it. And the

58
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:58,737
scaling factor is given by lambda. If I
can, if I can find lambda of v to satisfy

59
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:04,575
this, then what I have is a lambda that is
called an eigenvalue. And it's actually

60
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:09,377
not a real number. It's typically a
complex number. So it's a, a slightly more

61
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,290
general object than just a real number,
but that's an eigenvalue. And v is known

62
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:19,350
as an eigenvector. And eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are really these fundamental

63
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:24,603
objects in, in when you're dealing with
matrices and when you want to understand

64
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:29,280
how they behave. And, whenever you think
scalar first, you can almost always

65
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:34,417
translate it into what do the eigenvalues,
eigenvalues do for your systems. And, the

66
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:39,013
eigenvalues actually would tell you how
the matrix a acts in the directions of eh

67
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:43,760
eigenvectors. So, you can almost think of
them as scalar systems in the directions

68
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:48,381
of the different eigenvectors. And, you
know, sometimes you may want to compute

69
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:52,097
eigenvalues. I don't.
So, if you use MATLAB. You would just

70
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:56,705
write, eig(A), and out pops the
eigenvalues. whatever software you, your

71
00:05:56,717 --> 00:06:01,222
comfortable with, you want to use C, or
Python, or whatever, there is almost

72
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:05,714
always a library that allows you to
compute eigenvalues. And, the command is

73
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:10,090
typically something like eig(A).
So, this would give you what eigenvalues

74
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:15,424
are, given a particular matrix. Okay.
Let's see what this actually means. Let's

75
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:20,623
take a simple example here. Here's my a
system. 1, 0, o minus 1. if you take eig a

76
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:26,407
of this. you get 1 eigenvalue being 1. And
the other eigenvalue being negative 1. And

77
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:30,540
the correspo nding eigenvectors are 1, 0,
and 0, 1. Okay.

78
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:37,010
What does this mean? It actually means the
following. So let's say that this is x1,

79
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:42,215
and this is x2. Okay.
V2 was 0, 1. So this was this direction.

80
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:48,525
So here is what, v2 is. This is the
direction in which v2 is pointing. Well,

81
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:54,356
the eigenvalue there is negative 1, which
means that, if you recall the scalar

82
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:58,670
system, when a was negative, we had
stability. So if I start here, my

83
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:03,586
trajectory is going to pull me down to
zero. Nice and stable, and in fact, if I

84
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,749
start here, it's going to pull me up to
zero, nice and stable. Right.

85
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:12,903
So, if I'm starting. on the x2 axis, my
system is well behaved. If I start on the

86
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:17,650
x1 axis, I have lambda 1 being positive,
which corresponds to little a being

87
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:22,535
positive in the scalar case, which means
that the system actually blows up. So,

88
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:27,404
here, the system goes off to infinity.
And, in fact, if I start here, my x2

89
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:33,308
component is going to shrink but my x1
component is going to go off to infinity.

90
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:39,975
So what I have is this is what the system
actually looks like. So the eigen vectors

91
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:45,768
in this case will tell me what happens
along different dimensions of, of the

92
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,856
system. So after all of this, if I have x
dot as big AX, and I can find a solution,

93
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:57,920
then the system is asymptotically stable,
if and only if, for the scalar case, we

94
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:03,579
had that little a had to be negative. What
we need in the matrix case is that the

95
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:08,733
real part, remember that Lambda are
complex, the real part of Lambda is

96
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:14,727
strictly negative for all eigenvalues to
a. For all, this is what asymptotic

97
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:20,285
stability means for linear systems.
Unstable means that there is one or more,

98
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:26,313
but one single bad eigenvalue spoils the
whole bunch. So a single eigenvalue that

99
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:33,181
has positive real part. This is an, a
sufficient condition for instability. And

100
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:40,933
we have critical stability only if so this
is a, a necessary condition that says the

101
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:47,607
real part has to be less than or equal to
0 for all igon values. But where we are

102
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:53,467
going to be spending our time is Typically
up here in the asymptotically stabl e

103
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,389
domain, because what we want to do, is we
want to design our system or our

104
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:04,008
controllers in such a way that the closed
loop system is asymptotically stable. So

105
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,029
we're going to somehow make the eigen
values have negative real part That's

106
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:13,939
going to be one of the design objectives
that we're interested in. And I want to

107
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:18,680
point out something about critical
stability that if one eigenvalue is 0 and

108
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:23,496
the rest of the eigenvalues have negative
real part, or if you have two purely

109
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:28,661
imaginary eigenvalues So they have no real
part, and the rest have negative real

110
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:33,964
part, then you have critical stability.
and we will actually see that a little bit

111
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:38,816
later on, but the thing that I really want
to take, you to take with you based on

112
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,872
this slide, is, you look at the a matrix,
you compute the eigenvalues. If the real

113
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:49,417
part of the eigenvalues are all negative
You're free and clear, the system is

114
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:54,725
asymptotically stable. If one or more
eigenvalues have positive real part, you

115
00:09:54,737 --> 00:10:00,134
toast, your system blows up. That is bad.
So, let's end with a tale of two pendula.

116
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:06,184
Here is the normal pendula, well if you
compute the of this, you get this matrix.

117
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:11,740
And the eigenvalues are j and negative j.
Well, I don't know if you remember, but on

118
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:16,785
the previous slide, there was a bullet
that said if you have 2 purely imaginary

119
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:22,180
eigenvalues, which we have here. We have 2
purely imaginary eigenvalues and then no

120
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:26,820
more, then we have critical stability.
What this actually means is that, this

121
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:31,410
pendulum, clearly, there is no friction or
grav-, or damping here. It's just going to

122
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:36,170
oscillate forever. It's not going to blow
up. And it's, , excuse me. And it's not

123
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:40,470
going to go down to zero. It's just going
to keep oscillating forever and ever. It's

124
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:44,821
critically stable system.
Now, let's look at the inverted pendulum

125
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:49,723
where I'm moving the base, but in that
case, a is 0110. We already know, this

126
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:54,813
things is going to fall over. Right? So,
if you compute the Eigen values you get

127
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:58,813
one Eigen value to be equal to negative 1
and 1 to be positive 1, which means that,

128
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:03,012
we have one Rothton eigenvalue. This
eigenvalue that's going to spoil the

129
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:07,764
system. So this in an unstable system. So
now that we understand that eigenvalues

130
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:12,925
really matter, and they really influence
the behavior of the system, let's see, ,

131
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:17,190
excuse me, how we can use this to our
advantage when we do control design.
