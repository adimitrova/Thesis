00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,636
>> Hello and welcome to our third Glue
lecture.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:07,541
To sort of round out the third week of the
course, today's Glue lecture is titled

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:12,091
Systems, and I'm going to talk kind of how
we think about systems in this course.

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,428
And this will be helpful for quiz 3, we'll
do 2 examples that are similar to

5
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:20,141
questions on the quiz.
So the goal of this lecture is to think

6
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:25,062
about how inputs and outputs can define a
system, and that's really How we are going

7
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:29,715
to think of systems in this course.
And then, I hope to kind of get you used

8
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:34,785
to this matrix representsation, this
states based form of systems by doing an

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:39,016
example of putting a second order system
into states based form.

10
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:43,808
And to do a linearization of a non-linear
second order system as well.

11
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:48,473
So first, let's just think for a few
minutes about what a system is.

12
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:53,825
So, you know, in general, we might think
of a satellite being a system, as a fancy

13
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:59,216
technological device that, that does
something that we design it to do.

14
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:04,804
We might think of it as something that has
this kind of confusing block diagram.

15
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:08,427
Description.
We might think of it as something in our

16
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:13,509
car, right or a, or a interface which was,
a technological interface that we, we

17
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,382
interact with..
Of course there's also the solar system,

18
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:21,441
that is somehow a system of planets that's
working together.

19
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:26,685
That we think of, or systems of the body,
different organs that work together to

20
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:30,658
perform basic functions.
So the point of this slide is just the

21
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:35,533
idea that the word system a lot and we
might all have different ideas about what

22
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:40,158
a system is and, you know, this course is
really kind of all about systems.

23
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:45,042
And so I kind of want to clarify what
we'll mean, and, when we think about them,

24
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:49,778
and the idea, really is that, in this
course, we want to understand how inputs

25
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:53,646
really relates to outputs.
And so any of these systems, we can be

26
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:58,686
considering different inputs, different
parts of the system that we can control or

27
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:03,582
actuate on and different outputs of the
system, different things that we might be

28
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,690
measuring for different goals.
So you know, on, you know, a satellite,

29
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,878
you might be controlling orientation.
And so you might think of different inputs

30
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,532
and outputs there, or you might be
controlling altitude, and so now you have

31
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:19,643
different actuators, different goals for
the altitude than the orientation.

32
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:23,593
So we could think of those really in this
course, as, as distinct systems that have

33
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:28,850
different control objectives.
And so the picture that we're thinking

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:36,082
about is really this idea that we have
some input here that we're mapping to an

35
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:40,166
output defined by these A, B and C
matrices.

36
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:45,527
And so getting into the first example,
we're going to talk about how to move a

37
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:51,052
dynamical equation that describes some
system into this form that looks like

38
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,852
this.
And at first that can be a little bit

39
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:58,955
tricky and so I want to go over it and of
course remembering that both of these

40
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:03,619
equations, have some initial condition.
F of 0 equals f not.

41
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:08,429
X of 0 equals x not.
Keeping that in mind, we're just going to

42
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:14,189
think right now about how to go between
something that looks like this to

43
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:19,175
something that looks like this.
And, really that's just a matter of

44
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:24,565
picking our state variables, de, deciding
what our state is, and then to/g choosing

45
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:29,095
these inputs and outputs.
So which of these variables is what we're

46
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:32,864
controlling and which of these is what
we're measuring.

47
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:38,405
And then we're going to write this second
order differential equation as a pair of

48
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:44,063
first order ones, so that our second order
system is now represented In terms of two

49
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:49,484
first order equations.
And then, put these in terms of our x, our

50
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:54,193
u, and our y, right?
So first, for this example, we'll select

51
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:59,463
our state to be f and f dot That's a
pretty common choice for, for a state at

52
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:04,988
not necessarily the only choice, but
you'll see that it's convenient because

53
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:09,091
when we think of x dot, x dot is going to
look like this right?

54
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:12,737
Oops, f double dot.
And now we ha, we, we need to be able to

55
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:18,188
know something about f double dot right to
for this choice of state, and so of course

56
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:22,993
we do, and so that's why you'll see that
Often as the choice of the state.

57
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:28,045
And now we pick our input to be this
function p here, so this is somehow,

58
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:33,787
someway that we're influencing what f,
the, the various derivatives of f are

59
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:39,442
doing, and now we'll chose our output to
be f, but again this could be chosen as f

60
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:45,461
dot, this could be chosen as both f and f
dot, And that will determine the form of

61
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:50,130
these a, b, and C matrices.
So those choices are important and usually

62
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,481
they are described in the problem setup.
So now that we have chosen our state, our

63
00:04:55,481 --> 00:05:00,601
input and our output we need to write this
equation in terms of two first order

64
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,302
equations.
So we can think of f-dot and f-double-dot.

65
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:10,606
Well now we're going to write them in
terms of our state variables x 1 x 2 in

66
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:14,908
our input and our output.
So, here we have f dot.

67
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:20,304
Well that was x2, right?
So we can directly relate f dot in terms

68
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:26,587
of x2 and now, x2 of course is related to
x1 through this, through this time

69
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:30,556
derivative.
And then for F double dot, well F double

70
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,839
dot is x two dot, and this equation that
we were given here.

71
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,565
So where I'm dividing by everything by m,
and now I'm writing remember X two is F

72
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:45,517
dot, so I filled that in here, and here
I'm filling in that X one is f.

73
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:50,595
And here I'm filling in that u is p.
So just rewriting this to this.

74
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:55,972
And so now if we come back, this is
exactly what I had on the last slide.

75
00:05:55,972 --> 00:06:01,498
X dot in terms of the other state
variables as we renamed them in the first

76
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:04,994
step.
And so now it's just a matter of getting

77
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:08,410
it to look something like a x plus b u,
right?

78
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:15,111
So I need to pull out, we need to, what I
would like to do is write an empty matrix,

79
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:19,033
and I know that I want that to be times x,
right?

80
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:25,593
So, I write x here, so that's the ax term.
And, now it's time some other matrix, this

81
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,947
one's going to be tall and skinny, times
u.

82
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:34,033
Okay, so here, I just need to kind of
rearrange these terms.

83
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:40,261
And here we'll have, so what, remember
that this is x 1 dot, and x 2 dot, that

84
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:44,402
we're trying to equal.
So what does x 1 dot equal?

85
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:50,936
Well, it equals x 2, so we just need no x
1 contribution, and 1 x 2 contribution,

86
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:55,318
and then no u.
>> So, now this first line, because, is

87
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:59,947
correct, right?
This x1 gets multiplied by the first entry

88
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:03,518
of the matrix, x2 gets multiplied by the
second.

89
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:07,205
They get added together, so this all adds
up to x2.

90
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:10,892
Now, for x2 dot, well that equals this
whole term.

91
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:14,394
So now we have a contribution from x1, x2
and u.

92
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:23,044
And that contribution for x one is beta
over, and from x two is alpha over m.

93
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:31,996
And now from u, we need to multiply u by
c, to get this o, over m, to get this term

94
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:36,565
tied up.
So That ends up looking like this, right?

95
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:40,779
Where this is our a matrix, and this is
our b matrix.

96
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:46,549
And we can do the same thing for y.
Y equals c x, and since y was f, and f is

97
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:52,609
x one, you get just a one in the, in the
entry of the matrix that x one will be

98
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:55,981
multiplied by.
So this is how you work.

99
00:07:55,982 --> 00:08:02,568
Something that looks like this and to stay
space form, So now we have that our system

100
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:08,772
where we picked our state, our input, our
output its represented by these three

101
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:13,644
matrices A, B and C.
So to pick up to get into example two.

102
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:18,806
This is going to be an example of
linearizing a non-linear system.

103
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:23,183
So this is a system where we have this z
squared term.

104
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:28,489
Sorry let me fix my marker here.
So now we have this z squared term, which

105
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:34,165
means we can't do what I just did where I
Wrote this empty a matrix and pulled out x

106
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:39,423
and just filled in the indices right.
We have this z squared term which means

107
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,100
it's not going to fit into that abc form.
And so what we do is we linearize it

108
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,580
around some operating point, and here that
point is going to be 0, 0.

109
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,484
And so first what we need to do, of
course, is just write this guy, the second

110
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:57,318
order.
Differential equation in terms of these 2

111
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:02,313
first order equations.
So just I'm writing this kind so that you

112
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:08,730
remember that x1 dot because of this twice
that we;re given in the problem that x and

113
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,440
z and z dot and our input u is tau.
That this is how, that d dot and d double

114
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,899
dot relate to x1 dot and x2 dot.
And so now we have that x1 dot is x2, x2

115
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,767
dot is this whole thing because that's
what d double dot is.

116
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:28,757
Again writing it in terms of our state
variables.

117
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:37,074
But now, again we have this x1 squared, so
we can't just write this in abc form.

118
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:44,175
So the way we do it in this case is to
just compute this A matrix, this

119
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:49,594
linearization.
So here we have f1, f and f2 which are

120
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:57,259
going to be, here's our f1, here's our f2.
And so we just have to compute these

121
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,652
derivatives in terms of our stay
variables.

122
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:09,254
So this first, let's I'll write it out.
For A, we have the derivative of this guy

123
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:12,005
with respect to x1.
That's 0.

124
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:16,589
Now the derivative x2 with respect to x2.
That's 1.

125
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,434
Now we look at f2 to compute the second
row.

126
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:25,432
Derivative of x2 with respect to x1 is
2lx1, this term.

127
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:31,218
Both of these other two terms go to zero,
and now f2 in terms of x2 is just gamma,

128
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:36,825
right, because here's the x2 term.
And so now this is our a matrix evaluated

129
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:41,872
at our operating point, right?
So this term is going to go away, and this

130
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:47,057
whole thing is going to equal zero, zero
0,1,0 gamma, for this choice of this

131
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:51,052
operating point.
So we're linearizing around that, around

132
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:54,183
that point.
In the case of the pendulum, when it's

133
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,715
hanging down.
Right?

134
00:10:55,715 --> 00:11:00,243
That we're just going to be able to
control it around that hanging down

135
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,751
position.
So, in nicer text, this is what we have.

136
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:08,839
And we do the same, a very similar process
for the B matrix, where Now the b matrix

137
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,465
has a different size, right?
But we have the derivative f one in terms

138
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,193
of u, and the derivative f two in terms of
u.

139
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:21,201
So that's these two equations again.
And we get this, that this is zero c, and

140
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:26,325
evaluated at any operating point this is
actually going to be the same thing

141
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:31,209
because it's not And a function of any of
our state variables anymore.

142
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:37,210
So now, the linearization of this system
is given by these 2 matrices.

143
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,776
And our output is going to be a similar
process, that I think Dr.

144
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:51,192
Iverson went over in lecture, as well.
So with that, good luck on quiz 3, and I

145
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:55,026
hope you're enjoying the course.
