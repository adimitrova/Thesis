hello welcome to third glue 
lecture 
to sort round third week 
course, todays glue lecture is titled 
systems, im going to talk kind 
we think systems in this course 
this will helpful quiz , well 
examples that similar to 
questions quiz 
so goal this lecture is to think 
inputs outputs define a 
system, thats really we going 
to think systems in this course 
then, i hope to kind get you used 
to this matrix representsation, this 
states based form systems an 
example putting a second order system 
states based form 
to a linearization a nonlinear 
second order system well 
so first, lets think a few 
minutes a system is 
so, you know, in general, we might think 
a satellite a system, a fancy 
technological device that, that 
something that we design to 
we might think something that 
this kind confusing block diagram 
description 
we might think something in 
car, right a, a interface was, 
a technological interface that we, we 
interact 
course theres also solar system, 
that is somehow a system planets thats 
working together 
that we think of, systems body, 
different organs that work together to 
perform basic functions 
so point this slide is 
idea that word system a lot we 
might different ideas 
a system is and, you know, this course is 
really kind systems 
so i kind want to clarify 
well mean, and, we think them, 
idea, really is that, in this 
course, we want to understand inputs 
really relates to outputs 
so systems, we 
considering different inputs, different 
parts system that we control 
actuate different outputs 
system, different things that we might 
measuring different goals 
so you know, on, you know, a satellite, 
you might controlling orientation 
so you might think different inputs 
outputs there, you might 
controlling altitude, so you 
different actuators, different goals 
altitude orientation 
so we could think really in this 
course, as, distinct systems that 
different control objectives 
so picture that thinking 
is really this idea that we 
input here that mapping to an 
output defined a, b c 
matrices 
so getting first example, 
going to talk to move a 
dynamical equation that describes 
system this form that looks like 
this 
first that a little bit 
tricky so i want to go 
course remembering that 
equations, initial condition 
f equals f 
x equals x 
keeping that in mind, going to 
think right to go between 
something that looks like this to 
something that looks like this 
and, really thats a matter 
picking state variables, de, deciding 
state is, tog choosing 
inputs outputs 
so variables is 
controlling is 
measuring 
going to write this second 
order differential equation a pair 
first order ones, so that second order 
system is represented in terms two 
first order equations 
then, put in terms x, 
u, y, right 
so first, this example, well select 
state to f f dot thats a 
pretty common choice for, a state 
necessarily choice, 
youll see that convenient 
we think x dot, x dot is going to 
look like this right 
oops, f double dot 
we ha, we, we need to able to 
know something f double dot right to 
this choice state, so course 
we do, so thats youll see that 
often choice state 
we pick input to this 
function p here, so this is somehow, 
someway that influencing f, 
the, various derivatives f 
doing, well chose output to 
f, this could chosen f 
dot, this could chosen f f 
dot, that will determine form 
a, b, c matrices 
so choices important usually 
described in problem setup 
so that we chosen state, 
input output we need to write this 
equation in terms two first order 
equations 
so we think fdot fdoubledot 
well going to write in 
terms state variables x x in 
input output 
so, here we f dot 
well that x, right 
so we directly relate f dot in terms 
x now, x course is related to 
x this, this time 
derivative 
f double dot, well f double 
dot is x two dot, this equation that 
we given here 
so im dividing everything m, 
im writing remember x two is f 
dot, so i filled that in here, here 
im filling in that x one is f 
here im filling in that u is p 
so rewriting this to this 
so if we come back, this is 
exactly i last slide 
x dot in terms state 
variables we renamed in first 
step 
so a matter getting 
to look something like a x plus b u, 
right 
so i need to pull out, we need to, i 
would like to is write an empty matrix, 
i know that i want that to times x, 
right 
so, i write x here, so thats ax term 
and, time matrix, this 
ones going to tall skinny, times 
u 
okay, so here, i need to kind 
rearrange terms 
here well have, so what, remember 
that this is x dot, x dot, that 
trying to equal 
so x dot equal 
well, equals x , so we need x 
contribution, x contribution, 
u 
so, this first line, because, is 
correct, right 
this x gets multiplied first entry 
matrix, x gets multiplied 
second 
get added together, so this adds 
to x 
now, x dot, well that equals this 
whole term 
so we a contribution x, x 
u 
that contribution x one is beta 
over, x two is alpha m 
u, we need to multiply u 
c, to get this o, m, to get this term 
tied 
so that ends looking like this, right 
this is a matrix, this is 
b matrix 
we thing y 
y equals c x, since y f, f is 
x one, you get a one in the, in 
entry matrix that x one will 
multiplied 
so this is you work 
something that looks like this to stay 
space form, so we that system 
we picked state, input, 
output represented three 
matrices a, b c 
so to pick to get example two 
this is going to an example 
linearizing a nonlinear system 
so this is a system we this z 
squared term 
sorry let fix marker here 
so we this z squared term, 
means we cant i i 
wrote this empty a matrix pulled x 
filled in indices right 
we this z squared term means 
going to fit that abc form 
so we is we linearize 
around operating point, here that 
point is going to , 
so first we need to do, 
course, is write this guy, second 
order 
differential equation in terms 
first order equations 
so im writing this kind so that you 
remember that x dot this twice 
that given in problem that x 
z z dot input u is tau 
that this is how, that d dot d double 
dot relate to x dot x dot 
so we that x dot is x, x 
dot is this whole thing thats 
d double dot is 
writing in terms state 
variables 
now, we this x squared, so 
we cant write this in abc form 
so way we in this case is to 
compute this a matrix, this 
linearization 
so here we f, f f 
going to be, heres f, heres f 
so we to compute 
derivatives in terms stay 
variables 
so this first, lets ill write 
a, we derivative this guy 
respect to x 
thats 
derivative x respect to x 
thats 
we look f to compute second 
row 
derivative x respect to x is 
lx, this term 
two terms go to zero, 
f in terms x is gamma, 
right, heres x term 
so this is a matrix evaluated 
operating point, right 
so this term is going to go away, this 
whole thing is going to equal zero, zero 
,, gamma, this choice this 
operating point 
so linearizing around that, around 
that point 
in case pendulum, 
hanging 
right 
that going to able to 
control around that hanging 
position 
so, in nicer text, this is we 
we same, a similar process 
b matrix, b matrix 
a different size, right 
we derivative f one in terms 
u, derivative f two in terms 
u 
so thats two equations 
we get this, that this is zero c, 
evaluated operating point this is 
actually going to thing 
a function 
state variables anymore 
so now, linearization this system 
is given matrices 
output is going to a similar 
process, that i think dr 
iverson went in lecture, well 
so that, good luck quiz , i 
hope youre enjoying course
