so we seen lti systems come 
weve seen non linear models that 
turn well behaved pretty lti 
systems weve seen non linear models 
that dont necessarily produce useful lti 
models a lot systems produce 
useful lti models really 
systematic way designing 
controllers extremely useful 
so even though there arent that many 
bananas in universe a lot things 
act like bananas so going to 
is, going to start 
understanding systems behave so 
im going to in this lecture is, 
im actually going to find solutions 
to systems we 
solutions we start talking 
behave going to start 
simply ignoring input ignoring 
output so going to start 
saying that, lets say that i x dot 
is ax time not, this is time 
we wake up, we start somewhere so 
this is the, physical part 
system thing that we bought 
actuators thing that we 
bought sensors x dot is ax 
lets see happens in that case 
system behave drift if you 
will, youre messing so 
we need to solve x dot is ax lets start 
a scalar version this, x is 
a number, right so scalar 
version im going to write this x dot 
little ax so this is a scalar version 
i start somewhere 
well, you may know this, if you 
take in see differential equations, 
solution to this differential equation is 
actually given x is e to a, 
minus times, times x so here, 
professor shows says, ohhh, this is 
solution to this differential 
equation you clearly critical 
thinking people dont accept 
anything professor says, so you 
want to is make sure that this is 
indeed correct so you ensure that 
someone feeds you, say heres a 
solution to differential equation, 
you make sure that this is correct 
we know well, first thing you to 
is make sure that initial 
conditions right meaning that, 
solution here actually respects this 
initial condition so im going to 
do, is, im simply going to plug in 
here, see i get well, if i 
that, i get x is e to a 
minus times x well, this 
thing is zero, right so i get e to 
power zero x e to power zero 
is always equal to one so, 
exponential evaluated zero is one so x 
is equal x means that 
initial condition is correct so 
done this now, clearly, we need to 
deal this, right we need to make 
sure that dynamics is indeed correct 
so im going to take time 
derivative proposed solution so im 
going to take d, dt this thing, see 
i get well, time derivative 
an exponential we is we pull 
coefficient there so going to 
pull a, write an extra a there, 
thats we this is 
exponentials so wonderful so time 
derivative x respect to is a 
times we here well that this 
thing, this thing here thats x right so 
prime derivative x, proposed x 
is equal to a times x well thats 
we started right so we know is 
that dynamics is correct well 
if initial conditions right 
dynamics is right we know thanks to 
existence uniqueness solutions 
to differential equations that this is, 
indeed, right solution here is 
kicker higher order systems so 
now, x is in rn we get solution 
we x is e to minus x 
here well, we this, x dot is 
thing thing i 
different i wrote capital a instead 
lowercase a thing to keep in mind 
here is that this is whats called a 
matrix exponential, instead a sc alar 
exponential, looks kind of, a 
little scary scared 
matrix exponentials in fact, we do, 
is we look definition an 
exponential an exponential, e to 
a scalars, well simple, simply 
this sum this is definition what, 
exponential is well, here is 
multiplications, we write 
multiplications matrices well so, 
definition a matrix exponential is 
this sum now, turns that 
actually that important to us to 
able to compute matrix exponentials 
much however, we need to know 
come come this sum 
reason this is useful, 
actually allows us to compute 
derivative a matrix exponential so 
lets take derivative, time 
derivative this whole sum, right so 
this is sum here well first term 
that im going to is im giong to, 
going to pull k equal to zero term 
here so i get a to power zero 
times to power zero divided zero 
factorial is one so this whole 
thing is actually equal to one 
im going to take time derivative 
one well time derivative one is a 
big fat zero so im going to pull 
first term im going to take 
derivative, remaining terms 
respect to so i get here is i get 
an extra k well, i rewrite 
things, i pull a write 
everything in terms k minus instead 
k here im summing one to 
infinity so if i shift k to see 
infinity i get back this thing so 
this means is that time derivative 
e to is simply big a times e to 
so matrix exponential behaves 
like scalar exponential thats i 
wanted to show this slide is that, 
even though this looks a little awkward, 
we sums matrix powers, 
means is that we take derivative 
matrix exponentials trust that 
behave like in scalar case in 
fact, e to a, minus is a 
fundamental object in linear systems 
theory that has, given 
name known state 
transition matrix sometimes, im 
actually going to write big pi 
we remember, 
probably i will remind you it, is that 
this is simply this matrix exponential 
thats means, will show 
quite a bit okay 
x dot is ax that means, in fact, that x 
is e to big a, minus x 
naught in general i write 
this form this state transition 
matrix we know is a fancier 
name this matrix exponential 
turns that doesnt matter if 
naught not, whatever time 
tao, well we multiply x 
that time tao times state transition 
matrix so this is simply code x 
is e to a minus tau, x time tau 
so point is that we know 
solution to, to this equation actually is 
way you would show that this is 
solution is you would use 
following two properties i encourage 
you to go home this first is 
thing we established is 
that time derivative pi is a tines 
oi is that, pi tt is 
identity well, pi tt i plug in a 
here instead a so, i get e 
to power zero, in scalier case 
thats one, in matrix case thats 
identity matrix so, thats 
difference you go matrix fine, so 
we actually a control system so, 
we x dot is ax plus bu, 
happens well again, professor goes 
well, heres claim, this is i 
claim that solution is this looks 
like a mouthful doesnt doesnt 
look pleasant stuff, in fact 
this is thing we we b 
matrix all, we 
thing, thing here thats if you want to 
picky this is whats called a convolution, 
but, we dont to calling 
convolution w e need to know is that, 
you know this is we claim 
solution is we actually verify 
that this is correct well, we exactly 
we we to check 
initial conditions dynamics so 
lets plug in see if we get right 
thing we get pi instead here, 
im going to write then, 
instead here here im going to 
write okay 
lets see this is well, pi tt is 
equal to identity matrix, matter 
is, right so this is identity 
now, heres an integral between 
so this is clearly zero 
im taking integral this 
individual points 
so this interval is zero so i 
is i that x is equal to 
be, x so going 
to declare success initial 
condition now, we need to deal 
dynamics thats harder first all, 
we use fact that if i take 
derivative this, i get an a so 
first component is big deal 
we this awkward object here we 
to take derivative an integral, 
respect to t, shows 
here here this, a 
trivial thing in fact, you need to 
do, is you need to use something known 
rule 
that tells us that if i a general 
function here tau i take 
derivative this thing respect to 
well, first this contribution here 
translates plugging in, instead 
tau i plugging in i 
getting rid integral thats 
first piecethe piece is i pooled d 
dt inside interval i to take 
reverse this thing respect to 
so this is technically we to 
to compute this so lets that 
well, f t, well, lets pull it, pull 
this thing, evaluate tau is 
equal to o clock i get phi t, 
times bu which, in fact, is simply u 
b, u t, right this thing is 
density matrix then, i get time 
derivative this thing or, in 
words, derivative this respect 
to well, i know that thats an a that i 
to pull in beginning so 
this is a little bit a mouthful, i 
realize, to that so, take a deep breath, 
redo this computation, so that 
you believe happens 
youve done this, is, you 
actually pull a, find that 
time derivative proposed x is, big 
a, times this whole thing, plus b times u 
now, this whole thing is equal to 
thing here so instead writing 
this rather awkwards big expression, im 
going to write, x sub here in 
words, d, xdt is ax plus bu which, 
is we started so we 
declare success also dynamics so 
to summarize, pushups, 
i realize that todays lecture a 
little bit a a little thorny in 
terms integrals 
derivatives in fact, much thornier 
anything weve ever seen 
reason i needed to i 
think you guys need to world champions 
applying rule 
i want to able to say 
following that if i x dot is ax plus 
bu y is cx 
i write y c times x 
we computed solution so we 
actually know that output is given 
this thing in yellow here you know 
lets add another sweetheart to 
this so push ups ended 
us able to write explicitly 
solution is now, going 
to able to particularly interested 
in actually computing this we 
need to know to move forward so 
end this application rule, we 
ended an expression 
output state if you want to get rid 
c matrices this general lti 
system fi here, thing to remember 
is that phi known state transition 
matrix simply given this matrix 
exponential going to in 
next lecture is see h ow this 
actually translate us able to 
say things system behaves 
in particular, going to look 
stability
