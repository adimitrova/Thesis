hello
and
welcome
to
our
third
glue
lecture
.
to
sort
of
round
out
the
third
week
of
the
course
,
today
's
glue
lecture
is
titled
systems
,
and
i
'm
going
to
talk
kind
of
how
we
think
about
systems
in
this
course
.
and
this
will
be
helpful
for
quiz
3
,
we
'll
do
2
examples
that
are
similar
to
questions
on
the
quiz
.
so
the
goal
of
this
lecture
is
to
think
about
how
inputs
and
outputs
can
define
a
system
,
and
that
's
really
how
we
are
going
to
think
of
systems
in
this
course
.
and
then
,
i
hope
to
kind
of
get
you
used
to
this
matrix
representsation
,
this
states
based
form
of
systems
by
doing
an
example
of
putting
a
second
order
system
into
states
based
form
.
and
to
do
a
linearization
of
a
non-linear
second
order
system
as
well
.
so
first
,
let
's
just
think
for
a
few
minutes
about
what
a
system
is
.
so
,
you
know
,
in
general
,
we
might
think
of
a
satellite
being
a
system
,
as
a
fancy
technological
device
that
,
that
does
something
that
we
design
it
to
do
.
we
might
think
of
it
as
something
that
has
this
kind
of
confusing
block
diagram
.
description
.
we
might
think
of
it
as
something
in
our
car
,
right
or
a
,
or
a
interface
which
was
,
a
technological
interface
that
we
,
we
interact
with..
of
course
there
's
also
the
solar
system
,
that
is
somehow
a
system
of
planets
that
's
working
together
.
that
we
think
of
,
or
systems
of
the
body
,
different
organs
that
work
together
to
perform
basic
functions
.
so
the
point
of
this
slide
is
just
the
idea
that
the
word
system
a
lot
and
we
might
all
have
different
ideas
about
what
a
system
is
and
,
you
know
,
this
course
is
really
kind
of
all
about
systems
.
and
so
i
kind
of
want
to
clarify
what
we
'll
mean
,
and
,
when
we
think
about
them
,
and
the
idea
,
really
is
that
,
in
this
course
,
we
want
to
understand
how
inputs
really
relates
to
outputs
.
and
so
any
of
these
systems
,
we
can
be
considering
different
inputs
,
different
parts
of
the
system
that
we
can
control
or
actuate
on
and
different
outputs
of
the
system
,
different
things
that
we
might
be
measuring
for
different
goals
.
so
you
know
,
on
,
you
know
,
a
satellite
,
you
might
be
controlling
orientation
.
and
so
you
might
think
of
different
inputs
and
outputs
there
,
or
you
might
be
controlling
altitude
,
and
so
now
you
have
different
actuators
,
different
goals
for
the
altitude
than
the
orientation
.
so
we
could
think
of
those
really
in
this
course
,
as
,
as
distinct
systems
that
have
different
control
objectives
.
and
so
the
picture
that
we
're
thinking
about
is
really
this
idea
that
we
have
some
input
here
that
we
're
mapping
to
an
output
defined
by
these
a
,
b
and
c
matrices
.
and
so
getting
into
the
first
example
,
we
're
going
to
talk
about
how
to
move
a
dynamical
equation
that
describes
some
system
into
this
form
that
looks
like
this
.
and
at
first
that
can
be
a
little
bit
tricky
and
so
i
want
to
go
over
it
and
of
course
remembering
that
both
of
these
equations
,
have
some
initial
condition
.
f
of
0
equals
f
not
.
x
of
0
equals
x
not
.
keeping
that
in
mind
,
we
're
just
going
to
think
right
now
about
how
to
go
between
something
that
looks
like
this
to
something
that
looks
like
this
.
and
,
really
that
's
just
a
matter
of
picking
our
state
variables
,
de
,
deciding
what
our
state
is
,
and
then
to/g
choosing
these
inputs
and
outputs
.
so
which
of
these
variables
is
what
we
're
controlling
and
which
of
these
is
what
we
're
measuring
.
and
then
we
're
going
to
write
this
second
order
differential
equation
as
a
pair
of
first
order
ones
,
so
that
our
second
order
system
is
now
represented
in
terms
of
two
first
order
equations
.
and
then
,
put
these
in
terms
of
our
x
,
our
u
,
and
our
y
,
right
?
so
first
,
for
this
example
,
we
'll
select
our
state
to
be
f
and
f
dot
that
's
a
pretty
common
choice
for
,
for
a
state
at
not
necessarily
the
only
choice
,
but
you
'll
see
that
it
's
convenient
because
when
we
think
of
x
dot
,
x
dot
is
going
to
look
like
this
right
?
oops
,
f
double
dot
.
and
now
we
ha
,
we
,
we
need
to
be
able
to
know
something
about
f
double
dot
right
to
for
this
choice
of
state
,
and
so
of
course
we
do
,
and
so
that
's
why
you
'll
see
that
often
as
the
choice
of
the
state
.
and
now
we
pick
our
input
to
be
this
function
p
here
,
so
this
is
somehow
,
someway
that
we
're
influencing
what
f
,
the
,
the
various
derivatives
of
f
are
doing
,
and
now
we
'll
chose
our
output
to
be
f
,
but
again
this
could
be
chosen
as
f
dot
,
this
could
be
chosen
as
both
f
and
f
dot
,
and
that
will
determine
the
form
of
these
a
,
b
,
and
c
matrices
.
so
those
choices
are
important
and
usually
they
are
described
in
the
problem
setup
.
so
now
that
we
have
chosen
our
state
,
our
input
and
our
output
we
need
to
write
this
equation
in
terms
of
two
first
order
equations
.
so
we
can
think
of
f-dot
and
f-double-dot
.
well
now
we
're
going
to
write
them
in
terms
of
our
state
variables
x
1
x
2
in
our
input
and
our
output
.
so
,
here
we
have
f
dot
.
well
that
was
x2
,
right
?
so
we
can
directly
relate
f
dot
in
terms
of
x2
and
now
,
x2
of
course
is
related
to
x1
through
this
,
through
this
time
derivative
.
and
then
for
f
double
dot
,
well
f
double
dot
is
x
two
dot
,
and
this
equation
that
we
were
given
here
.
so
where
i
'm
dividing
by
everything
by
m
,
and
now
i
'm
writing
remember
x
two
is
f
dot
,
so
i
filled
that
in
here
,
and
here
i
'm
filling
in
that
x
one
is
f.
and
here
i
'm
filling
in
that
u
is
p.
so
just
rewriting
this
to
this
.
and
so
now
if
we
come
back
,
this
is
exactly
what
i
had
on
the
last
slide
.
x
dot
in
terms
of
the
other
state
variables
as
we
renamed
them
in
the
first
step
.
and
so
now
it
's
just
a
matter
of
getting
it
to
look
something
like
a
x
plus
b
u
,
right
?
so
i
need
to
pull
out
,
we
need
to
,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
write
an
empty
matrix
,
and
i
know
that
i
want
that
to
be
times
x
,
right
?
so
,
i
write
x
here
,
so
that
's
the
ax
term
.
and
,
now
it
's
time
some
other
matrix
,
this
one
's
going
to
be
tall
and
skinny
,
times
u.
okay
,
so
here
,
i
just
need
to
kind
of
rearrange
these
terms
.
and
here
we
'll
have
,
so
what
,
remember
that
this
is
x
1
dot
,
and
x
2
dot
,
that
we
're
trying
to
equal
.
so
what
does
x
1
dot
equal
?
well
,
it
equals
x
2
,
so
we
just
need
no
x
1
contribution
,
and
1
x
2
contribution
,
and
then
no
u
.
>
>
so
,
now
this
first
line
,
because
,
is
correct
,
right
?
this
x1
gets
multiplied
by
the
first
entry
of
the
matrix
,
x2
gets
multiplied
by
the
second
.
they
get
added
together
,
so
this
all
adds
up
to
x2
.
now
,
for
x2
dot
,
well
that
equals
this
whole
term
.
so
now
we
have
a
contribution
from
x1
,
x2
and
u.
and
that
contribution
for
x
one
is
beta
over
,
and
from
x
two
is
alpha
over
m.
and
now
from
u
,
we
need
to
multiply
u
by
c
,
to
get
this
o
,
over
m
,
to
get
this
term
tied
up
.
so
that
ends
up
looking
like
this
,
right
?
where
this
is
our
a
matrix
,
and
this
is
our
b
matrix
.
and
we
can
do
the
same
thing
for
y.
y
equals
c
x
,
and
since
y
was
f
,
and
f
is
x
one
,
you
get
just
a
one
in
the
,
in
the
entry
of
the
matrix
that
x
one
will
be
multiplied
by
.
so
this
is
how
you
work
.
something
that
looks
like
this
and
to
stay
space
form
,
so
now
we
have
that
our
system
where
we
picked
our
state
,
our
input
,
our
output
its
represented
by
these
three
matrices
a
,
b
and
c.
so
to
pick
up
to
get
into
example
two
.
this
is
going
to
be
an
example
of
linearizing
a
non-linear
system
.
so
this
is
a
system
where
we
have
this
z
squared
term
.
sorry
let
me
fix
my
marker
here
.
so
now
we
have
this
z
squared
term
,
which
means
we
ca
n't
do
what
i
just
did
where
i
wrote
this
empty
a
matrix
and
pulled
out
x
and
just
filled
in
the
indices
right
.
we
have
this
z
squared
term
which
means
it
's
not
going
to
fit
into
that
abc
form
.
and
so
what
we
do
is
we
linearize
it
around
some
operating
point
,
and
here
that
point
is
going
to
be
0
,
0.
and
so
first
what
we
need
to
do
,
of
course
,
is
just
write
this
guy
,
the
second
order
.
differential
equation
in
terms
of
these
2
first
order
equations
.
so
just
i
'm
writing
this
kind
so
that
you
remember
that
x1
dot
because
of
this
twice
that
we
;
re
given
in
the
problem
that
x
and
z
and
z
dot
and
our
input
u
is
tau
.
that
this
is
how
,
that
d
dot
and
d
double
dot
relate
to
x1
dot
and
x2
dot
.
and
so
now
we
have
that
x1
dot
is
x2
,
x2
dot
is
this
whole
thing
because
that
's
what
d
double
dot
is
.
again
writing
it
in
terms
of
our
state
variables
.
but
now
,
again
we
have
this
x1
squared
,
so
we
ca
n't
just
write
this
in
abc
form
.
so
the
way
we
do
it
in
this
case
is
to
just
compute
this
a
matrix
,
this
linearization
.
so
here
we
have
f1
,
f
and
f2
which
are
going
to
be
,
here
's
our
f1
,
here
's
our
f2
.
and
so
we
just
have
to
compute
these
derivatives
in
terms
of
our
stay
variables
.
so
this
first
,
let
's
i
'll
write
it
out
.
for
a
,
we
have
the
derivative
of
this
guy
with
respect
to
x1
.
that
's
0.
now
the
derivative
x2
with
respect
to
x2
.
that
's
1.
now
we
look
at
f2
to
compute
the
second
row
.
derivative
of
x2
with
respect
to
x1
is
2lx1
,
this
term
.
both
of
these
other
two
terms
go
to
zero
,
and
now
f2
in
terms
of
x2
is
just
gamma
,
right
,
because
here
's
the
x2
term
.
and
so
now
this
is
our
a
matrix
evaluated
at
our
operating
point
,
right
?
so
this
term
is
going
to
go
away
,
and
this
whole
thing
is
going
to
equal
zero
,
zero
0,1,0
gamma
,
for
this
choice
of
this
operating
point
.
so
we
're
linearizing
around
that
,
around
that
point
.
in
the
case
of
the
pendulum
,
when
it
's
hanging
down
.
right
?
that
we
're
just
going
to
be
able
to
control
it
around
that
hanging
down
position
.
so
,
in
nicer
text
,
this
is
what
we
have
.
and
we
do
the
same
,
a
very
similar
process
for
the
b
matrix
,
where
now
the
b
matrix
has
a
different
size
,
right
?
but
we
have
the
derivative
f
one
in
terms
of
u
,
and
the
derivative
f
two
in
terms
of
u.
so
that
's
these
two
equations
again
.
and
we
get
this
,
that
this
is
zero
c
,
and
evaluated
at
any
operating
point
this
is
actually
going
to
be
the
same
thing
because
it
's
not
and
a
function
of
any
of
our
state
variables
anymore
.
so
now
,
the
linearization
of
this
system
is
given
by
these
2
matrices
.
and
our
output
is
going
to
be
a
similar
process
,
that
i
think
dr.
iverson
went
over
in
lecture
,
as
well
.
so
with
that
,
good
luck
on
quiz
3
,
and
i
hope
you
're
enjoying
the
course
.
