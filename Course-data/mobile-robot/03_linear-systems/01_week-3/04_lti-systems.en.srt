1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,120
So now we have seen where LTI systems come
from. We've seen non linear models that

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:12,470
turn into very well behaved and pretty LTI
systems. And we've seen non linear models

3
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:18,930
that don't necessarily produce useful LTI
models. But a lot of systems do produce

4
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:23,973
useful LTI models. And it's really our.
Most systematic way of designing

5
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:28,582
controllers. And they are extremely useful
. So even though there aren't that many

6
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:32,912
bananas in the universe. A lot of things
act like bananas. so what we're going to

7
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:37,387
do now is, we're going to start by
understanding how these systems behave. So

8
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,882
what I'm going to do in this lecture is,
I'm actually going to find. The solutions

9
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:47,603
to these systems and once we have those
solutions we can start talking about how

10
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:53,592
they behave. And we're going to start by
simply ignoring the input and ignoring the

11
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:59,251
output. So we're going to start by just
saying that, let's say that I have x dot

12
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:05,925
is Ax and at time t not, this is the time
when we wake up, we start somewhere. So

13
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:10,250
this is the, the physical part of the
system. Not the thing that we bought

14
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:14,795
actuators for. Not the thing that we
bought sensors for. It's just x dot is ax.

15
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:19,650
Let's see what happens in that case. How
does the system behave or drift if you

16
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:25,347
will, when you're not messing with it. So
we need to solve x dot is ax. let's start

17
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,844
with a scalar version of this, where x is
just a number, right? So the scalar

18
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:36,210
version I'm going to write this x dot as
little ax. So this is a scalar version.

19
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:42,119
And I start some Somewhere.
Well, you may not know this, but if you

20
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:50,319
take in or see differential equations, the
solution to this differential equation is

21
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:56,548
actually given by x of t is e to the a, t
minus t not times, times X not. So here,

22
00:01:56,648 --> 00:02:01,043
professor shows up and says, ohhh, this is
the solution to this differential

23
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:05,463
equation. Now you clearly are critical
thinking people who don't just accept

24
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:10,008
anything the professor says, so what you
want to do now is make sure that this is

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,465
indeed correct. So how do you ensure that
what someone feeds you, say here's a

26
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:19,390
solution to differential equation, how do
you make sure that this is correct? How do

27
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:24,040
we know? Well, the first thing you have to
do is make sure that the initial

28
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:28,915
conditions are right. Meaning that, my
solution here actually respects this

29
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:33,705
initial condition. So what I'm going to
do, is, I'm just simply going to plug in t

30
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:39,999
not here, and see what I get. Well, if I
do that, I get x of t not is e to the a. T

31
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:46,044
not minus t not times x not. Well, this
thing is zero, right? So I get e to the

32
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:52,429
power zero x not. And e to the power zero
is always equal to one. So, the

33
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:59,273
exponential evaluated at zero is one. so x
of t not is equal x not. Which means that

34
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:05,751
the initial condition is correct. So we're
done with this. Now, clearly, we need to

35
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:12,055
deal with this, right? We need to make
sure that the dynamics is indeed correct.

36
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:17,835
So now I'm going to take the time
derivative of my proposed solution. So I'm

37
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:23,032
going to take d, dt of this thing, and see
what I get. Well, the time derivative of

38
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:27,751
an exponential. All we do is we pull out
the coefficient there. So we're going to

39
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,790
pull out a, and write an extra a there,
That's all we do. And this is why

40
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:38,033
exponentials are so wonderful. So the time
derivative of x with respect to t is a

41
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:43,579
times what we have here? Well that this
thing, this thing here that's x right. So

42
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:49,189
the prime derivative of x, my proposed x
is equal to a times x. Well that's where

43
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:54,878
we started right. So what we now know is
that the dynamics is correct as well. And

44
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,710
if the initial conditions are right then
the dynamics is right. We know Thanks to

45
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:06,635
the existence and uniqueness of solutions
to differential equations. That this is,

46
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:12,550
indeed, the right solution. Now here is
the kicker. For higher order systems. So

47
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:17,760
now, x is in rn. We get the same solution.
We have x. is e to the at minus t not x

48
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:22,669
not here. Well, now we have this, x dot is
the same thing. The only thing I did

49
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:27,673
different was I wrote capital A instead of
lowercase a. And the thing to keep in mind

50
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:32,217
here is that this is what's called a
matrix exponential, instead of a sc alar

51
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:36,921
exponential, which looks kind of, just a
little scary. But we're not scared of

52
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:41,463
matrix exponentials. In fact, what we do,
is we look up the definition of an

53
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:47,144
exponential. And an exponential, e to the
a t for scalars, well it's simple, simply

54
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:52,982
this sum. This is the definition of what,
the exponential is. Well, here is just

55
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:58,235
multiplications, and we can write
multiplications for matrices as well. So,

56
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:03,923
the definition of a matrix exponential is
just this sum. Now, it turns out that it's

57
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:08,561
actually not that important to us to be
able to compute matrix exponentials very

58
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:13,196
much. However, we need to know where they
come from. And they come from this sum.

59
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:17,372
And the reason why this is useful, it
actually allows us to compute the

60
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:23,272
derivative. Of a matrix exponential. So
let's take the derivative, the time

61
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:29,621
derivative of this whole sum, right? So
this is the sum here. Well the first term

62
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:34,204
that I'm going to do is I'm giong to,
going to pull out the k equal to zero term

63
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,615
here. So then I get A to the power zero
times t to the power zero divided by zero

64
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:40,509
factorial which is one. So this whole
thing is actually equal to one. And now

65
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:45,494
I'm going to take the time derivative of
one well the time derivative of one is a

66
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:50,428
big fat zero. So I'm going to pull out the
first term and then I'm going to take the

67
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,146
derivative, of the remaining terms with
respect to t. So all I get here is I get

68
00:05:56,158 --> 00:06:01,840
an extra k. Well, now I can rewrite
things, I can pull out then a and write

69
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:07,199
everything in terms of k minus 1 instead
of k here. But I'm summing from one to

70
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:13,466
infinity so if I shift my k now to see out
at infinity I get back this thing. So what

71
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,621
this means is that the time derivative of
e to the At is simply big A times E to the

72
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:25,526
At. So the matrix exponential behaves just
like the scalar exponential. That's all I

73
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:30,931
wanted to show with this slide is that,
even though this looks a little awkward,

74
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:36,923
we have these sums of matrix powers, all
it means is that we can take derivative of

75
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:42,453
matrix exponentials and trust that they
behave just like in the scalar case. In

76
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:48,357
fact, e to the a, t minus t not is such a
fundamental object in linear systems

77
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:54,261
theory. That it has, it has been given its
own name. It's known as the state

78
00:06:54,273 --> 00:07:00,357
transition matrix. And sometimes, I'm
actually going to write big pi of t and t

79
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:07,810
not. And what we should then remember, and
probably I will remind you of it, is that

80
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:15,165
this is simply this matrix exponential.
That's all it means, but it will show up

81
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:20,550
quite a bit. Okay.
X dot is Ax. That means, in fact, that x

82
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:26,597
of t is e to the big A, t minus t not. X
of t naught or in general I can write it

83
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:32,190
on this form. It's this state transition
matrix which we now know is just a fancier

84
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,783
name for this matrix exponential. And it
turns out that it doesn't matter if it's t

85
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:43,097
naught or not, it's just whatever time
tao, well we just multiply what x was at

86
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:48,196
that time tao times the state transition
matrix. So this is simply code for x of t

87
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:53,367
is e to the a t minus tau, x at time tau.
So the point is that we know what the

88
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:59,607
solution to, to this equation actually is.
And the way you would show that this is

89
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:04,959
the solution is you would use the
following two properties. And I encourage

90
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:10,978
you to go home and do this. the first is
the thing we just established. Which is

91
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,663
that the time derivative of pi is a tines
oi. The other is that, pi tt is the

92
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:22,303
identity. Well, pi tt I just plug in a t
here instead of a t not. So, then I get e

93
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:27,870
to the power of zero, in the scalier case
that's one, in the matrix case that's the

94
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:33,159
identity matrix. So, that's the only
difference when you go matrix. Fine, so

95
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:38,589
now we actually have a control system. So,
we have x dot is Ax. Plus Bu, what

96
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:44,095
happens? Well again, the professor goes
well, here's my claim, this is what I

97
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:49,551
claim that the solution is. This looks
like a mouthful doesn't it? It doesn't

98
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:55,211
look pleasant at all. Some stuff, in fact
this is the thing we had when we had no B

99
00:08:55,223 --> 00:09:00,510
matrix at all, at all and then we have
thing, thing here that's If you want to be

100
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:05,095
picky this is what's called a convolution,
but, we don't have to be calling it

101
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:09,795
convolution. All w e need to know is that,
you know what this is what we claim the

102
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:14,755
solution is. But how do we actually verify
that this is correct? Well, we do exactly

103
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:19,470
what we did before. We have to check the
initial conditions and the dynamics. So

104
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:24,258
let's plug in t0 see if we get the right
thing. Then we get pi. Instead of t here,

105
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:28,464
I'm going to write t not. And then,
instead of t here and here. I'm going to

106
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:33,153
write t not and t not. Okay.
Let's see what this is. Well, pi tt is

107
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:37,923
equal to the identity matrix, no matter
what t is, right? So this is the identity.

108
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:43,041
Now, here's an integral between t not and
t not. So this is clearly zero. 'because

109
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:47,256
I'm just taking the integral over this.
Individual points.

110
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:53,065
So this interval is zero. So what I have
is I have that x of t not is equal to what

111
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:58,570
it should be, x of t not. So we're going
to declare success on the initial

112
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:04,655
condition. Now, we need to deal with
dynamics and that's harder. First of all,

113
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,285
we use the fact that if I take the
derivative of this, I get an A out. So the

114
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:14,291
first component is no big deal. But then
we have this awkward object here. We have

115
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:19,025
to take the derivative of an integral,
with respect to t, when t shows up both

116
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:24,174
here and here. And this, it's not a
trivial thing. In fact, what you need to

117
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:28,118
do, is you need to use something known as
rule.

118
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:32,801
That tells us that if I have a general
function here of t and tau and I take the

119
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:37,206
derivative of this thing with respect to
t. Well, first this contribution here

120
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:42,058
translates into plugging in, instead of
tau I am plugging in t and then I am just

121
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,674
getting rid of the integral. That's the
first piece.The other piece is I pooled d

122
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:51,748
dt inside the interval and I have to take
the reverse of this thing. With respect to

123
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,245
t. So this is technically what we have to
do to compute this. So let's do that.

124
00:10:57,363 --> 00:11:03,160
Well, f t, t. Well, let's pull it, pull
out this thing, and evaluate it at tau is

125
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:07,997
equal to t o' clock. Then I get phi t, t
times bu of t. Which, in fact, is simply u

126
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:14,459
of b, u of t, right? Because this thing is
density matrix And then, I get the time

127
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:19,168
derivative of this thing. Or, in other
words, the derivative of this with respect

128
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,901
to t. Well, I know that that's an a that I
just have to pull out in the beginning. So

129
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:28,332
this is a little bit of a mouthful, I
realize, to that. So, take a deep breath,

130
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:32,852
and redo this computation, just so that
you believe it. But what happens when

131
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:37,321
you've done this, then. Is, you can
actually pull out the a, and find that the

132
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:43,358
time derivative of my. Proposed x is, big
A, times this whole thing, plus B times u.

133
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:49,509
And now, this whole thing is equal to the
same thing here. So instead of writing

134
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:55,745
this rather awkwards big expression, I'm
just going to write, x sub t here. Or in

135
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:01,965
other words, d, xdt is ax plus bu which,
which is where we started. So we can

136
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:08,690
declare success also on the dynamics. So
to summarize, after all these pushups, and

137
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:14,845
I realize that today's lecture was a
little bit of a it was a little thorny in

138
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:19,795
terms of all the integrals and
derivatives. In fact, it was much thornier

139
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:25,620
than anything we've ever seen before. The
reason I needed to do it was not because I

140
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:29,180
think you guys need to be world champions
at applying rule.

141
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:35,195
I just want to be able to say the
following. That if I have x dot is ax plus

142
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:38,677
bu. Y is cx.
Then I can write y of t as C times x of t

143
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:45,783
where we computed the solution. So we
actually know that the output is given by

144
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:52,269
this thing in yellow here and you know
what? Let's add another sweetheart to

145
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:58,885
this. So all these push ups just ended up
with us being able to write. Explicitly

146
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:03,774
what the solution is. Now, we're not going
to be able to or particularly interested

147
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:08,763
in actually computing this at all. But we
need to know it to move forward. So at the

148
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:14,171
end of this application of rule, what we
ended up with was an expression for the

149
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:19,220
output or the state if you want to Get rid
of the c matrices of this general LTI

150
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:25,190
system. And fi here, the thing to remember
is that phi known as the state transition

151
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:30,950
matrix was simply given by this matrix
exponential. What we're going to do now in

152
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:36,599
the next lecture is see h ow does this
actually translate into us. Being able to

153
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:41,376
say things about how the system behaves.
And in particular, we're going to look at

154
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:41,977
stability.
