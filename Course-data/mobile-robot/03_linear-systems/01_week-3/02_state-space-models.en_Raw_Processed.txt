welcome to second lecture lti 
models state space forum, lti 
stood linear timeinvariant systems 
we saw last time is that we could 
model least two systems like x dot is 
ax plus bu y is cx well, turns 
that this is a very, general 
description a large class systems 
x here is state system 
that means is that x describes 
system is currently doing, u is input 
tells us we effect system, 
y is output measures 
aspects system that we care 
that we access to somehow 
way we think a, b, 
c matrices really that, here, ax, 
well, thats physics system 
so, a is given to us newton, 
laws physics electromechanics, 
whatever is that using to model 
system theres little we 
that b, hand, that 
tells us input affects state 
meaning, this tells us actuators we 
so, if we buy new actuators, we get 
a bigger b in words, b is, to a 
certain degree, to us, designers 
actually building systems 
similarly, c, actually encodes 
sensors we meaning, how, we 
actually get information whats 
going inside system so, a is 
given typically, b c redesigned 
we designed system we will see 
later sometimes, we may enough 
control authority, instance, to make 
system we want, meaning b 
matrix is measly means that we 
to buy a better b matrix, maybe buy a 
new actuator so end 
day, a system like this, influenced 
control signal u, thats input, 
comes y, is ultimately 
thing we see we typically see 
x, we see y, thats 
sensors measuring 
question that control theory is 
really about, is we pick this input 
to make system 
and, importantly, since we 
measure y we pick u, 
given y unfortunately, we cannot answer 
that question right away we need 
to first is understand systems a 
little bit come tools 
describing behaviors until 
we understand behaviors, we cant 
pick us that make behaviors 
we want to so going to 
that first, we actually need to 
understand a little bit 
systems come so, lets start 
old friend, car model this 
model we used we built 
cruise controller a car so, whats 
going here is that, acceleration 
car, v dot, c m times u minus 
gamma v so, lets put this model state 
space form well, lets say, first 
that, building a cruise controller 
all, we care is velocity in 
this case, lets say, that state is 
actually velocity thing 
measuring is velocity, means 
that y is cx, c is simply , 
alright 
simply measuring one well, v dot is 
giving this expression means that 
x dot, x is v is 
ax a here is simply minus gamma, plus 
bu, b become c m so, in 
this case, we a onedimensional 
system describing whats going 
now, lets pretend that instead 
building a cruise controller, well 
building a selfdriving car well, 
clearly, we care fast 
going, we care is so, 
in this case, lets make state, 
position velocity, so p, v in 
this case, measuring position c, 
means taking first 
component state so, c is , 
similarly, this equation still holds so 
controlling is acceleration 
cm remains is a 
matrix here simply says, that 
time derivative position is 
velocity then, this gamma is 
gamma we got so, impo rtant 
point to note here is that model we 
end with, to a certain degree, depends 
we care 
things that we can, measure now, 
lets take another model here is a 
pendulum pendulum is attached 
here ceiling somewhere 
swinging an angle theta 
length l acceleration this 
angle, this angular acceleration, turns 
to minus gravity length 
times sine this angle plus cu 
way we interpret this is that 
is actually applying a 
torque here that allows us to swing 
pendulum a certain way okay 
lets write this an lti system ouch 
sine theta is linear so, we actually 
cannot write this an lti system but, 
here is something we observe a 
very, small thetas, sine theta is 
actually roughly equal to theta so 
we small angles, is actually 
replace this thing theta 
so, lets that small angles then, 
we get is, wellm if we measure 
angle, y is simply , , 
taking angle angle 
velocity state, in this case, 
is theta, theta dot 
well, similarly, a c here, so 
c shows there in b matrix, 
a matrix looks like this , here, 
means that time derivative 
angle is angle velocity, 
this g l term here is 
g l term there so, this would 
a, b, c matrices this 
pendulum 
again, i want to encourage you to go 
math perform this matrix 
multiplications so that you indeed trust 
that this is correct okay, lets 
another example two simple robots lets 
say that we two robots a line 
we is we control 
velocities robots so, x is 
position robot , x is position 
robot , we want to somehow control 
well, first all, we get is 
that x dot is , u we a 
matri x in this case, a is equal to 
b matrix is simply identity 
matrix lets say that we match 
robots are, too, so in that case, y 
would simply identity matrix times 
x, x itself, right so, this would 
be, our, model this now, lets 
solve problem here lets solve whats 
called rendezvous problem 
rendezvous problem is problem well 
robots meet and, you know 
what, dont we actually 
drive towards so, heres an 
idea one we say that u is 
x minus x, is simply code 
saying that x is going to move towards 
x similarly, u, lets make that x 
minus x then, that means that robot is 
aiming towards robot well, weve 
actually done now, is weve designed a 
closed loop feedback law, we 
written control inputs in terms 
states in this case, since outputs 
states, actually 
writing in terms outputs 
well, if i that, i get a new system x 
dot is negative , , , negative , x, 
this corresponds to is instead 
writing u here, im plugging in 
things there, you end a 
new system dynamics thats whats called a 
closed loop system dynamics and, in fact, 
if i run this, lets run 
robots a gazillion robots here, 
you will see, running exactly this 
simple controller makes robots 
actually meet a same, 
point, so thats kind cool lets 
another example this is unicycle 
robot we looked that we modeled 
differential drive robot again, sines 
cosines unpleasant this is 
linear, alright , cosine small 
angles is equal to so, lets assume 
dealing small angles sine, 
small angles, is equal to angle 
so, using that, we get this 
look this this is still linear 
here, we a multiplication 
so, even we made a simplification, wh 
ich way is a completely stupid 
simplification pendulum may 
swing small angles, 
car to drive in direction 
we small angles that doesnt 
make sense point there is 
that this kind simplification didnt 
anything still linear so, we need to 
a little bit systematic we 
generate linear time invariant models 
from, for, kinds nonlinear 
systems saying that let 
angle small hope best, 
wont actually give us that much 
in next lecture, we will systematic 
in generation linear 
timeinvariant models
