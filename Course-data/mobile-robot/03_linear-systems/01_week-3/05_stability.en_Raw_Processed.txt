so in previous lecture, we a lot 
technical push ups to end end 
a description solution 
to a general lti system is reason 
that is, is that i really, really enjoy 
rule, even though i that will 
actually help us to characterize 
systems today, i want 
to talk stability, you 
probably recall we a control 
design, first order business is to 
design controllers so that systems dont 
blow if blow up, theres nothing 
we quad rotors 
fall air robots drive 
to infinity cars smash things 
we dont want to blow up, 
deciding objectives almost always 
layered in this sense first order 
business is stability we want to 
track whatever reference character 
reference point we we also want 
to robust to parameter uncertainties, 
possibly noise we wrap 
objectives around it, like you 
want to move fast, quickly you can, 
use little energy youre 
moving, things like this but, 
regardless which, stability is always 
first order business so lets 
start scalar systems, inputs so 
a matrix now, in this case x dot 
is little ax, means that 
scalar well solution x is e 
to a, we said minus naught x 
naught here i simply picked naught to 
equal to so this is solution 
okay, lets plot this solution looks 
like if a is positive, x 
starts nicely pabaah its, 
blowing far i tell so if a 
is positive this system blows well, if 
a is negative, e to at, this is a 
decaying exponential so we get x to 
go, , nice to zero happens if a 
is zero in between well, you 
e to zero t, is so then, 
x is simply equal to x naught x 
never changes 
so here, didnt blow up, didnt 
actually go to zero in fact, 
we its, really a sitution 
three possible things happen you 
blow up, you go to zero, you stay 
put so lets talk three 
cases first case is is called 
asymptotic, stability so system is 
asymptotically stable if x goes to zero 
initial conditions, so this fancy 
upside a, is known universal 
quantifier we need to know is that 
we see upside a way we 
pronounce is x nought so 
asymptotic stability means that we go to 
zero almost always we want to 
design system so that x actually goes 
to matter we start, thats 
asymptotically stability you 
recall, in scalar case, a strictly 
negative corresponds to asymptotically 
stability we unstability, 
instability system 
unstable that means is there exists 
an initial condition, so flipped e, 
to speak existential 
quantifier, we read exists so 
unstable if there exists so many 
extra conditions system 
actually blows in scaler case, we 
a positive corresponding to 
instability we something we 
call critical stability, is somehow 
in between system doesnt blow 
doesnt go to zero either, in 
fact, scalar system, this 
corresponded, corresponded to the, a equal 
to zero case so if you summarize that, if 
you a scalar system a positive 
means system is unstable a negative 
means that system is asymptotically 
stable, is code saying that 
state goes to zero a zero means 
critically stable okay 
let use this way thinking 
matrix case x is ax, capital a so this 
is now, x is a vector, a is a matrix 
we there well, we cant say 
oh, a is positive, a is negative 
a is a matrix positive 
negative we is we 
go next best thing, is 
eigenva lues 
and, in fact, almost always, intuition 
you get a scalar system translates 
behavior eigenvalues 
matrices you 
dont know eigenvalues are, 
special things that associated 
matrices so, if i a matrix a n 
n, i multiply a vector an n 
vector, if i write 
vector times a scalar, this 
means is that way that a acts this 
vector is basically scaling 
scaling factor is given lambda if i 
can, if i find lambda v to satisfy 
this, i is a lambda that is 
called an eigenvalue actually 
a real number typically a 
complex number so a, a slightly 
general object a real number, 
thats an eigenvalue v is known 
an eigenvector eigenvalues 
eigenvectors really fundamental 
objects in, in youre dealing 
matrices you want to understand 
behave and, whenever you think 
scalar first, you almost always 
translate eigenvalues, 
eigenvalues systems and, 
eigenvalues actually would tell you 
matrix a acts in directions eh 
eigenvectors so, you almost think 
scalar systems in directions 
different eigenvectors and, you 
know, sometimes you may want to compute 
eigenvalues i dont 
so, if you use matlab you would 
write, eiga, pops 
eigenvalues whatever software you, 
comfortable with, you want to use c, 
python, whatever, there is almost 
always a library that allows you to 
compute eigenvalues and, command is 
typically something like eiga 
so, this would give you eigenvalues 
are, given a particular matrix okay 
lets see this actually means lets 
take a simple example here heres a 
system , , o minus if you take eig a 
this you get eigenvalue 
eigenvalue negative 
correspo nding eigenvectors , , 
, okay 
this mean actually means 
following so lets say that this is x, 
this is x okay 
v , so this this direction 
so here is what, v is this is 
direction in v is pointing well, 
eigenvalue there is negative , 
means that, if you recall scalar 
system, a negative, we 
stability so if i start here, 
trajectory is going to pull to 
zero nice stable, in fact, if i 
start here, going to pull to 
zero, nice stable right 
so, if im starting x axis, 
system is well behaved if i start 
x axis, i lambda positive, 
corresponds to little a 
positive in scalar case, means 
that system actually blows so, 
here, system goes to infinity 
and, in fact, if i start here, x 
component is going to shrink x 
component is going to go to infinity 
so i is this is system 
actually looks like so eigen vectors 
in this case will tell happens 
along different dimensions of, 
system so this, if i x 
dot big ax, i find a solution, 
system is asymptotically stable, 
if if, scalar case, we 
that little a to negative 
we need in matrix case is that 
real part, remember that lambda 
complex, real part lambda is 
strictly negative eigenvalues to 
a all, this is asymptotic 
stability means linear systems 
unstable means that there is one more, 
one single bad eigenvalue spoils 
whole bunch so a single eigenvalue that 
positive real part this is an, a 
sufficient condition instability 
we critical stability if so this 
is a, a necessary condition that says 
real part to less equal to 
igon values we 
going to spending time is typically 
here in asymptotically stabl e 
domain, we want to do, is we 
want to design system 
controllers in a way that closed 
loop system is asymptotically stable so 
going to somehow make eigen 
values negative real part thats 
going to one design objectives 
that interested in i want to 
point something critical 
stability that if one eigenvalue is 
rest eigenvalues negative 
real part, if you two purely 
imaginary eigenvalues so real 
part, rest negative real 
part, you critical stability 
we will actually see that a little bit 
later on, thing that i really want 
to take, you to take you based 
this slide, is, you look a matrix, 
you compute eigenvalues if real 
part eigenvalues negative 
youre free clear, system is 
asymptotically stable if one 
eigenvalues positive real part, you 
toast, system blows that is bad 
so, lets end a tale two pendula 
here is normal pendula, well if you 
compute this, you get this matrix 
eigenvalues j negative j 
well, i dont know if you remember, 
previous slide, there a bullet 
that said if you purely imaginary 
eigenvalues, we here we 
purely imaginary eigenvalues 
more, we critical stability 
this actually means is that, this 
pendulum, clearly, there is friction 
grav, damping here going to 
oscillate forever going to blow 
its, , excuse 
going to go to zero going 
to keep oscillating forever ever 
critically stable system 
now, lets look inverted pendulum 
im moving base, in that 
case, a is we already know, this 
things is going to fall right so, 
if you compute eigen values you get 
one eigen value to equal to negative 
to positive , means that, 
we one rothton eigenvalue this 
eigenvalue thats going to spoil 
system so this in an unstable system so 
that we understand that eigenvalues 
really matter, really influence 
behavior system, lets see, , 
excuse me, we use this to 
advantage we control design
