1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,897
In this lecture, we're going to, dig a
little bit deeper into the original non

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:09,753
linear models. And see, how do we produce
linear models from them? And in fact, I

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:14,418
have a wonderful quote here. That says,
classifying systems as linear and non

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,508
linear is like classifying objects in the
universe. As bananas and non-bananas. What

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,787
this means is that if you're walking
around in the universe, let's say your'e

6
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,969
on Jupiter and you pick up something,
chances are it ain't going to be a banana.

7
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:32,495
Similarly, if you walk around and you pick
up a system or a robot, chances are it

8
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:36,982
ain't going to be linear. What that means
is that linear systems are really, really

9
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:41,876
rare. Yet, here I am, two lectures ago,
bragging about how useful they are. So

10
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:46,789
something's gotta give here. And what it
is, is that the non linear systems that

11
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,974
are everywhere. They act very much linear,
at least around operating points. So the

12
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:56,676
linearization is a way of producing linear
models from non linear models. Or

13
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:01,521
producing bananas from non-bananas, if you
want. So what we're going to do in this

14
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:08,287
lecture is. Produce Linearizations or
linear models from the non-linear models

15
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:16,188
that we start with. So, here is a general
non-linear model . So, x dot is now not a

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,454
x plus bu with some general function f of
x and u, and similarly y is not a simple

17
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:26,844
plus in cx, it's a non-linear function h
of x. Okay.

18
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:30,995
So now, what we would like to do, is we
would like to find some kind of local

19
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:35,457
description of what this system is doing.
And this local description needs to be

20
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,960
linear, and what I mean by local, is that
we have to pick an operating point. In the

21
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:44,934
pendulum we said, let's assume that the
pendulum is hanging very close to straight

22
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:49,804
down, so straight down is the operating
point and then what we do is we are going

23
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:54,767
to have to define a new variable. So,
let's say that this is my operating point.

24
00:01:55,012 --> 00:02:00,086
This in the pendulum case would be, the
angle is zero, and I have no control

25
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:05,881
input. Well then, my actual state is going
to be the operating point, plus some small

26
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:11,069
deviation in this state. Similarly my
control input is going to be, well the

27
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:17,708
nominal operating Input point plus a small
deviation. And, what we would like to do

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,346
somehow is describe these small
variations. And in fact, the new equations

29
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:30,557
of motion that we care about well, we're
going to care about how Delta x. This

30
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,398
deviation from the operating point
behaves. Well, delta x is x minus x

31
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,928
operating point. Right? So delta x dot is
x dot minus xl dot. Well, this thing is

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,073
equal to zero, because it's a constant,
right? So this is just zero. So, here's my

33
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:51,834
zero. So, delta x dot is the same. As x
dot. Well, I know what x dot is, it's

34
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:58,314
this. So, now delta x dot becomes this.
Okay, let's see if we somehow can simplify

35
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:05,070
this. So this is my model, now luckily for
me there's is something known as a tail or

36
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:11,203
expansion that's allows me to write this
On a simpler form. So this thing can be

37
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:17,222
written as f evaluated at the operating
point, times this partial derivative of f

38
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:23,839
with respect to x, also evaluated at the
operating point, this is known as . And

39
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:28,945
then, you have the same partial
derivative, but now with respect to u,

40
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:35,287
evaluated at the operating points. And, we
multiply this with Delta u here, and delta

41
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,832
x here. And then I have something that I
call HOT, which stands for higher order

42
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:44,956
terms. So this is where, we're saying that
the higher order terms. Where, when delta

43
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:49,551
x and delta u become large, these matter.
But for small delta x and delta u, they

44
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:55,867
really don't matter. Well why is this
useful? Well, first of all lets assume

45
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,599
that we have picked operating points, so
that f of x0, u0 is zero which that we're

46
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:07,356
holding the state steady, x dot is zero at
this point which means that this thing

47
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:10,991
goes away. Now.
Let's call these guys A and B. Why is

48
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:15,619
that? Well, these are just matrices
because I'm plugging in some constant

49
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:20,573
value here. Similarly then I'm plugging in
a constant value. So, these partial

50
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:25,671
derivatives are just matrices. Well, let's
call them A and B. And now let's do the

51
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:30,262
same thing with Y. Y was the output. We
want to kn ow what it looks like around

52
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:35,225
this operating point. Well, we have the
same thing here, plus this term, plus high

53
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:40,056
order terms. So, let's assume that thing
is zero, so let's assume that we pick an

54
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:44,878
operating point that kills the output at
that operating point. So, the output is

55
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,273
zero at that point. Well, then, let's call
this thing c. Right? Now I have a, b, and

56
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:55,493
c. And in fact, let's summarize what we
just did. If I have this non-liner model,

57
00:04:55,603 --> 00:05:00,663
and I pick an operating point, so that
these two assumptions are satisfied. And

58
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:05,979
then I look at small deviations from the
operating point. Then I can write delta x

59
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:10,875
dot. That's a delta x plus b delta u.
Which is linear. And y is c delta x, where

60
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:16,275
these a, b, and c matrices are given by
these partial derivatives, also known as

61
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:21,875
Jacobians. So this, ladies and gentlemen,
is how you obtain linear models from non

62
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:27,125
linear systems. Well, let's actually do
some computations here, just to know

63
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:33,672
what's going on. So let's assume that x is
in Rm. u is an Rm, y is an Rp and we have

64
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:41,527
f and a being given by these things, but
really what we have is f1 over x or is

65
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:48,720
actually a function of x1 to xn of u1 to
up right, no sorry Alright.

66
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:52,455
So when I just write f1, that's what's a
really mean. Okay.

67
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:57,850
Then, df, dx. This Jacobian that we talked
about. The first one we need. Well, it has

68
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:02,685
this form. First component is the
derivative of f1, with respect to x1. Then

69
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:07,875
it's f1 with respect to x2, and so forth.
And the reason why I'm writing this is not

70
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:12,940
because I enjoy producing complicated
PowerPoint slides. It's just, we need to

71
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:18,916
know what the different entries are. And
it's important to do this right because

72
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:24,476
otherwise your dimensions don't line up
when you produce your A, B, and C

73
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:30,211
matrices. So that's df dx or, as we now
know it, A. This is my A matrix. Well,

74
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:36,353
similarly, B is df du, right? And again,
the first component is df1 du1. This

75
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:42,579
component is the f1, the Here, we have the
f and the u1. All the way to the f and the

76
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:48,477
So this is a n by m matrix, which is what
we needed. And, in fact , this is the b

77
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:54,093
matrix, then. So it has the right
dimension. And not surprisingly, we do the

78
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:59,192
same thing for our c matrix. and the
reason again I wanted to show this is,

79
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:03,976
this is where the Jacobians come from. So
if I write dhdx, this is what I mean.

80
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,835
Good.
Let's do some examples. So let's start

81
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:11,036
with what's known as the inverted
pendulum, which is a slightly more

82
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:15,974
complicated pendulum where what I have is,
I have a moving base, my elbow in this

83
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:21,244
case. And then I have a pendulum pointing
straight up. Or with some angle, and by

84
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:26,671
moving the base, the pendulum is going to
swing, and in fact, it's going to fall if

85
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:32,676
I don't do anything very clever. But the
dynamics of this can be written like this,

86
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:37,482
where theta double dot is g over l sin
theta plus u cos theta. Okay.

87
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:43,253
Let's linearize this thing. the first
thing we do is we pick our stakes. In this

88
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:48,120
case it's going to be theta and theta dot.
And the reason I know that I have a

89
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:52,912
2-dimensional system is I have two dot's
up here. So, I have a 2-dimensional

90
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:58,283
system, x1 is theta and x2 is theta dot.
Let's say they're measuring the angles, so

91
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:03,536
y is x1. Well, then I get my f to be this
two vector. And I get my h of x to be x1.

92
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:07,481
Okay, fine.
Let's pick the operating point where the

93
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:13,252
pendulum is pointing straight up, and I'm
doing nothing. And in that case, well,

94
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,662
what is my a matrix? My a matrix becomes
df1, dx1. So now I have to take the

95
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:24,053
derivative of this thing here, with
respect to x1. There is no x1 there, so.

96
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:29,955
The first component is zero. Then I have
to take the derivative of this thing with

97
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:35,335
respect to x2, which is 1. So this
component is 1. Similarly, I have to take

98
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:41,195
the derivative of f2, with respect to x1.
So now, I have to take derivative of this

99
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:46,765
guy here with respect to x1. Well, the
derivative of this with respect to x1 is.

100
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:53,345
g over l times sine. The derivative of
that is going to be g over l times cosine

101
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:59,745
x1. While the derivative of this, with
respect to x1 is actually going to be

102
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:06,795
negative u, sine x1. But I didn't actually
write this here, even though I should

103
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,660
have. Arguably.
Because what I'm going to do is I'm going

104
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:15,807
to evaluate this at the operating point.
And you know what? U is zero. And in fact,

105
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:20,906
x1 is zero. So this term actually goes
away. So all I'm left with is this term,

106
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:26,322
evaluated at zero, zero. And cosine zero
is 1. So after all these pushups, I end up

107
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:30,793
with g over l here, as the known zero
term. Now, that's how you get the A

108
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:35,477
matrix. Again, I would encourage you to go
home, and thus your already home when you

109
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:39,950
are watching this and actually perform
these computations so you know where they

110
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:44,867
come from. Similarly B, you have to do the
same computation and in this case you have

111
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,235
no U up here, so you don't get a U in the
first component. Here you have U cosine

112
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:54,260
x1. Take a derivative of that with respect
to U. We get cosine x1. We plug in the

113
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:59,785
operating point, zero, zero. And wind up
with this elegant b vec-, b vector here. C

114
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:05,585
is particularly simple, right? Because h
of x is x1. Which means that c is simply

115
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,821
1, 0. So.
That was how we would go about getting

116
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:13,456
these a, b, and c matrices. Okay, lets go
to the unicycle the differental drive

117
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:18,283
robot that we have looked at that we saw
in the previous lecture that we had a

118
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:23,778
little bit of an issue with. first of all
lets figure out the state. Let's say that

119
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,849
x1 x now I'm having in the slight abuse of
n notation right because x is also the

120
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:35,258
full statement. But this is the x
component, x2 is y and x3 is theta and

121
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:41,362
then lets say that we're actually
measuring everything. So y is this. Okay

122
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:47,412
We can control the translational velocity,
or the speed and the angular velocity,

123
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:52,434
right? So my inputs would be u1 is v, and
u2 is omega. Okay.

124
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:58,018
Let's compute, now, the linearization
around x, operating point to zero. U,

125
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:03,069
operating point is zero. Okay.
If you do that, what you actually end up

126
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:07,062
with, and I'm not going to show the
different steps, you should do it

127
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:11,850
yourself, is first of all, an A matrix
that's 0, a B matrix that looks like this,

128
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:16,750
and a C matrix that's dead end to the
matrix, which is not surprising since we'

129
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,520
re measuring both the x y position and the
orientation of, of the robot. Now, this is

130
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:29,051
a little bit weird. Because if I write
down the, the dynamics for x2. Well, x2

131
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:34,845
dot it's going to be given by the second
row of everything. Well, first of all,

132
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:40,698
it's zero, right? Because my a matrix is
zero. Then I get zero, zero times u. So I

133
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,071
get plus zero, zero. I mean, times u, if
you want. But this means that x2. is

134
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:52,224
actually eqaul to zero. Well x2 was the y
direction, what this means is if I'm

135
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:58,129
pointing my robot straight in the x
direction, then apparently I cannot

136
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:04,388
actually make the car drive in the y
direction. That seems a little bit fishy

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,166
actually. what is going on here is that
the linearization That we performed didn't

138
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:16,203
quite capture all the nitty gritty
exciting things that were going on with

139
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:21,442
the non linear model. And this is an
example where the non-linearities are so

140
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:27,340
severe, that the linearization as applied
directly, doesn't entirely apply. Because

141
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:31,127
we lost control over the y direction. Even
though.

>> If I have a car, I can clearly turn it.
I can drive it and turn, and drive in the

143
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:40,577
Y directions. So, here's an example where
the linearization actually doesn't give us

144
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,247
just what we wanted. And, the punch line
here is that sometimes linearizations give

145
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:50,039
reasonable models, with inverted pendulum,
for instance. And, sometimes they do not,

146
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:54,901
with the unicycle. and with a unicycle we
have to be a little bit more care,

147
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:59,957
careful, but the fact that I want to point
out though is that when they work. When

148
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:04,337
the linear stations work they are
remarkably useful. Even though we're

149
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:09,134
finding them around the operating points
they seem to work Better than what we

150
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:13,837
really theoretically have reason to
believe, which is why we do a lot of

151
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:19,155
analysis of the linearizations rather than
the non-linear models. And then take what

152
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,990
we learned from the linearizations and
apply it to the, the non-linear models.

Thank you.
