welcome, i glad to see you back 
this lesson 
in this video we will discuss 
details contiki implements 
network communication 
end lesson you 
understand structure 
functioning contikis 
communications stack 
perhaps best question 
to start this lecture is, 
is communication in contiki 
answering this question, 
we going to talk communication 
in wireless sensor networks 
communication plays an essential role 
in wireless sensor network system 
basically, communication in a wireless 
sensor network architecture 
includes three parts 
sensor nodes, a gateway, 
backend system 
sensors collect data 
send to gateway wirelessly 
depending network characteristics, 
a particular communication 
protocol is used 
example, wifi 
bluetooth used 
sending data sensor 
nodes to a getaway 
data is forward via 
internet reach cloud 
finally endusers access data 
use services offered cloud 
in this lecture, 
we will focus communication 
between sensor nodes gateway 
in words, communication 
between devices using contiki 
in contiki, 
communication is implemented a service 
therefore features 
contiki services, 
run time replacement 
a result, allows to simultaneously 
load multiple communication stacks 
this helps to reduce latency 
loading modules one one 
in addition, this feature used 
comparing different 
communication protocols 
to a better understanding 
protocols, 
we will explore in 
depth later in this video 
now, we going to focus 
loosely coupled communication 
stack in contiki 
communication in contiki may 
divided different services 
communication stack 
uses synchronous events 
to communicate a program application 
here, an interesting question is, 
using synchronous events instead 
asynchronous events, polling 
answer is that is possible 
to use a single buffer 
communication processing, 
since is necessary that synchronous 
event handlers run to completion 
this approach ensures that there is 
need to copy data to intermediate buffers 
bias drivers operate between 
communication stack hardware 
device drivers would in come in packets, 
place 
communication buffer call 
upper layers communication service 
communication service is awaken, 
inspects packet in buffer 
based content packet header, 
service searches 
application is 
destination packet 
finds exact application, 
posts a synchronous event 
to that application program 
receiving event generated 
communication stack, 
application program 
proceeds to process packet 
in cases, is necessary 
application program to replay 
posting data to communication 
stack returning control to 
then, communication stack 
takes control, places reply 
in communication buffer 
appends header to outgoing packet 
finally, gives control 
to device driver, so 
that packet transmitted 
understanding big picture 
contikis communication stack, 
lets examine 
structure detail 
there two types communication 
stacks in contiki, micro ip rime 
in this lesson, we will discuss rime 
leave micro ip next video 
is rime communication stack 
rime is a lightweight communication 
stack a layered design 
complex communication 
protocols reuse simpler ones 
using rime there is rule 
that compels an application 
to go layers 
stack in order to communicate 
instead use primitive 
protocol that requires 
single hop 
multihop communication primitives 
fully supported in 
contikis rime communication stack 
however there is packet routing in 
multihub communication primitives 
this task is specified application 
upper layer protocol 
one benefits rime stack is that 
users implement protocols, 
belong to 
rime top 
so lets take a look 
primitives available in set 
communication abstractions in glide 
first is singlehop broadcast 
senders address is 
added to outgoing packet 
sending to 
local area neighbors 
we singlehop unicast, 
is used to send packets 
to a specific destination 
reliable unicast is another 
type singlehop unicast that 
repeatedly sends a packet to a particular 
destination while waiting 
an acknowledgement packet 
receiver 
finally, multihop unicast 
primitive is used sending packets 
to an identified node in network 
is located several hops away 
in this case, a rooting function must 
provided application 
protocol to choose 
next hop destination 
this is end 
lesson contiki communication 
ground communication stack 
now, i hope you a deeper 
understanding way contikis 
communication is structured 
works 
see you in next video
