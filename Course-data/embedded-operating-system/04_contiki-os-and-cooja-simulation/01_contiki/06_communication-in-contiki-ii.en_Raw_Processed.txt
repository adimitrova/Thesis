hello 
i glad to see you back this lesson 
this time we will explore details 
micro ip communication 
stacking contiki 
end lesson, 
you understand benefits 
challenges using contikis 
micro ip communication stack 
micro ip stack is a communication 
library provided in contiki 
supporting tcpip protocols 
small microcontrollers 
benefits using micro 
ip stack small code size 
that requires a few 
hundred bytes ram 
although is lightweight, is 
important to notice that necessary rfc 
requirements affecting host to 
host communication fulfilled 
however, complicated communication 
mechanisms removed micro 
ip in order to make suitable 
embedded systems 
example, 
soft error reporting mechanism 
dynamically configurable type 
service bids tcp connections 
present since 
mechanisms required 
in wireless sensor 
network applications 
is important to notice 
that removing services 
affect quality service 
micro ip stack 
executed either a task 
in a multitasking system main 
program in a single task system 
in multitasking implementations, 
is common to implement two tests 
first one is constantly checking 
incoming packets 
whereas second one is verifying 
occurrence a periodic timeout 
a packet arrives, 
micro ip input function is called 
receiving application may 
create a message replying 
periodic timeouts play important roles 
in tcp many activities 
functions require this information 
performing task 
example, retransmission round trip 
time estimation requires periodic timers 
instead using explicit dynamic memory, 
micro ip uses a single global buffer 
restoring incoming packets a fixed 
table holding connection state 
size global buffer is designed 
to fit maximum size a packet 
a message reaches to a destination, 
message is stored in global 
buffer wait a tcpip stack 
in cases packet contains data, 
tcpip stack 
will notify appropriate 
application to process data 
application incoming 
packet is targeted to immediately 
process data copy to 
another buffer future processing 
global buffer is used 
incoming 
outgoing packets, well headers 
therefore, this tech use part 
buffer that is reserved 
headers a temporary memory dealing 
applications sending dynamic data 
memory footprint 
implementing micro ip varies dramatically 
depending application 
example, there less requirements 
in terms memory usage 
a simple telnet server 
complex applications 
perform complicated tasks 
is possible to implement micro 
ip a low memory overhead 
example, memory 
size less bytes 
however, this implementation will affect 
features reduce service quality 
to interact micro ip stack, 
an application program interface 
api is used 
api comprises a set software 
functions to make application 
development easier 
currently, bsd socket api seems to 
one popular apis 
tcpip, since is used in many unix 
linux systems 
however, bsd api is suitable 
micro ips tech due to requirements 
support an underlying 
multitasking operating system 
overhead memory usage 
instead using a bsd api, 
contiki provides two simple apis 
that include protosockets a simpler 
version bsd low overhead 
similar to rhyme stack, micro ip 
stack is designed in ledgered fashion, 
functionality will 
performed a particular protocol 
while interactions between protocol 
layers strictly defined 
using layerds structure designing 
protocols stacks is a good approach 
however, is ideal 
implementing 
in micro ip, 
protocol implementations tightly 
coupled in order to save code space 
this is end lesson 
contikis micro ip communication stack 
i hope you a good idea 
structure contikis micro ip stack 
works 
thanks watching
