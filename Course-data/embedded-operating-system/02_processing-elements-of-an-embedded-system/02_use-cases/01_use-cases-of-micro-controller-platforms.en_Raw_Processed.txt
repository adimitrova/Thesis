music 
hello, im good to see 
you back in course 
we start this video, 
let remind you 
covered in earlier videos 
now, you an idea 
an embedded processor is works 
you also familiar 
features an embedded processor 
i must remind you again, 
that in this course we make 
emphasis microcontrollers 
therefore, large field 
embedded processors 
is reduced to microcontrollers 
you learn microcontrollers, 
next step would to somehow 
put hands 
start actually working 
one way to so 
is to buy a microcontroller breadboard, 
set resistors, capacitors, wires, 
whatever else is necessary to build proper 
electrical circuits assemble 
circuits breadboard 
well, doesnt sound cool 
a long process 
you know there is always one resistor 
that you need that is missing, 
in end there will little motivation 
to continue playing microcontrollers 
luckily, there is another option 
to buy a ready made platform 
a mounted microcontroller 
to start working immediately 
in this video going 
to talk platforms 
lets start arduino 
arduino is a widely known platform 
fast prototyping 
platform uses atmel 
microcontrollers core 
overall there 
boards available 
website, you find 
organized according to application areas, 
internet things, 
wearable, others 
besides boards, there many 
shields built specifically 
arduino devices 
functionality 
shields vary a lot 
example, an mp shield you 
build mp player if you need one 
a wifi shield is a great 
tool to build applications 
lets say in domain 
internet things 
a joystick shield is suitable 
control purposes 
so if you want to extend 
functionality board 
application, 
you plug in a shield 
luckily easily done thanks 
to sockets installed in arduino 
arduino also provides integrated 
development environment software 
development, is easy to use 
really speeds development process 
second platform that i would like 
to mention is stm nucleo platform 
core there stx complex 
cortex m microcontrollers m to m 
so we choose here between speed 
energy consumption 
boards also extension connectors, 

connectors compatible 
arduino shields is convenient 
also there is socalled morpho 
connector kind shields 
a convenient feature this platform 
is that programmerdebugger 
is mounted board 
there in an online id available 
this platform well a whole set 
tools including operating system, 
tools, developer ecosystem 
building internet things solutions 
offline ides also available 
complex arduinos one, 

give you 
freedom to developer 
i would say that this platform is 
experienced users 
here i mentioned two kinds 
general purpose platforms 
that extended help 
shields to target specific areas 
there are, course, 
platforms available market 
target one specific area 
might extensible 
so there is a legit 
question you might 
i select a certain 
platform this diversity 
first all, choice obviously 
applicationoriented 
example, if you want to 
digital signal processing, 
you might want to use microcontroller 
that supports dsp operations 
if you need high computational power, 
cortex m 
cortex m microcontrollers would suit you 
well since highest clock 
frequency among previous 
mentioned mcus 
therefore choice would either 
arduino due stm nuclear cortex m m 
if small size is crucial you 
there is need high performance, 
you probably want 
to check arduino micro 
is also important to consider that 
platforms interchangeable in 
sense that application 
implemented two different platforms 
something i would like to emphasize 
is that a community is crucial 
comes to choosing a platform 
bigger community is, 
likely problems you might face 
already solved someone else, 
in case you 
probably find answer in internet 
i would like to show you a real 
project that implemented using 
microcontrollers 
is a metering system 
imagine that we a tube, there is 
liquid flowing that tube 
goal system is to 
measure liquids flow speed 
since we know size tube, 
we need to calculate volume 
liquid that time interval 
finally, we need to store 
measurements in a memory 
is more, device 
user interface, like a keyboard 
a small screen 
so, to start 
well, we start dividing 
tasks in two components, 
metering unit control unit 
next thing to would to decide 
to measure liquid flow speed 
this done using ultrasound 
we need to emit an ultrasonic sound, 
receive back, 
spectral analysis to 
estimate liquid flow speed 
dont worry if you dont understand 
a spectral analysis is 
here i want to show 
you is approach 
so we need to digital signal 
processing to get liquid flow speed 
we get measurements, 
we simple averaging, 
finally we store 
processed measurements 
okay, so we a set tasks, 
signal processing, averaging, 
storing, user interface 
would make sense to map set 
tasks onto two microcontrollers 
lets say signal processing 
will done mcu , 
we will call this part metering unit 
tasks will run control 
unit, will implemented mcu 
parts will connected 
together using a uart interface 
since mcu spectral analysis, 
cortex m microcontroller would suit well, 
since dsp extensions 
we will also need an adc to 
sample ultrasonic signal 
hand, mcu 
need to support dsp operations 
need to fast enough 
to communicate a screen 
a keyboard while 
averaging time 
enough pins to 
work a keyboard least 
two uart units to work screen 
to communicate metering unit 
cortex m would fit well 
is useful to leave room 
expansion 
this means you might want to 
extra functionality to device 
in future 
therefore, selected microcontrollers 
enough resources in 
terms performance memory 
finally, is important to notice 
that system implemented 
in many ways 
in this video we discussed 
ways to 
actually start working 
microcontrollers using platforms 
hopefully, you an idea 
to pick an appropriate platform 
application 
good luck 
sound
