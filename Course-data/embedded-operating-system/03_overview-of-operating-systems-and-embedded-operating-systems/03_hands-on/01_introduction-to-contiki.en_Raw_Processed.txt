hello, is good to see you back 
in previous videos, 
we explored several kernel architectures, 
monolithic, 
microkernel, modular 
now, going to focus an embedded 
operating system intended 
iot devices named contiki 
contiki is a good example 
a modular kernel, in this video, 
we will discuss 
important features 
contiki originally 
created adam dunkels 
in an open source 
embedded operating system 
contiki is designed networked 
memory constraint systems 
main focus is a low power 
wireless sensor systems 
internetofthings devices 
therefore, contiki always is 
lightweight enough to fulfill 
requirements an embedded device 
equipped a low end micro controller, 
small memory battery powered 
a good example this is 
contikis code foot print, 
needs kilobytes 
ram kilobytes rom 
currently there a lot companies 
universities involved in contikis 
development, 
texas instruments atmel, 
eta surik, oxford university, others 
this introduction, lets take a look 
important features contiki 
contiki uses protothreads, 
software flow control 
but, is a protothread 
now, suffices to say that 
protothreats is a mechanism 
that mixes an eventdriven model 
threats to provide sequential flow control 
without using complex state machines 
protothreats an extensive topic that 
we will cover in depth in another video 
we mentioned earlier, contiki is 
built embedded network systems 
therefore, provides powerful, 
low power internet communication stack 
that includes internet standards ipv 
ipv along recent 
low power wireless standards, 
lowpan, rpl coap 
in addition, 
due to limited power supply 
resource constraints in 
embedded network system, 
contiki provides mechanisms 
efficient memory allocation 
furthermore, contiki is based a modular 
kernel that supports dynamic loading 
linking 
a result, 
software modules loaded 
system requires 
particular functionality 
is an advantage 
system administrators 
users to know 
long a system running, 
systems working hours 
a particular power supply is used 
in order to address this issue, 
contiki provides a mechanism 
estimating systems power consumption 
contiki run in different types 
embedded networked drives, 
arm based devices 
hardware popular 
easy to buy low prices 
in addition, 
is possible to port contiki to 
new hardware a little effort 
we know, is easy to 
set a large wireless network 
requires a lot time 
effort to debug deploy devices 
to address this issue, contiki 
provides cooja network simulator 
cooja allows simulator large 
scale networks comprising 
nodes running fully 
emulated hardware devices 
using contikis examples is 
easiest way to implement simple 
complicated applications in a short time 
examples show to 
develop application code, 
while others demonstrate system features 
in addition, there is a common line shell, 
suitable debugging operations 
shell commands combined in 
powerful ways using unix style pipelines 
is also possible an application 
to define shell commands that 
work together existing ones 
there interesting 
features contiki 
that possible 
to cover in lessons 
therefore we strongly encourage you 
to read recommended materials 
ending this video, 
i would like to show you 
to implement classic 
hello world example in contiki 
if you run this code, 
phrase hello world, 
will printed to 
terminal device 
to get details 
to write a program 
drawn an application in contiki 
you come back to lectures 
detail use 
thank you watching 
see in next videos
