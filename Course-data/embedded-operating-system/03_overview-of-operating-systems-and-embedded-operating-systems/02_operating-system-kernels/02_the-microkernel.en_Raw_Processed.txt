welcome 
is good to see you back 
this lesson 
in previous videos, we explored 
a monolithic kernel main features 
now, we will move another 
kind kernel, microkernel 
in this video, we will cover 
definition microkernel, 
compares to monolithic kernel, 
advantages disadvantages 
lets begin 
interesting questions 
is microkernel, 
is main difference between 
a monolithic kernel microkernel 
answering questions, 
lets go back briefly to 
lesson monolithic linux kernel 
in a monolithic kernel, important 
functions services operating 
system, file system device 
drivers, executed in kernel mode 
a result, kernel is large 
millions lines code inside 
in contrast, in a microkernel, 
almost functions 
services removed kernel 
mode relocated user mode 
a result, kernel size is minimal 
this point, there may 
a question raising in mind 
is main function kernel, 

if almost 
functions removed 
comparing a microkernel based 
system a conventional one, 
main difference is that 
operating systems code 
runs a separate process, 
mostly outside kernel 
then, tasks left 
kernel interrupt handling, 
lowlevel process management 
message passing handling 
now, lets talk interprocess 
communication in microkernels 
a common communication method in 
microkernels is message passing 
to better understand it, 
we must address three issues 
is interprocess communication 
is a message, 
message passing work 
interprocess communication, ipc 
short, refers to mechanism that 
an operating system provides 
exchanging information among 
processes a message is simply 
data that is transferred 
one process to another using ipc 
in a microkernel, messages 
passed using message registers 
this is a sending process, 
writes a message to register 
receiving process, 
receiving process read data 
sometimes data to sent 
larger receivers register, 
in case, 
message contains a reference 
to a shared memory region 
data is stored 
ipc is synchronous, 
meaning that a message is 
sent one process to another, 
processes must call 
corresponding ipc operation 
a sender will log until either 
receiver performed ipc call, 
a specified time 
interval lapsed 
is important to mention that ipc 
use intermediate buffers 
therefore, improving efficiency 
reducing complexity operation 
lets move to advantages 
microkernels 
one main advantages 
a microkernel is that code is minimal 
is often case that 
less code is written, 
less probability 
that an error occur 
benefits, due to a minimal kernel 
small trusted computing base 
suitability verification 
trusted computing base 
is related to security 
in computer security terminology, 
trusted computing base is set 
hardware, software 
procedural components that 
enforce security policy 
this means that in order 
to break security, 
an attacker must subvert one 

regarding verification, benefit 
a small quote size is obvious 
less code we have, 
simpler is verifying 
finally, due to modularity 
microkernel, 
is easy to add software to system, 
thus making scalable extensible 
we already talked 
advantages microkernels, 
drawbacks 
didnt microkernel 
actually win race 
although seemed to 
a better idea in 
to answer this question, lets go 
a simple example like creating a file 
in order to create a file 
in a monolithic kernel, 
is necessary to perform 
a context to switch two times 
first one occurs system 
switches application 
to kernel, so 
file operation executed 
second one occurs kernel 
gives control back to calling process 
now, in case a microkernel, 
expensive is file operation 
in terms context switching 
well, turns takes a lot 
context switching between kernel 
user process 
reason 
this is that is necessary to 
switch among multiple processors 
one controlling a small function 
in this particular example, one process 
may in charge file system 
while another handles device driver 
a result, overall system 
response becomes slower 
this overhead is limited 
to inputoutput operations 
kernel services, interprocess 
communication, also affected 
in this video, well describe 
important features microkernels 
however, to get a deeper 
understanding details,

thanks watching, 
see you in coming videos
