hello 
is good to see you back 
this lesson 
in previous videos we explored, 
a birds eye view, 
operating systems 
execute tasks 
we will take a look 
linux kernel 
to discuss characteristics 
end lesson you 
understand main linux kernel functions 
advantages 
lets begin questions 
is a linux process 
a process operate 
many processes there 
in order to deal questions, 
we first define linux processes 
a process is one fundamental 
abstractions in linux 
in short considered 
a program in execution 
a process encompasses a set 
resources processor state, 
address space, threats data section 
linux kernel implements a process 
manager to keep track process 
so using processes 
scriptors store information 
run state process, 
address space, 
list open files, process priority, etc 
a process in one 
four possible states 
a running state means process is 
already running is ready to run 
waiting state is used 
processes waiting an event 
a particular resource 
there two types waiting, 
including interruptible waiting 
uninterruptible waiting 
a process is in a stopped state 
eligible running anymore 
often, a result 
receiving a system signal 
however, in cases a process 
that is debugged 
in stopped state 
finally, a zombie state 
is a process occurs 
process is terminated 
kernel removed resources yet 
next we will focus memory 
management in linux kernel 
actually memory management system in 
kernel is a virtual memory system 
this means that memory 
addresses seen user processes 
physical addresses 
used hardware 
to give you a better idea 
memory management in linux, 
i will discuss main features 
first is large address spaces 
this means kernel allows running 
programs to allocate virtual memory 
systems physical memory 
kernel also provides 
memory protection 
this way every process 
virtual addressed space 
virtual addresses spaces completely 
separated unless a result 
process running concurrently 
effect one another 
next is memory mapping, is used 
mapping image data files 
to a process addresses space 
this way, 
content a file is directly linked 
to a process virtual addresses space 
linux also a mechanism 
fair physical memory allocation 
ensures that running 
processes receive a fair share 
systems physical memory 
last least, 
there is a shared virtual memory 
mentioned before, process 
a separate virtual address space 
however, in cases, 
a shared virtual memory is necessary 
lets take a look an example 
many processors run, 
a vas come in shell instead 
replicating many copies vas 
is better to one 
copy in physical memory 
processes share 
now, lets talk 
scheduling in linux kernel 
scheduling is important, 
since defines policy 
a process run 
this is process runs first 
one runs later 
linux scheduler is 
a priority scheduler 
meaning, policy is based 
priority processes 
every time scheduler runs, 
priority processes 
in wrong cue is analyzed 
process highest 
priority is allowed to run next 
in systems many processors, 
processor a separate run queue 
processor selects 
processes queue 
however, there may case that 
a processor along waiting queue 
compared to processors 
in this case linux scheduler will 
move processors long queue 
to shorter queues 
getting a balanced 
workload a result 
in previous videos we define an interrupt 
an event generated a hardware 
component that causes change in 
sequence executed instructions 
interrupts classified in 
two categories, synchronous 
asynchronous interrupts 
synchronous interrupts produced 
cpu control unit 
while executing instructions 
called synchronous 
control unit 
issues terminating 
execution an instruction 
hand, 
asynchronous interrupts generated 
hardware devices arbitrary 
times regarding cpu clock signals 
linux kernel handles interrupt 
signals using interrupt handlers, 
also called interrupt service routines 
main difference between 
interrupt handlers 
functions in kernel 
is that an interrupt handler 
is executed in a special context 
named interrupt context 
to finalize todays talk, i will list 
advantages linux kernel 
linux kernel is open source 
anyone contribute to code base 
individuals organizations alike 
a result this 
there is a large community that provides 
support produced large quantities 
documentation, 
freely available in internet 
linux kernel easily customized 
therefore, there is wide variety 
computer architectures 
you use 
small sized microcontrollers to 
full fledged minicore processors 
linux kernel is a 
complex piece software 
unfortunately, many details 
covered in this video 
due to lack time 
functions inputoutput 
device management 
interprocess communication 
security protection 
management describe here 
however, to get a comprehensive view 
them, i recommend you to read 
linux kernel development book 
third edition written robert love 
thanks watching 
see you in coming lectures
