music 
hello, is good to see you back 
this lesson 
previously, we explored 
an eagles eye linux kernel is 
is important 
now, we will look 
another type kernel 
to discover detailed 
characteristics advantages 
end lesson, you 
understand differences between 
three types kernel 
features 
a result, you will able to 
utilize a specific kernel type 
a particular application requirements 
lets begin describing 
modular kernel is 
a modular kernel a sort hybrid 
between a monolithic kernel 
a microkernel 
aims to get best features 
types architectures 
so in concrete, 
a modular kernel perform tasks good 
a monolithic kernel while stability 
is similar a microkernel 
a result, we obtain a kernel 
efficient memory utilization 
good overall performance time 
a modular kernel comprises 
a multitude modules, 
one dedicated to 
a specific system task 
a key feature systems 
is that modules loaded 
functionality is needed 
example, 
a particular device driver is loaded 
if there is a process that 
needs access to that device 
loading a module 
take a large amount time 
however, this strategy could 
generate a severe overhead 
if multiple modules constantly 
loaded unloaded 
system would spent 
time managing modules 
instead executing actual work, 
thus yielding poor performance 
to address this issue, 
a module is loaded will remain in 
kernel until is explicitly removed 
in cases, a module is required 
one particular process 
however, is possible that several 
processes require module 
in case, 
colonel creates multiple copies 
main reason 
this is to prevent overhead 
cost constantly loading 
unloading modules 
in kernel architectures 
new functionality is added, 
kernel must revealed 
however, this is case 
modular kernels, 
new models easily added 
without recompiling thus saving time 
filing fixing bugs in a monolithic 
kernel is a hard task 
is time consuming 
demands a lot effort 
example, a bug in a device 
driver is bound to kernel 
may prevent system booting 
in this situation, is hard to say 
part kernel is causing problem 
this situation easily avoided 
a device driver is a loadable module 
since kernel must boot 
loading module 
in case system 
perform correctly kernel 
is successfully booted, 
simple to find fault module 
we discussed before, kernel 
loads modules necessary 
therefore, systems memory 
efficiently managed 
due to advantages 
modular kernels, 
we conclude that 
modular kernel, 
overall system performance increases 
kernel size is large 
although a modular system provides 
a multitude advantages, 
still drawbacks 
mentioned before, modular kernel 
inherits stability microkernel 
however, this stability cannot 
warranted in cases fragmentation 
another disadvantage is that 
security may vulnerable many 
interspaces passed 
finally, is easy to 
maintain a large number modules 
created 
several third parties 
this is end lesson today 
hopefully now, you a better 
idea a modular kernel is, 
makes different 
kernels advantages 
in next video, we will discuss 
a modular kernel is implemented 
thank you watching see you
