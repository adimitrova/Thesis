hello, welcome back to course 
in this video, we going to 
talk wired communication 
we will also cover adcs dacs 
since units convert analogue 
values that fundamental in 
world to a digital form 
vice versa 
lets start wired communication 
definition is quite simple 
you might guess, 
wired communication is 
transmission data wires 
wirebased communication 
communication, regardless 
whether is wired 
wireless, is guided certain rules 
set rules is called 
a communication protocol 
two devices communicate 
if use protocol 
analogy that you think is two 
people try to talk to 
successfully understand 
if use language 
there many communication protocols 
parallel, 
enables high data rate communication 
serial like usb 
is resource efficient 
if we think number 
physical connections needed 
to enable communication 
embedded systems we deal 
resource constrained devices, 
communication is mostly 
done via serial protocols 
usb, spi, uart, others 
apart serialparallel 
type classification, 
communication protocols 
synchronous asynchronous 
synchronous communication protocols 
utilize common clock between 
receiver transmitter 
upside is higher throughput since 
synchronization data is needed 
asynchronous protocols 
use a common clock 
instead, synchronization 
between receiver 
transmitter is done 
using synchronization data 
example, start stop bits in rs 
protocol synchronization purposes 
a good analogy might 
two speaking people 
listener starts listening attentively 
speaker starts speaking 
in this case, first two words 
speaker synchronization 
make listener start 
receiving verbal information 
upside asynchronous communication 
protocols is that there is need 
an additional wire a common clock 
however, communication 
protocols slower 
part transmitted 
data is used synchronization 
full duplex, half duplex 
you might come across words 
if you read communication 
protocols 
mean 
full duplex communication is 
a bidirectional communication 
that operate in 
ways time 
a mobile phone is an example 
full duplex communication 
you interlocutor 
speak time 
you may understand anything 
still you will hear partner 
partner will hear you 
however, half duplex communication 
allows one side to talk 
is either you partner 
a good example type 
communications walkietalkies 
instance, usb versions 
half duplex prodigals, 
whereas usb two 
additional pairs wires 
this enables full 
duplex data transfers 
that we mentioned usb, lets give 
details this communication protocol 
usb stands universal serial bus 
in beginning, 
usb using four wires 
protocol evolved, 
additional wires added 
example, usb , 
apart mentioned four wires, 
uses two additional twisted pairs 
mentioned before, 
additional wires introduce 
full duplex capabilities to usb 
data rates also vary 
quite significantly if we 
compare initial versions 
protocol 
later ones, 
mbits to gbits 
structure a usb 
network is a tire star 
consists one usb devices 
one hubs host controller 
one host exists in network 
hubs nodes to 
devices hubs connect to 
host polls hubs 
changes in network 
thus, if a new device 
appears in network, 
if device is unplugged, 
hubs will notify host that 
devices that use usb 
grouped several categories 
category represents functionality 
that device provide to host 
so is a structure 
protocol 
data is sent using transfers 
transfers consist packets 
there four main types 
transfers in usb protocol, control, 
bulk, isochronous, 
an interrupt transfer 
packet consists bytes, 
byte serves a certain purpose 
example, sync byte is used 
synchronization 
pid byte contains packet id 
packets also 
different types, 
token, data, handshaking, a descriptor 
spi is another communication protocol 
widely used in embedded systems 
spi stands 
serial peripheral interface 
uses four wires operation 
protocol operate one 
master one several slaves 
data is shifted bit bit 
master to slave 
well slave to master 
shift registers connected 
a circle in a way that 
a bit is shifted in a slave register, 
a bit 
end register is shifted 
shifted masters register 
there is also a possibility to connect 
slave devices in a daisy chain manner 
in this case, shift register of, 
lets say, slave , 
will connected 
shift register slave 
in order to make a processing element 
deal outer physical world, 
physical values represent, 
example, amount light 
pressure, temperature, 
voltage converted to numbers 
way around, 
a possibility to convert a number 
a physical value, 
lets say a voltage level 
luckily there special kinds 
converters solve this problem 
analog to digital converters 
digital to analog converters 
main objective is to convert 
voltage levels to a number, 
back a number to a voltage level 
among large variety parameters 
describe units, 
lets emphasize 
resolution is minimal deviation 
voltage that detected an adc 
or, if we reformulate definition 
a dac, resolution dac 
is minimal difference 
an input number that yet 
leads to a different voltage level 
resolution is quantity 
digits in a number 
is result 
a conversion an adc 
initial value a conversion 
a dac 
thus, if we bit resolution, adc, 
that means that result 
take possible values 
parameters conversion 
rate defines number 
conversions that adc 
dac make in one second 
conversion time specifies 
time needed a single conversion 
conversion actually happen 
there several methods 
one i will elaborate on, 
is successive approximation 
an adc exploits this 
method a dac inside 
works using binary search 
initially, we apply an input 
voltage level to adc 
we set significant 
bit resulting number to 
this number is converted 
dac to voltage 
if obtained voltage is 
higher input voltage, 
significant bit stays , 
else set to 
we shift to next bit, set 
to , convert number to a voltage, 
compare resulting 
voltage to input voltage 
if resulting voltage is 
higher input voltage, 
bit remains 
otherwise, resets to 
thus, we go bit 
until we obtain final number 
dac, one methods is 
called pulsewidth modulator 
input number defines 
a duty cycleperiod 
ratio generated pulse signal 
generated signal is fed 
to a lowpass filter, 
output, 
we a constant voltage level 
adcs dacs either 
part bigger divisors, 
example, microcontrollers, 
work a stand alone unit 
particles, we also explain 
analog to digital conversion 
digital to analog conversion work 
thanks watching, 
ill see you in next video
