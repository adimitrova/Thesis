Hello and welcome to this course on
embedded hardware and operating systems.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,670
My name is Marco Ramirez and
I will be your lecturer during the course.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,181
Welcome to the University of Turku.

5
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,227
Well, let's get started.

8
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:51,699
Cyber physical systems operate at the edge
between the cyber and the real world and

9
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:57,200
compromise of computational networking and
physical components.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,490
The importance of such systems
is difficult to overestimate.

11
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,830
They are literally everywhere from
the smartphone to space station.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,660
Hardware is an integral component
of a cyber physical system.

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,070
This is figuratively speaking,
a foundation of the system.

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,090
Therefore, it is important to
choose the hardware correctly.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,200
This choice should be system oriented.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,740
Meaning that the hardware should
fulfill the requirements of the cyber

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,520
physical system.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,180
At the same time, the resources
provided by the chosen hardware

19
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,060
should not be excessive for the system.

20
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:40,960
Unlike hardware design for
a specific purpose,

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,270
embedded systems require software to
function and accomplish their work goal.

22
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,570
However, writing this software
from the ground up for

23
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,970
every type of hardware is not practical.

24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,350
The most common approach
is to use operating systems

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,265
to handle the basic task of
managing the hardware resources and

26
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:02,695
provide great services for
user applications.

27
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,995
In this course, we will talk
about two components of a cyber

28
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:12,083
physical system namely,
hardware and operating systems.

29
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:16,239
We will give you hints on how to make
a proper choice of those components.

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,070
I hope this knowledge will boost your
interest in cyber physical systems and

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,868
help you to implement
your ideas more quickly.

32
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,555
Good luck.
