2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:09,050
Hello and welcome to the first
lecture of the course.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,250
This course if called embedded
hardware and operating systems.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,830
This course is a practice oriented guide
on how to build an embedded system.

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,970
Nowadays, computers
are literally everywhere.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,890
They run engines, they encode voice, and
construct radio signals to use them for

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,570
mobile communication.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,960
They even control your microwave.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,830
This non-visible computers that make it
all possible are called embedded systems.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,080
Although embedded system have received
much attention from researcher

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,720
in the past,
the community has just recently recognized

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,990
that new approaches are needed
to develop and analyze them.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,900
Mainly because they are one
of the most rapidly growing

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,480
fields in the computer industry.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,650
Considering the transient technology,

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,080
we can say that such kind of systems will
soon be integrated into more things.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,230
Computer will be everywhere information
will be available anytime, any where.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,110
As an example of embedded systems,
we can think of airplanes.

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,700
An airplane is full of
embedded computers in it.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,500
Seats have entertainment systems with
video, audio and gaming capabilities.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,780
There is an air conditioning system
adjusting the temperature and

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,770
pressure of the cabin.

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,960
On the other hand,

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,770
the flight management system is heavily
equipped with embedded systems.

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,210
There are plenty of different sensors
reporting the situation to the pilot.

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,930
Location, weather, altitude,

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,170
speed, orientation,
all these values are constantly monitored.

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,880
The autopilot system significantly
reduces the pilot workload.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,050
Wings, jet engines,
landing gear, brakes, and so

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,700
on are controlled electronically
from the cockpit.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,100
So as we see,
an airplane is full of computers

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,120
embedded in different locations
with different functionalities and

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,730
purposes and
with different requirements too.

34
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,970
What are the main characteristics and

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,860
constraints of an embedded
system used in airplanes?

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,900
Well first and the most important one,
they have to be reliable.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,020
Sensors should report
correct values all the time.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,930
The control system should not make any
mistake under any circumstances and

39
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,310
must react according to deadlines.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,650
Wings, brakes, landing gear, and so

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,039
on should follow exactly
what the pilot demands.

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,680
If any of these reliability
requirements are not fulfilled,

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,730
then a catastrophe can easily happen.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,670
What do we mean by reliability,
and how to measure it?

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,290
Anyway, we will discuss
it in future lessons.

46
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,270
On the other hand,
embedded systems should be secure.

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,380
No one must be able to break
in to the control system or

48
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,990
the airplane and
override the sensors and command data.

49
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,060
What else can we think of?

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,330
Well another important concern is the real
time behavior of the airplane's systems

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,100
both in the passenger cabins and
in the cockpit.

52
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,760
Passenger expects to watch smooth
movies with no interruption or jitter.

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,210
The pilots commands should take
effect at the right time, and

54
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,070
the autopilot system must
not make late decisions.

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,370
Another good example that reflects
the idea that computing will be everywhere

56
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,400
is the Internet of Things.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,720
Indeed, the aim is to spread
nodes around the world.

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,330
A node, it's the small embedded system
connected to sensors and activators.

59
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,160
Nodes will collect data of any kind.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,380
It may be temperature measurements or
acceleration.

61
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,390
The data then will be pre-processed in
the fog layer an sent to the Cloud.

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,620
There are many problems
to tackle in this field.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,950
Nodes may be located in remote areas, and

64
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,140
it is desirable to make the nodes work for
longer.

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,560
So energy efficiency is one of the issues
that the Internet of Things pulls out.

66
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,880
Another issue is making
the gathered data meaningful.

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,600
In other words, it is about getting
information out from the messy data.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,890
Here machine learning is
coming into the picture.

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,850
So Internet of Things will provide people
with a lot of data, which can be used, for

70
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,920
example, to optimize processes.

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,490
There are many other examples of
embedded systems that are applied

72
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,610
in different fields of industry,
from home appliances to aerospace.

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,140
Now that you probably have a basic
idea of what an embedded system is,

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,490
let's talk about how we
can describe such system.

75
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,770
Well an embedded system
is typically reactive.

76
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,310
This means that such system is constantly
interacting with its environment and

77
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,910
executes with that environment say so.

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Reactive systems being in some
state is waiting for an input,

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,330
performs computations, produces an output,
and transits to a new state.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,190
Thus such systems can
be modeled as Automata.

81
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,450
In other words, it is a set of states,
inputs, and outputs.

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,680
So the abstract model of an embedded
system consists of inputs,

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,090
outputs, a unit to perform computations,
and

84
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,180
communication interfaces to exchange
data with other embedded systems.

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,890
Inputs provide the computation
unit with data.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,380
Sensors can play the role of inputs.

87
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,790
Sensors can convert physical
quantities into numbers.

88
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,710
Actuators for example,
electrical moderators can be outputs.

89
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,730
In between inputs and outputs there
is a unit called processing element

90
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,700
that makes computations on the input and
produces output.

91
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,380
A persisting element
is the digital device.

92
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,930
During the course, we will talk about
two types of processing elements and

93
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,050
better processors and FPGA's.

94
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,470
In the course, we will talk about
what a processing element is, and

95
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,000
how to pick an appropriate one for
certain applications.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,780
We will discuss how embedded
processors and FPGA's are built, and

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,700
how to deal with them.

98
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,500
We also will cover most popular embedded
platforms, this will be of great interest

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,470
for those who want to get hands on
experience on building an embedded system.

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,612
We will also talk about sensors and
actuators, and how to interface with them.

101
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,550
Embedded hardware works
guided by software.

102
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,510
That's why embedded operating systems
will also be covered in the course.

103
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,650
Indeed, the right choice of embedded
operating system may not only

104
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,590
simplify the development, but also
affect crucial parameters of the system,

105
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,080
such as energy consumption,
or computational performance.

106
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,300
This course is intended for

107
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,095
those who want to obtain knowledge
on how to build an embedded system.

108
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:17,570
This is,
selecting the appropriate components,

109
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,129
based on the requirements you have for
your application.

110
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,880
To ease the process of selection,
it maybe important

111
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,880
to know how those components work and
what their main characteristics are.

112
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,600
After selecting those components,
they are assembled together,

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,160
program may have needed and used.

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,280
All these steps from selection to assembly
are going to be covered during the course.

115
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,315
So if you want to design
your own embedded system,

116
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:50,074
this course is a good starting point for
that.
