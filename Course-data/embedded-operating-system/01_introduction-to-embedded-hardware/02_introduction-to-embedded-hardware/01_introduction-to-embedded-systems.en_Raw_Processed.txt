hello welcome to first 
lecture course 
this course if called embedded 
hardware operating systems 
this course is a practice oriented guide 
to build an embedded system 
nowadays, computers 
literally everywhere 
run engines, encode voice, 
construct radio signals to use 
mobile communication 
even control microwave 
this nonvisible computers that make 
possible called embedded systems 
although embedded system received 
much attention researcher 
in past, 
community recently recognized 
that new approaches needed 
to develop analyze 
mainly one 
rapidly growing 
fields in computer industry 
considering transient technology, 
we say that kind systems will 
soon integrated things 
computer will everywhere information 
will available anytime, 
an example embedded systems, 
we think airplanes 
an airplane is full 
embedded computers in 
seats entertainment systems 
video, audio gaming capabilities 
there is an air conditioning system 
adjusting temperature 
pressure cabin 
hand, 
flight management system is heavily 
equipped embedded systems 
there plenty different sensors 
reporting situation to pilot 
location, weather, altitude, 
speed, orientation, 
values constantly monitored 
autopilot system significantly 
reduces pilot workload 
wings, jet engines, 
landing gear, brakes, so 
controlled electronically 
cockpit 
so we see, 
an airplane is full computers 
embedded in different locations 
different functionalities 
purposes 
different requirements 
main characteristics 
constraints an embedded 
system used in airplanes 
well first important one, 
to reliable 
sensors report 
correct values time 
control system make 
mistake circumstances 
must react according to deadlines 
wings, brakes, landing gear, so 
follow exactly 
pilot demands 
if reliability 
requirements fulfilled, 
a catastrophe easily happen 
we mean reliability, 
to measure 
anyway, we will discuss 
in future lessons 
hand, 
embedded systems secure 
one must able to break 
in to control system 
airplane 
override sensors command data 
else we think 
well another important concern is real 
time behavior airplanes systems 
in passenger cabins 
in cockpit 
passenger expects to watch smooth 
movies interruption jitter 
pilots commands take 
effect right time, 
autopilot system must 
make late decisions 
another good example that reflects 
idea that computing will everywhere 
is internet things 
indeed, aim is to spread 
nodes around world 
a node, small embedded system 
connected to sensors activators 
nodes will collect data kind 
may temperature measurements 
acceleration 
data will preprocessed in 
fog layer an sent to cloud 
there many problems 
to tackle in this field 
nodes may located in remote areas, 
is desirable to make nodes work 
longer 
so energy efficiency is one issues 
that internet things pulls 
another issue is making 
gathered data meaningful 
in words, is getting 
information messy data 
here machine learning is 
coming picture 
so internet things will provide people 
a lot data, used, 
example, to optimize processes 
there many examples 
embedded systems that applied 
in different fields industry, 
home appliances to aerospace 
that you probably a basic 
idea an embedded system is, 
lets talk we 
describe system 
well an embedded system 
is typically reactive 
this means that system is constantly 
interacting environment 
executes that environment say so 
reactive systems in 
state is waiting an input, 
performs computations, produces an output, 
transits to a new state 
thus systems 
modeled automata 
in words, is a set states, 
inputs, outputs 
so abstract model an embedded 
system consists inputs, 
outputs, a unit to perform computations, 

communication interfaces to exchange 
data embedded systems 
inputs provide computation 
unit data 
sensors play role inputs 
sensors convert physical 
quantities numbers 
actuators example, 
electrical moderators outputs 
in between inputs outputs there 
is a unit called processing element 
that makes computations input 
produces output 
a persisting element 
is digital device 
course, we will talk 
two types processing elements 
better processors fpgas 
in course, we will talk 
a processing element is, 
to pick an appropriate one 
certain applications 
we will discuss embedded 
processors fpgas built, 
to deal 
we also will cover popular embedded 
platforms, this will great interest 
want to get hands 
experience building an embedded system 
we will also talk sensors 
actuators, to interface 
embedded hardware works 
guided software 
thats embedded operating systems 
will also covered in course 
indeed, right choice embedded 
operating system may 
simplify development, also 
affect crucial parameters system, 
energy consumption, 
computational performance 
this course is intended 
want to obtain knowledge 
to build an embedded system 
this is, 
selecting appropriate components, 
based requirements you 
application 
to ease process selection, 
maybe important 
to know components work 
main characteristics 
selecting components, 
assembled together, 
program may needed used 
steps selection to assembly 
going to covered course 
so if you want to design 
embedded system, 
this course is a good starting point 
that
