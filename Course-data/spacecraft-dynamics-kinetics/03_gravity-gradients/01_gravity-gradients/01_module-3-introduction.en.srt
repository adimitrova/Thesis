Hi and welcome to the third
segment of Spacecraft Kinetics.

2
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,177
Here, we're going to be studying in
detail the gravity gradient, torque and

3
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:15,318
forces that happen on a rigid spacecraft.

4
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:19,443
So with the spacecraft, every part of the
mass distribution is a different distance

5
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:21,140
away from the center of the Earth.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,032
That means it's experiencing
a different gravitational force.

7
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,353
Now, we have to sum it
up over a whole body.

8
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:31,014
So in particular of interest to us is if
you have the gravity gradient that you've

9
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:35,756
computed, which orientations of a craft
caused the gravity gradient to be zero.

10
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:39,822
And when we're moving in a rotating frame,
which one of these are now relative

11
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,349
equilibrious will be
developing all of those and

12
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,647
then there's some interesting examples.

13
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,376
You can look at which
one of those is stable.

14
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,098
Look at a tall slender object,

15
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:52,354
the lower object weighs more has a
stronger gravity force than the top part.

16
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,442
So if you disturb the attitude,
this would help stabilize it.

17
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,274
We'll begin to study such
configuration for full 3D.

18
00:00:58,274 --> 00:00:59,688
This is a very useful topic.

19
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:02,088
There's many satellites of
gravity being stabilized or

20
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,988
there are big things
like the space station.

21
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:06,715
Gravity gradients definitely
impact the attitude motion.

22
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:10,803
So, this section gives you a good
handle on how to predict that torque.
