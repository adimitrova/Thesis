1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,925
Now we have ways to get the torque to be zero either the shape can make it go to zero

2
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:17,719
or for any shape particular orientations if we locked up one of our principal axis and,

3
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,690
you know, be, make it equal with the position vector.

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,390
So what we've just identified is if you look at this equation,

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,179
if you have a circular orbit at 7,000 kilometers

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:34,064
or a circular orbit at 42,000 kilometers Leo versus Geo, you're

7
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:38,195
going to get different gravity gradient torques. Kind of makes sense, right?

8
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:40,250
The further out you go the weaker gravity gets,

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,109
that we could effect the gravity gradients becomes as well.

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,304
So as you change your orbits,

11
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:49,780
it actually affects your attitude, because you get different torques acting on it.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,575
So is the inverse true?

13
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:55,005
That's what we want to study here.

14
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,384
So if you take your spacecraft and it's pointing at the sun

15
00:00:57,384 --> 00:01:01,899
and you decide to rotate it with reaction wheels and point now at the Earth,

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:07,060
you've taken all this finite mass and moved this distribution around.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,299
Since orbits affect attitude, do attitudes affect orbits?

18
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,187
If they have different orientations, do I change my orbit type? No?

19
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,799
The answer is yes.

20
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,060
You do.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,539
The more important question is do you care?

22
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,185
How big is that term?

23
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,180
So we're going to step through this math a little bit quicker

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,584
than what I did with the other stuff, but it's the same kind of principles,

25
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:35,170
but you'll see it would have to go to second order expansions that are set up first

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,775
because the first order expansions actually vanish

27
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,599
and then you get this expression and I'm going to rewrite it.

28
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,687
So now, you get the gravity force much more precisely assuming

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,069
it's not just a point mass, but it's a finite shape.

30
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,180
And now, orientation couples into it.

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,400
Where is your mass?

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,129
Do you have more mass lined up close to the Earth versus all the mass lined, you know,

33
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,219
lined up evenly away from the earth?

34
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,445
That means different gravitational accelerations.

35
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:00,620
You can have different orbits out of it.

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,444
So let's go through the same math again.

37
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:05,484
It's the same blob, the same force,

38
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:08,724
but instead of doing a body integral of R across the four step,

39
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:13,469
which gave us torques about center of mass we just want the net force acting on this body.

40
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,479
So we just treat the body in a roll of all the little D.N. forces

41
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,594
that we're going to have.

42
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,360
So we just dropped R cross parts.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,580
So several terms you'll see will be very similar.

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,599
That's why I'm kind of going through this quicker.

45
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,840
Now we have to do in the end, you plug in the stuff like before.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,819
It's very, very similar.

47
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,180
Just you don't have that R cross term and then we have to do an expansion

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,874
of one over R cubed, because that's RC plus little R,

49
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,509
but I'm keeping the first order term, which we had before.

50
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,520
These two's would cancel, in that case.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,919
But there's also a second order term here and here,

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,754
those end up being critical because, again, first order vanishes.

53
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,940
You plug this in, manipulate.

54
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,620
Similar arguments as before, we can see these body integrals here,

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,699
center of mass makes that vanish, center of mass will make this vanish.

56
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,724
Then we have other terms.

57
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:05,757
This is one we just expanded earlier with vector cross-product identities.

58
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:09,849
That ended up being the inertia tensor plus something.

59
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,569
Relative, parallel to RC which cancel because we cross with RC,

60
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,274
but here we're not crossing with stuff so it's going to be a little bit different

61
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:20,219
and that's going to be total mass.

62
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:22,930
This just screams for more vector identities just because,

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,539
and that's just going to be the R squared.

64
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,384
It will give us a polar moment of inertia of the stuff.

65
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:32,854
So we apply, again, the same identity we used earlier, plug this stuff in, right.

66
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:37,840
It's the same process and you start to identify, ah, look this with the minus sign

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,664
that becomes the inertia tensor.

68
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:42,224
This too, we can relate to inertia tensors

69
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:47,623
and these R squares bodying with R squares are actually polar moments of inertia

70
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,539
and that's defined here.

71
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,889
And this is something I'm just giving you.

72
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,340
You can look this up into a classic statics mechanics book,

73
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,224
but the polar moment is the same thing as one half of the trace of the stuff.

74
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:00,069
You can actually prove this to yourself pretty quickly.

75
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,899
If you look at the I matrix, the diagonals are all X square plus Y square.

76
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:07,610
Y square plus Z square and X square plus Z square.

77
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,620
You start adding them up.

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,801
You basically get two times X square Y square C square

79
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,204
and X square Y square, C square, is always little R squared.

80
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:17,599
So that's where you've just proven it, right?

81
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,985
That's the same thing.

82
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:22,139
So I can go from the inertia tensor, get the trace and do that half.

83
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,269
I'm also going to start factoring out more RC's here.

84
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,850
If I divide both by RC magnitude, I get just these unit direction vectors.

85
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,204
It will be a nice convenient form,

86
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:36,500
but I have to factor out an extra RC squared over there.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,529
So it's the same math steps.

88
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,579
It's just a lot of extra details and let's see what we get.

89
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,300
We use inertia tensor definition

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,095
and in the end this is your more precise gravity force for an orbit.

91
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:50,240
All right.

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,810
Where if you look at this, and this is,

93
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,415
in orbits class you tend to deal with gravity accelerations.

94
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:58,394
R dot is equal to minus as you ever are cube times R.

95
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,699
That was the classic orbit equation here

96
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,870
and getting it to in terms of force everything is multiplied times M

97
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,629
but it's basically the same.

98
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:11,470
And so you got minus MU over RC cubed times RC, right, for that one here.

99
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,269
That's the point mass approximation.

100
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,009
That's what 50\50 was all about, that orbits class.

101
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,839
Then, first order terms dropped

102
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,670
and all we have left afterwards are all the second order terms,

103
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,584
which every one of them we're able to write somehow is a function of the inertia tensor,

104
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:29,769
which is kind of cool and I factor things out.

105
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:35,410
So, have this unit direction vectors and had extra RC squares that I had to factor out.

106
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,522
So now, this is the formulation.

107
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,839
So you can see, as you change your attitude,

108
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,464
all of a sudden you will have different results and you have a small impact on your orbit.

109
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,144
So if you fly, flying this way and then you go this way,

110
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,720
you will have a slightly different orbit.

111
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,269
But for Earth, man-made spacecraft on Earth.

112
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:58,240
This is a really, really small effect.

113
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,930
If you start flying around small asteroids and boulders, this may not be a small effect.

114
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,375
Right?

115
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,930
And this is stuff you have to actually account for when you do these extra expansions.

116
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,264
The classic point mass model is not going to work necessarily.

117
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,470
So in this class we're not doing asteroids,

118
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,334
so we're going to look at this now quickly and do some dimensional analysis.

119
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:22,530
Inertia's are all mass of the spacecraft times distance squared for every element.

120
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,980
Kind of the large, good opera estimate just make it a sphere.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,404
Then all the radii, all the mass, is as far out as you can do it.

122
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:31,725
We don't build spacecraft that way, but that would be kind of an upper bound.

123
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,370
So it's mass times the radius of the spacecraft squared divided

124
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,139
by mass times the radius of the orbit squared, the masses cancel.

125
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,160
So only need to look at the ratios of spacecraft squared to radius of orbit squared.

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,579
Orbits, let's make Leo easy 7,000 kilometers squared at 7 million kilometers that's 10,

127
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,285
49 times 10 to the 12.

128
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:56,454
So it's about 10 to the 13-ish order of meters.

129
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,509
Man-made objects.

130
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,220
Around one-ish average radius.

131
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,040
If look at the mass distribution and everything.

132
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:12,269
So this term is one, plus something, one over 10 to the 13.

133
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,149
That's pretty small.

134
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,689
You're going to have to account for, you know, Lawrence forces, drag forces,

135
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,904
origin pressure forces, out gassing forces probably of the material.

136
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:27,199
There's all these other disturbances that are way bigger than 10 to the minus 13.

137
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,709
You know, J2 that you were talking about does 10 to the minus three J four

138
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,649
and five and those six is, okay, maybe,

139
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,250
there are three, two, three orders of magnitude smaller again.

140
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:36,685
Right?.

141
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:41,134
But still about that level, we're nowhere near 10 to the minus 13.

142
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,459
So for Earth Application that's why typically you don't see this,

143
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,115
but it is there and with these tools you can develop it.

144
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:50,564
But again, now we're getting into pretty cool missions too around other small bodies,

145
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:54,105
trying to get around boulders and flying stuff and your crafts might be, you know,

146
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,685
this might be much more of a significant effect.

147
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,290
Asteroids still tend to be basically lumps of stuff.

148
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,870
We don't build spacecraft as cannonballs or lumps of stuff.

149
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,580
This spacecraft has lots of empty space, right?

150
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,500
So the inertia ratios are still going to be big, it might still be quite small,

151
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,399
but it might not be negligible either.

152
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,670
So it's kind of a cool result people, good prelim questions, you know.

153
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,129
Does your attitude affect your orbit?

154
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,860
And the answer is yes.

155
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,410
Always, Spencer?.

156
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,379
Still a little confused as to how like small asteroid, like uneven bodies like that,

157
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,974
of the gravity gradient work as more of a factor?

158
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:29,980
Because isn't it.

159
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,144
Use a metrical force.

160
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:33,465
Force.

161
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:38,440
It's proportionately a bigger influence, because with this big square bracketed term

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,070
as basically normalized to point mass approximation of that object is just one.

163
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,806
And then how much is this going to be?

164
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:49,399
So you just have to look at, well what's my inertia?

165
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,059
And if we're still about size one, meter-ish.

166
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:56,679
You know size spacecraft and this isn't 7 million meters,

167
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,169
but now all of a sudden 50 meters,

168
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,854
because you're flying around the five meter boulder, you what I mean?

169
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:08,254
It's still going to be small, but not 10 to the minus 13 small, right?

170
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,769
And then, there's bigger binary systems and other kind of stuff people are studying.

171
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,059
It definitely makes an effect.

172
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,654
There's some binary asteroid systems, where you have,

173
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,630
you know, Shear's done a lot of work on this stuff.

174
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,269
He's got a whole book on this.

175
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,284
But then, it affects it more.

176
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,625
That makes sense.

177
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,865
So good.

178
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:28,629
So we've covered now how to derive gravity gradients, we need that one approximation

179
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,649
that the spacecraft is small compared to the orbit.

180
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,835
We got the nice vectorial way to write it and in some different coordinate frame versions.

181
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,174
This is the force version.

182
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:40,799
This is more FY, but it's just so you can see the answer.
