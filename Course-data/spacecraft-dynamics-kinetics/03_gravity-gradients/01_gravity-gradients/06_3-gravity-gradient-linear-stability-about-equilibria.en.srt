1
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:11,080
So now we found equilibrius, the next step is stability about this equilibrius.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,000
And like with the dual-spinner, at this stage,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,330
we're just going to use linear stability analysis.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,885
So, we're going to come up with these equations,

5
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:20,440
linearize and make small, and small departure approximations.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:27,339
And we're doing it in one way and in your homework you actually duplicate this,

7
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,074
but do it with MRPs instead of all our angles basically.

8
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:31,690
But it falls very much the same steps,

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,159
so that's why I'm going through this part a little bit quicker.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,369
This is much more about the high level thing, make sure the concepts make sense.

11
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,439
The mathematical details, you will do it in your homework anyway.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,905
That's where you do that.

13
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:46,539
So, now we're looking at how can we use gravity gradients.

14
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,264
These are just equilibrius, right?

15
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:52,329
And we know that this is an equilibria, and this is an equilibria.

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,799
But this equilibria is stable cause,

17
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,439
if you have a small departure, it's visually very easy to see.

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,939
This part weighs more than this one,

19
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,340
so it can have a restoring force that gets you back to the equilibrium point,

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,560
or at least towards it.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,750
It won't be asymptotic, it'll just oscillate.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,750
But this is also an equilibria.

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,370
And if you perturb it, you're going to be driven away from

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,120
that equilibria towards the other one.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,305
And so, that local motion is not going to stay linearly stable.

26
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:18,980
So, how can we identify this for all three axes,

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,569
and make this completely stable if we wish?

28
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:27,680
So, we used the same O frame again, RC, everything is there.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,685
This is from different notes for some- instead of having N, I have a big Omega.

30
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,224
That's in the orbit rate but it's the same thing, just different label.

31
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:38,900
So, that's your orbital speed that you would have,

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,465
it's basically nu over your rate, circular orbit radius cubed.

33
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:45,659
That gives you, in radians per second, your orbital speed.

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,019
And we're going to now look at, we're assuming the principle chorded frame.

35
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,399
That's a key assumption, so inertia tensor in the body frame is there.

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,614
And the motion, now we do allow non-zero angular motion, right?

37
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:04,364
If this is my equilibrium, I want to bump it and see what happens with small motions.

38
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:08,449
So now I have to account for some Omega BO's in this development, right?

39
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,444
That's how you get your equations of motion about this state.

40
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,060
So, how do we describe that here?

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,569
I'm going to use all the angles three, two, one, yard pitch roll sequence.

42
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,234
And you've seen this differential equations before.

43
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:22,504
This is how I can relate my Omega BO.

44
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:27,210
But these angles now are B body relative to orbit.

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,819
They're not body relative to inertial.

46
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,715
If we needed body relative to inertial, you know how to do that, right?

47
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:37,125
We know how to add, three, two, one, all of our angles.

48
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,919
You can map into the DCMs.

49
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,095
That's one approach, right?

50
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:43,284
Then multiply amount and pull them out again, if you have to.

51
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:46,919
So, this is what's going to go into here.

52
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:55,375
This is the constant orbit rate, but it's about 02, not about a body axis.

53
00:02:55,375 --> 00:03:00,324
So, I need the DCM to go from the orbit to the body frame,

54
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:01,910
and I'm using the same three, two, one angles.

55
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,060
So, that's this classic one you've derived,

56
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,935
this is the one we've seen in the first part of the class.

57
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:12,454
So, if I need to map my orbit motion, which is basically zero, big Omega, zero,

58
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:16,370
that's the orbit rate in the orbit frame into a vector,

59
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,884
into the body frame, you multiply times here.

60
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:23,359
So, this is going to pull out the second column at zero, big Omega,

61
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,125
zero times a three by three gives you that big Omega, times the second column.

62
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,590
That's what you end up with.

63
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,014
If you want to choose different attitude parameterizations you can do it.

64
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:37,460
It's just going to have MRPs here, or CERP, or quaternions, or whatever you want to use.

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,395
You can write this motion using whatever angles,

66
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,955
you guys are very good now with kinematics.

67
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,680
So, good.

68
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,790
Now we have, we'll make a B...

69
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,574
Both Omegas are now written in the B frame, which is nice.

70
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,500
So, we can add them up.

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,789
I add up both matrix representations of it, and so this is the math that you get.

72
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,060
So you can see the yaw pitch and roll rates, again,

73
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,925
are the motions of the body relative to the orbit frame,

74
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,699
and the big Omega accounts for that the frame itself

75
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,664
is in a constant rotational state, right?

76
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,675
So, all these terms add up there.

77
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:14,210
But that's now my Omega BN parameterized this way.

78
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,350
This is good for anything, there's no approximation in these kinematics.

79
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,634
We did assume that the spacecraft is on a circular orbit but that was about it.

80
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:27,219
So, now if we want approximate small departures,

81
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:31,444
we can actually linearize this expression for small motions.

82
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:36,245
Big Omega's not a small term, but we can assume now my yaw pitch, roll angles,

83
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:39,062
and the associated yaw pitch roll rates.

84
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:44,040
These are all going to be small oscillations, slow oscillations.

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,899
What happens there?

86
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:50,754
So, they're all treated as small variables, and we're linearizing them all about zero.

87
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,990
And then that's the result you get.

88
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,310
Let's look at the first line.

89
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,235
That's already linear, that's just your roll rate.

90
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,004
Here we have sign of pitch times yaw rate.

91
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:02,269
Well sign of pitch linearizes to pitch right?

92
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,815
Sign of X becomes approximately X for small departures.

93
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,620
So, that's small times small, it's small quadratic.

94
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,749
We drop it, right?

95
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,045
Here we have a cosine of small, linearizes to one,

96
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,875
times sine of small, linearizes to the small.

97
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,324
So, that's the first order term.

98
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:20,134
And that's what you see in the first line here.

99
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,899
So, that's what we end up with only these two terms.

100
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,819
That's our first order approximation.

101
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,774
You can do the same steps for the other two axes.

102
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:32,235
And in fact, I encourage you to do it on your own, I don't need to do this for you.

103
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,730
And in the homework, you do it with MRPs.

104
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,560
So, good.

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,029
Now, this isn't the body frame, we need, in the end, Omega dot.

106
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:44,170
But we can use our handy dandy identity that Omega is Omega BN,

107
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,435
so the N framed derivative, and the B framed derivatives are the same.

108
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,285
Right?

109
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:53,230
So, I don't have to do any cross-product stuff all I have to do is,

110
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,519
this term is going to vanish,

111
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,120
and all I have to do is take a derivative of these three matrix components,

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,404
and that is the inertial derivative of this particular Omega BN vector.

113
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,179
Right?

114
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,225
So, this is still rigorous.

115
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,399
No approximations.

116
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,026
It just means here, big Omega is constant - I'm on a circular orbit -

117
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,490
so there's no bigger make a dot.

118
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,125
Everything else receives an extra dot over it.

119
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,973
Now, I have a first order approximation for Omega dot,

120
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:21,240
first order approximation for Omega, and we can start.

121
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,810
Well, we're almost ready to start applying it to here.

122
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,660
We can linearize this term with that, this term will still be make it times Omega.

123
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,290
There's an extra step we have to do.

124
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,910
What we're still missing is the gravity gradient torque.

125
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,535
We have a general expression,

126
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,319
we need to now get an approximation

127
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,829
of the gravity gradient torque around one of these equilibrius.

128
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:45,250
How is that torque vary if I pitch, roll, yaw slightly, you know, around it.

129
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,709
So, let's look at that.

130
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,300
We did this math already earlier, this is how we get to this stuff.

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,004
Now, we have a very particular BO matrix in terms of yaw, pitch and roll,

132
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:58,060
times zero, zero something.

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,269
So, we're going to pull out the third column of this Bo matrix,

134
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:05,564
which is nothing but these sines and cosines, times RC.

135
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:10,675
So, this is now my RC one, two, and three, the B frame vector components of

136
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,069
the position vector is written this way.

137
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,735
And there's no approximation here yet.

138
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:23,000
And you can substitute this expression into this earlier expression we derived,

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,829
where we have products of RC ones, twos, and threes, and this gives you this answer now.

140
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,889
So, this is still...

141
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,150
We haven't made any small angle approximations yet in this expression.

142
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,495
This is still perfectly valid.

143
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:41,339
You can now describe your gravity gradient torques as a function of yaw, pitch,

144
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,074
and roll angles of the body relative to this orbit frame.

145
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:47,000
That's what this yaw, pitch, and roll means.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,842
And, again, you can make inertial tensors specific to make it go to zero,

147
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,509
but we're not doing that here.

148
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,035
So, we're looking at small departure motions.

149
00:07:56,035 --> 00:08:00,899
One thing that stands out is the same one.

150
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:03,660
If you look at this, because it's the third column with the DCM there,

151
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,370
there is no yaw angle in here, which actually makes somewhat physical sense.

152
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,569
Right?' We line things up, we know that if this is lined up, it's a zero gravity gradient.

153
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,600
That's true, that answer is true regardless of how I rotate about that axis.

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,334
And in this system we call that axis three,

155
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,615
and for a yaw, pitch, roll, that's a three to one rotation.

156
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:30,500
So, any three rotation doesn't really affect that gravity gradient torque.

157
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,399
That's what you find duplicated here by having used these all the angles in this sequence,

158
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,065
which is kind of nice.

159
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,690
So, this is a general expression.

160
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,740
Now we want to linearize this cause we're looking at linear results.

161
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,554
What if we have not just general big motions, but I'm just having a little wiggles, right?

162
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:52,730
These angles are going to be small cosines become one, sine of two axis, just two X again.

163
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,460
So that comes in there and another cosine to one.

164
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,440
Here you have a two- Theta becomes, sign of two Theta becomes two Theta.

165
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,070
But here you have a sine times a sine, so that small times small,

166
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,325
that's going to be higher order and drops out.

167
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:14,490
So, generally, while yaw doesn't appear, you do get a torque about the third body axis.

168
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,990
Right?

169
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,835
Nominally, the lining up B one, two, and three with 0, one, two, and three.

170
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:21,590
You do get a torque but it's actually really small.

171
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,179
That's the one that kind of helps you, though, restore yawing motion if needed.

172
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,519
Right?

173
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,659
That's what we need there.

174
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,549
But if you linearize, it's small enough to where you can drop it,

175
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:36,139
and it doesn't appear there, so that becomes a second order term that you would have.

176
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,429
So, good.

177
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:40,180
Now, we have R. With a little bit of math,

178
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,660
we've got a linearized version

179
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,769
of gravity gradient in terms of three, two, one, order angles relative to the orbit frame.

180
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,269
That's how we define all this stuff.

181
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,639
So, at this stage we're ready to start to put this together.

182
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,565
This is still our fundamental equations of motion of a rigid body,

183
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:59,594
s single rigid body, not a dual-spinner or something but close enough, right?

184
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:00,950
So, we've got this linear,

185
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,360
and we're plugging in those conditions including that the inertia tensor is diagonal.

186
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,990
This one, we've seen before, it gives you these terms, these differences,

187
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,059
with Omega twos and threes, Omega ones and threes and all the products of Omega's.

188
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:16,700
Plugging in these Omegas that's what you get.

189
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,059
And then the gravity gradient torque, it only had first and second components,

190
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,950
the third one dropped out completely in the linearization that we have.

191
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,349
So, the last step you have, because this is Omega till the I Omega,

192
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:28,850
this is still Omega squared.

193
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,460
Linearizing Omega wasn't quite enough, you still have to,

194
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,039
at this point, drop second order terms.

195
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,674
So, we can look at that.

196
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:41,639
And the pitch equation, the faded one is actually a nice example.

197
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,320
You've got pitch acceleration here, you've got pitch angles here,

198
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,039
and in between things cross coupled with yaw and roll.

199
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,620
But if you look at these terms, it's yaw rates times roll rate.

200
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,090
That small time small, drops out, yaw rates times yaw angle, again, small times small.

201
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,514
It's going to be second order.

202
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:08,149
Roll times roll rate, second order, and roll times yaw angle, also again small time small.

203
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,924
So, the second equation, once you linearize and drop the second order gyroscopic terms,

204
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:18,365
all you're going to be left with is this term, and this term.

205
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,634
That's what I've written here.

206
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,844
That's the pitch equation, right?

207
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:26,331
So, if we had- I'm flying along this way this is my one axis,

208
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,190
two axis, three, positive pitch.

209
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,889
That's basically, that's this motion.

210
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,669
If you're flying along like this, how does this motion, how is it going to be stable?

211
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,789
So now, let's look at that result.

212
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,719
When you linearize, these things always look at spring mass damper systems, right?

213
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,460
And there's no damping in this system, it's gravity, it's a conservative force.

214
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,330
It's like, it just adding a springiness to the system, that's all you get out of it.

215
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,029
So, there is never asymptotic convergence with gravity gradient stabilization,

216
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,909
it's just a marginal stability like a spring and a mass.

217
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,934
And if it's deflected, it's going to oscillate but it shouldn't get bigger or smaller,

218
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,625
at least not within the linear stuff that you're doing.

219
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,644
So, this is our stiffness that we have to look at,

220
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:10,320
and to make this pitch motion stable, we need this to be positive.

221
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,365
Three is positive, a real number squared guaranteed positive.

222
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:18,995
I2, principle inertias, they're all positive - you never have negative principle inertias.

223
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,220
I haven't seen anybody build such a structure.

224
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,644
So, the only way to make this positive negative is through the relative size of I1 and I3.

225
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:35,269
So, the way this is written I1 actually has to be bigger than I3

226
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,580
for the pitch motion to be stable.

227
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,284
Now, again, what I1 and 3 mean?

228
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:45,115
These are the principle inertias we've linearized about the O frame.

229
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:51,615
So I1 is the inertia of the craft nominally aligned with the 01 axis,

230
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:58,429
and the I3 is the inertia of the craft nominally about the 03 axis to orbit radial axis.

231
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,740
So, if you look at the spacecraft, pretty distinct inertias,

232
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,399
this would be gravity gradient stable for pitch motion.

233
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm flying this way, so the inertia about this axis, this inertia is I1.

234
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,575
It's definitely much bigger than the inertia about the gravity axis three, right?

235
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:22,434
This is much skinnier than this, and that would be stable.

236
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,549
So, the pitch motions actually would be stable.

237
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,875
If you reverse that, well, now all of the sudden,

238
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,664
you have a negative stiffness, and that's how it appears mathematically.

239
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:31,804
This would deviate.

240
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,125
But there's other ways you can do this as well.

241
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,164
There's other shapes.

242
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:40,340
I1 had to be bigger so you could fly.

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,980
Then this, so this way you could fly it as well.

244
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,990
And let's see.

245
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,475
No, that wouldn't work, I3 is now this.

246
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:52,882
This is I2, if I do it.

247
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:53,490
How do I have to do this then?

248
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:01,440
So, if I want this to be larger, I fly it there, and this to not to be the skinniest one

249
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,575
- but I could fly, I could fly this way basically.

250
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:08,639
And then the pitch motion, which kind of makes geometric sense, this would also be stable,

251
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,370
right?

252
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,039
So, it's different.

253
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,094
That's what comes out of it.

254
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:12,720
If you want to pitch motion to be stable,

255
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,809
you have to line up your spacecraft such that O1 axis inertia

256
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,284
is bigger than the 03 axis inertia.

257
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:22,740
Now, that just stabilizes one of the angles.

258
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,924
It doesn't guarantee that yaw and roll are going to be stable, in this case.

259
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:31,029
So we have to look at the other two differential equations.

260
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,603
Now, the fate of one actually- let me look at that one again -

261
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:41,970
here, there were some faded dots that appeared but then multiply times here and here,

262
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,169
they're all small.

263
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,169
The only one that's first order is going to be this product.

264
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:50,059
And the same thing down here, there's a [inaudible] times this.

265
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,580
Everything else is going to be dropping out a second order.

266
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,299
So, the theta dots drop out of the roll and pitch at the roll and yaw equations,

267
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,965
and the pitch are perfectly decoupled from the other two.

268
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,399
So, pitch this is what we need.

269
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,740
Now we're focusing on roll and yaw motion, which to first order decouple.

270
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,820
This form of writing it, takes a little bit of algebra - quickly a few steps.

271
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,129
This is just a classic form you find in a lot of textbooks

272
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,355
and papers that deal with this topic.

273
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:19,799
People come up with these KR and Ky ratios which are differences,

274
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,975
inertia, two minus the other, two minus the other, divided by the third basically.

275
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:25,970
That's what they've done.

276
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,315
And there's probably historical reasons for that.

277
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,009
But this is how they rewrite it.

278
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,884
So, now we ended up with second order coupled differential equations.

279
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:37,740
And we have to look at the stability of this.

280
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,840
The way you do this in linear controls, a linear analysis, dynamic analysis class.

281
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,930
We look at the characteristic equation, right?

282
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,600
You write this stuff up into first order form, get the determinant of the,

283
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,004
you know, one minus, that matrix sends s, get the determinant.

284
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:55,830
This in the first order form - because the second or differential equation

285
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,419
- would give me a four dimensional state.

286
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:01,930
Roll, pitch, sorry, yaw, roll, yaw-rate, roll-rate.

287
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,134
So, you end up with a fourth order polynomial.

288
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:10,585
What has to be true of the roots of this characteristic equation?

289
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:14,289
Well, they can't have any positive real parts.

290
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,254
These roots can be real, they can be imaginary, that's fine too.

291
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,590
Imaginary tipping implies oscillatory motions,

292
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,995
real roots implies asymptotic convergence or divergence depending on where they are.

293
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,924
And we just need real parts of it, right?

294
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,409
So, all four roots we have to make sure they're either on,

295
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,980
basically, not on the positive plain but on the negative,

296
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,534
or the imaginary axis, to guarantee some form of stability.

297
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:41,125
Now there's different criteria.

298
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,659
Some of you have taken classes on this,

299
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,315
you might have recognized this Routh Hurwitz criteria

300
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,324
that you can use, and I'll apply that here in a moment.

301
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:49,394
I'm not going into the details, it's really not important.

302
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,139
If you haven't seen this, there's whole courses you can take on this.

303
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,809
This is more about the results for the level of this class,

304
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,464
you are not hand-deriving these conditions.

305
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:00,730
But, in essence, we've got a quartic term,

306
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,744
we've got a quadratic term and then a zeroth order term.

307
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,890
And that's something we can take heavy advantage of.

308
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,849
It's easier to get roots because you could read,

309
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,134
instead of solving for Lambda, you basically solved it for Lambda squared,

310
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,079
which is the quadratic form.

311
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,220
And then the square root of that gives you the actual roots.

312
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,259
That's how you find all four possible routes cause

313
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:21,805
it's always plus minuses and how does that work.

314
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:24,000
So, that's what we're going to use.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,759
Now, skipping a bunch of derivations, this is what you find on these kinds of topics.

316
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,615
These are the conditions in terms of those betas.

317
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,329
This is how those terms are defined,

318
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,744
and this is the inertia ratios, how you have to highlight this.

319
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:40,274
This is what would guarantee that all the roots are not positive.

320
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:46,249
In the KR-KY space, which has these ratios, how do you size stuff?

321
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:49,420
That's the equivalent kind of condition.

322
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,285
This one I added.

323
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,180
This came from the pitch conditions,

324
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,464
and the pitch conditions written in KR-KY just mean KY has to be bigger than KR.

325
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,670
So, if you think of that condition,

326
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,299
it gives you one half of the whole KR-KY space

327
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,154
that drops out because you have to be on the plus side.

328
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:11,089
This one, too, actually, KR, X times Y has to be positive.

329
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:16,349
Well, that means that your X and Y are either positive or X and Y are both negative.

330
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:16,839
Right?

331
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,720
Then the product is going to be positive.

332
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,869
So that means your answers have to be either in the quadrant.

333
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,364
So if you're looking at it- Now, we'll see the quatrains in a moment.

334
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:27,974
But that restricts it to two quadrants.

335
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:32,819
Just instead of using X, KR-KY written in terms of inertia,

336
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,500
looking at how they are defined.

337
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,184
This really boils down to this second inertia has to either be the largest -

338
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:44,315
so that's the inertia about the 02, that's the inertia about the orbit normal axis,

339
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:50,950
it's all equivalent - it has to either be the largest inertia or the least inertia.

340
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,279
And these four conditions you're seeing here.

341
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,819
If we plug those visually,

342
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,900
and you can get discovered Matlab, mathematica, and plot these things out.

343
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,200
This is what you end up with.

344
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,700
So, we have these conditions that we had to be, one had to be bigger than the other.

345
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,954
The product had to be positive which put this in this quadrant or this quadrant.

346
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:15,680
And the other ones that inequality gave us this region that were stable,

347
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,210
or this slither here.

348
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,930
The slither is because of this other constraint that we had from this equation,

349
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,789
which gets a little bit more complicated to visualize,

350
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,660
but that's what happens mathematically.

351
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,430
This is what guarantees that we have stability.

352
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,115
So, what does this mean?

353
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:34,049
This means, in these regions, if I have my -

354
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,100
and this one has basically, it boils down to I2 so the largest inertia

355
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,994
- in this region here, just little white region,

356
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:43,954
you have a condition where I2 is the least inertia.

357
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:49,744
In both of them, if I have small departures, not just in pitch but in yaw,

358
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:56,630
or in roll as well, that these motions would stay stable.

359
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,250
It won't just start to tumble about other axes

360
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,119
cause you could be stable this way but then unstable about this axis,

361
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,499
and that wouldn't be good for the space station;

362
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:07,040
they don't like to flip upside down, right?

363
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,049
So, those are the two possible regions.

364
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,234
We typically fly this kind of a scenario.

365
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:16,795
That means I2 is the largest inertia.

366
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,589
I'm sure many of you have seen the images of the space shuttle,

367
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,609
it's flying, its happy, its nose is typically pointing up.

368
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:26,869
For the space shuttle the nose is actually the axis of least inertia.

369
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:28,864
So, it's kind of like the skinny side, right?

370
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,494
With the wings going out,

371
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:34,095
and everything, that's the axis of maximum inertia like this flat plate.

372
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:37,008
And then the axis along from wingtip to wingtip.

373
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:40,305
If you look at a side profile, it's more than looking at the nose,

374
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,000
but it's not as much as looking at the broad side.

375
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,025
So that's the axis of the two axes, it's the axis of intermediate inertia.

376
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:50,505
What this says is, you have to pick your maximum inertia,

377
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:53,819
which is basically looking straight out from the cargo bay from the shuttle, you know.

378
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,694
Wings are sticking out, noses up.

379
00:20:56,694 --> 00:21:00,290
You want that to line up with your orbit normal.

380
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,140
So if you're flying along this way - this is my local gravity direction -

381
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,724
my axis of flight direction, and then my normal axis is this way.

382
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,009
I have to line up my cargo bay with the orbit normal, essentially.

383
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,900
That's what I have to do.

384
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,849
Then I still need, I want bigger than I3, so the inertia about my long track axis,

385
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:23,579
which is this axis, has to be bigger than the inertia about my orbit radius axis,

386
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,130
which is my local vertical.

387
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,134
That's why the space shuttle tends to fly this sidestepping motion.

388
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:29,130
Well, it used to fly.

389
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,439
That was its gravity gradient stabilized orientation.

390
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,690
It didn't take any fuel, any thrust, little astronauts wake up bump the wall.

391
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,359
That was enough to just kind of stay close, and it didn't go crazy, you know.

392
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,055
But that's where these inertia ratios come from.

393
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:47,890
If you're going to fly one here, it's trickier.

394
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,100
This is a first order analysis.

395
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,525
Higher order terms are ignored.

396
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:56,250
In particular flexing has been ignored.

397
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,605
So, if we have it's not rigid but things could move,

398
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:04,315
this quickly can become unstable as well, which you have to be really careful, ok?

399
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:08,279
So, historically, People like this one but, again, first order analysis is nice.

400
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,919
Life isn't first order, life isn't linear, it's non-linear and messy,

401
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,005
and these higher order terms might have, actually, a strong impact,

402
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:20,005
especially the flexing part, you know, the small attitude.

403
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,109
If it were rigid, this is all rigorous and right.

404
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,234
But if you have flexing happening all of a sudden with the motions,

405
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:29,355
does that give you gyroscopic stack and, you know,

406
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:32,279
the stability you have is this big and the gyroscopic is this big,

407
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,599
the gyroscopic is going to overrule and take you all over the place.
