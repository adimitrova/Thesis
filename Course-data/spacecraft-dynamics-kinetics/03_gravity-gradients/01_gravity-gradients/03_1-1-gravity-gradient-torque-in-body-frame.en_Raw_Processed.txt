so good 
this is vector form, 
coordinate independent form 
lets actually apply 
particular frames 
theres different answers 
that we get this 
always answer, 
different expressions, 
different formulations 
that answer 
so if im using an orbit frame, 
here ive used an aircraftlike frame, 
if an airplane is flying you 
nose pointing in one direction, 
wings may to left right 
i yaw axis up, 
aircraft probably would 
orbits we tend 
to third axis 
one axis in 
radial direction 
so, is long track, 
is cross track orbit normal, 
is orbit radius direction vector 
theyre unit direction vectors 
that means rc definition is always 
going to , kilometers in that 
direction, right 
that direction is defined here 
so, in o frame, position vector 
a circular orbit in particular, 
is going to constant 
going to , , rc, 
right, is kind nice 
so we write that 
weve seen spacecraft part, 
inertia tensor, 
we tend to write in body frame 
so while orbit positions could 
written in simple manners, 
we tend to need in body frame 
now, so if this is position 
vector pointing to satellite, 
youve got a coordinate frame 
satellite, depending orientation, 
you an infinity different 
variations, generally, 
youre going to to account 
three different vector components, 
rc inertial position vector, always 
so, rc , , , nothing 
b frame components position vector, 
different ways to look 
so we that 
we plug this in, 
i added this morning 
everythings in body frame 
to make explicit 
so we rc, cross i rc 
ive picked a principal coordinate 
frame here to make, 
i always that 
a rigid body, right 
exists, makes 
analysis a little bit easier 
you this math, 
this multiplication is talking 
you get a little bit scaling, 
cross product, 
this is going to answer 
so this box, answers 
earlier one 
expressed everything 
in body frame components 
we look 
conditions 
try to figure will gravity 
gradient torque go to zero 
i care going to zero 
equilibrious that 
to study, 
thats thing if you conditions 
this is one disturbance youre 
modeling, if that disturbance acts it, 
you wont an equilibrious 
this is like gravity gradients 
we talked last time 
this would a gravity 
gradient equilibria 
if you disturb it, then, 
this one weigh this 
point makes restore 
so orientations 
shapes give us that 
you guys mentioned earlier, 
one way to make things go to zero 
is simply differences 
to vanish 
that means, you guys already 
identified, is that principal 
inertias must equal is either 
a sphere a cube, kinds shapes 
so, there particular shapes that 
make attitude go to 
thats so 
gravity gradient torque go to 
thats important, there a 
satellite that we built here called dandy 
anybody know that one 
heard a little bit, right 
a sphere reason like that so 
we could this stuff, 
didnt gravity gradient 
torques disturbing i really wanted 
to measure atmospheric force effects, 
i didnt need disturbances 
acting much 
so that really leading to this 
decision, right, that gave us zero 
gravity gradient torques, 
also atmospheric drag effects so 
you didnt weird panels sticking out, 
there reasons 
so way we make go to 
zero is we look components 
there particular orientations 
remember, rc one two three, 
position vector always 
points to straight outward 
depending attitude, i will 
different rc , , components 
there different orientations that 
will force this lg to go to zero 
answer im showing you 
is rc is equal to rc times bi 
so, is david 
that mean orientation, 
if rc is equal to rc bi hat 
mean youre aligning body 
axis o frame that you created 
specific, 
part o frame 
radius vector 
right, if you say youre adding 
a body axis relative to o frame 
if theyre principal inertia axis 
that implies 
principal inertia axis 
to line o frame, 
thats true 
so second argument is correct, 
we really care is 
rc part here that we have, right 
thats in o direction here, 
basically orbit to radium to axis 
so that says is 
position vector that direction to 
a principal axis body 
that could b, b, b 
locking 
one r axis in 
im going to use to 
three distinct axis, right 
so we have, this is a principal axis, 
this is a principal axis, 
this is a principal axis 
says that if i line one 
things a principal axis 
lets simple example, right 
here i skinny axis 
in vertical direction 
that satisfies that condition 
if i rotate that axis, 
this is still in equilibrium, 
symmetry stuff, right 
so you see, 
that orientation doesnt matter 
matters that one 
principal axes is lined 
this is another one that we identified, 
right gravity gradients 
even cancelled 
i rotate that 
gravity direction 
i still a zero gravity 
gradient torque, right 
thats this condition means 
so locks one body axis to 
aligned orbit direction vector 
thats 
still leaves an infinity 
orientations you rotate 
that local vertical axis 
okay, good, yes 
inaudible 
thinking like j that stuff 
inaudible 
theyre pretty small 
j is a thousand times 
smaller regular stuff 
so if you care accuracies, you 
could that youd to account 
that in developments, 
that would actual terms 
i dont typically see 
this is already a pretty small torque 
many simulations dont even include this, 
if you include it, great, 
j is much, much smaller 
if youre going around asteroids, 
thats a whole different problem 
if youre looking 
an asteroid binary system, 
i know you this year 
might looking 
thats a full thing 
you expansions 
like ive done 
two bodies treating earth 
a big point mass, a big thing 
earth, is spherical 
far that goes, right 
yep, no, great question 
so, this would modified 
process is same, you might 
extra conditions to line 
local area, that mean
