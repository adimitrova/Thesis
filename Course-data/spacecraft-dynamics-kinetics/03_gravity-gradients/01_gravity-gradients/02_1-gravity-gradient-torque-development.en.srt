1
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:08,880
Gravity Gradients.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,269
This is kind of the last big thing we're doing in dynamics.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,250
We've looked at single rigid body, we've looked that now, you know, torque free,

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,589
with a little torque, some homework, you know, a little torque.

5
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:21,936
They move the dual spinner just in the rigid body.

6
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:25,646
That's a way to passively stabilize, there's no active feedback control,

7
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:29,839
you have to make sure you designed it with the right spin rate, so the system is stable.

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,620
The other way we can passively stabilize the system is with gravity gradients, right?

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,840
This is all about, if you look at this pen,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,100
this lower part of the pen is closer to the Earth than the upper part of the pen

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,598
and the gravitational acceleration depends on one over R squared.

12
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,715
So things closer to the center of the Earth weigh more.

13
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,719
Even though it's the same mass here and here, they have a stronger force

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,149
and that gives you the gradient that acts on it, right?

15
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,975
There's a gradient across the body and how strong the gravity forces are.

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,640
So, now we want to look at these gradients on general objects

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,819
and figure out what are the forces, what are the torques,

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,650
what are the equilibrium's, and what are the stabilities.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,370
Again, the same classic things that we did with the dual-spinner,

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,344
getting these torques though is a little bit more interesting.

21
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:18,569
So, gravity gradients tend to be tall and slender.

22
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:21,780
This is the typical gravity gradient kind of this configuration.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,109
Why?

24
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,510
Because if this thing is the normal condition,

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,584
it turns out here the gravity gradients still give you zero torque.

26
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:31,429
They all act, all the gravity forces act through the center of mass,

27
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,519
so there's no torque about the center of mass.

28
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,965
But if I twist it, and this one gets pulled stronger than this one,

29
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,549
you get a restoring force, which actually helps stabilize it.

30
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,090
This will end up being another gravity gradient where everything has essentially

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,250
the same distance from the center of the Earth.

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,275
So you'll get the same force, and they all just balance out, there's no torque.

33
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,234
But if I twist this one slightly,

34
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:58,374
this one now weighs more than this one and you get a destabilizing effect, right?

35
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,260
So, as with the dual-spinner, sometimes equilibrium's can be stable

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,289
and sometimes unstable and we like to find this way this for anti-symmetric.

37
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,960
What we want to derive is for general inertias at the space shuttle.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,979
It has a very particular orientation when it was flying in a gravity gradient orientation.

39
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,197
Why?

40
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,085
Where does that come from?

41
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,049
So, it's the tidal forces.

42
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,159
So, we're going to get to mass and flying blobs again.

43
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,580
So, we're going to say, this is a general object.

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,355
It's going to be a rigid body in this case, we're not flying Jello,

45
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,060
we're just flying rigid spacecraft.

46
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,569
But we have our typical R,

47
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,824
that's the inertial position vector of your little infinitesimal mass element, every bolt,

48
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:36,150
every screw, every panel, right, we're accounting for.

49
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,176
And it's position, inertially, can be written as the position of the center of mass

50
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,985
of the spacecraft,plus the bolts position relative

51
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,965
to the center mass of the spacecraft, right?

52
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,259
Just what we did earlier.

53
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,280
Now, the gravity acting on this differential element,

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,473
if you look at Newton's Universal Law of Gravity you've got that G,

55
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:56,955
the mass of the Earth, the mass of the elements, right?

56
00:02:56,955 --> 00:03:02,819
G times N one, N two, but N one is Earth in and N two is DM divided by distance squared.

57
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,485
That would be this distance times a direction and it has to be in the minus R direction.

58
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,905
I probably should have drawn this arrow, this down here, that would have made more sense.

59
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,965
Anyway, next time.

60
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:20,430
But that's the mathematics, that's just Newton's Gravity Law acting on a DM particle.

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,680
Now, we have these classic definitions.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,541
So what we're going to do now is we're going to first look at torques,

63
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,930
gravity gradient torques, about the center of mass.

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,555
So, I have this point here, I need to get the moment arm crossed with this force.

65
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,610
That's how we did torque, right,

66
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,250
position where we applied a force crossed with the force itself,

67
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,109
about the moment, about the point C.

68
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,289
So, this would be easy.

69
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,555
That's little R crossed with this DF that we have.

70
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,050
And DF is repeated here.

71
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,110
So, we start to plug it in and substitute stuff.

72
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,050
The first step, we put this in here and R is RC plus little R.

73
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,854
Quickly you'll see while there's an R cross RC, and a little R cross little R.

74
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,510
What does that become?

75
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,819
Zero, right?

76
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:04,750
And we love zero by now.

77
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,889
Zero is really nice.

78
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,199
Zero is our friend.

79
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,960
So, immediately this term is going to drop out and it won't contribute to the torque.

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,129
So, we like that.

81
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,490
We end up with RC, we can take outside the integral,

82
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,339
as we argued earlier and, you know, in blobs and space.

83
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,439
For the system every point in that system has the same center of mass location.

84
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,242
So it's not impacted by this body integral, But that leaves you with this.

85
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:29,545
Now, R does depend, right?

86
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:32,634
R is RC plus little R, so it's got little r imbedded.

87
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:35,569
You can't move that R outside.

88
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,545
This is where you end up with.

89
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,574
Now, this is where all up to now.

90
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:41,920
This is rigorous, and no approximation.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,235
What we're going to do now is this is R cubed.

92
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,790
That's where all the complications come in

93
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,149
and we're going to do a first order approximation.

94
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,825
R cubed is bloody close to RC cubed, right?

95
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,879
7,000 kilometers from the center of the Earth,

96
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,999
and then we're looking at a half a meter distance.

97
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:06,317
That's really not going to change at 7,000 kilometers too much, right?

98
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,529
As can be very, very close, which motivates,

99
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:13,240
let's take a first order approximation of this and you get a really good analytical answer

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,000
to these gravity gradient torques.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,430
So, we have to do a linearization,

102
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,480
essentially and I'm showing here how you can take this, plug in this stuff.

103
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,389
I'm doing a binomial expansion, factor things out,

104
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,089
and in the end you're dropping off,

105
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,264
you have to do this linearization of this term and you end up with this.

106
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,270
This is your zeroth order term, one over RC cube,

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,050
which kind of makes sense, minus this times this.

108
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,529
This is your first order term, the first order here is in terms of R, little R, right?

109
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,845
You may have done Taylor Series Expansion in terms of X's and Y's and Z's.

110
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,019
I expect you not to do a Taylor Series Expansion terms of vectorial quantities.

111
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,899
So, I'm going to do this once with you here.

112
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:59,535
But this is definitely a skill on an exam I would expect you to be able to do.

113
00:05:59,535 --> 00:05:59,819
Okay.

114
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:00,639
Let me get my notes up.

115
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,154
Quickly.

116
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,189
Yeah, that will work.

117
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:12,845
So, what we're trying to do is, we have this one term.

118
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,800
The thing I'm trying to expand about

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,709
is I'm treating little R as the small quantity, right?

120
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,189
RC is the big quantity, that's 7,000 kilometers to your left.

121
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,680
But then, I only have little wiggles of plus\minus a fraction

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,189
of a meter across the spacecraft,right?

123
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,220
So little R is a small thing,

124
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,309
and the function I'm trying to approximate is one over R cubed,

125
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,410
which is the same thing as R to the minus third.

126
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,639
R is just a scalar.

127
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,889
R is always defined that way.

128
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,225
So, now, if you look at a Taylor Series Expansion, if you have F of X,

129
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:50,189
and we're doing an expansion about XR, just X is a scalar in this case,

130
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,305
you would say Taylor says, 'Okay, that is the F at the reference point,

131
00:06:55,305 --> 00:07:02,654
plus one over one, vectorial times, the partial of F with respect to this state'.

132
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:09,170
And then this partial is evaluated at the reference times Delta X.

133
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,859
And Delta X would simply be X minus XR, right?

134
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,180
And then you can go second order and higher.

135
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,649
We're not going to go second order here, right?

136
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,754
That's the classic Taylor Series Expansion.

137
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:23,189
Let's apply this now here,

138
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,180
where this function depends on a vector not a scalar.

139
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,639
Now, the function itself is a scalar function that makes life a little bit easier.

140
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,254
So, we have to figure out these terms.

141
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,810
So, applying this here we're going to say F

142
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,649
of R is approximated as F at the reference which is F,

143
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:49,254
at the reference is the center of mass, that means R is equal to zero.

144
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:54,894
Plus, one over one factorial, which is just one over one which is one,

145
00:07:54,894 --> 00:08:02,180
times the partial of F with respect to R evaluated at the reference,

146
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,814
that's R is equal to zero.

147
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,230
That's the center of mass location.

148
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,680
Everything is about the center of mass now times

149
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,420
instead of this is the vector dot product with the small quantity,

150
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,180
which in this case is just R.

151
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,389
R is the small quantity.

152
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,259
So, we're doing the expansion about R is equal to zero, essentially.

153
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,560
This part, if R is equal to zero then R magnitude is equal to RC magnitude,

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,819
and that's just going to be RC to the minus third, right?

155
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:36,485
That one's trivial.

156
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:37,934
Let's look at this.

157
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:42,570
This part we have to figure out first is partial derivative of it.

158
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,269
So, if F is R to the minus, third the partial of F with respect to little R,

159
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:55,079
chain rule, you know, that's going to be minus three times R to the minus fourth times

160
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,974
the partial of the radius with respect to this little R vector.

161
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,331
So, good?

162
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:03,500
We get there.

163
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,580
Now, we need to find this quantity.

164
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,519
So, to do that relationship I'm just going to go back to this stuff.

165
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,654
R squared is really this vector dotted with itself,

166
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:26,052
which is the same thing as RC plus little R dotted with RC plus little R, right?

167
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:30,360
The magnitude squared of a vector is just a dot product of the vector itself,

168
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,705
and the vector is written in terms of a song.

169
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,345
So, we've got that, good.

170
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,870
Now, I have the scalars here, this is a scalar at the end,

171
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,404
but it's a scalar in terms of these vectorial quantities and some vector math.

172
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:44,071
Now, taking the derivative of this these, these partials,

173
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,600
hopefully you remember how to take partial derivatives, on the left hand side.

174
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,879
I'm just going to get two times R, times the partial of R with respect to little R.

175
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,360
On the right hand side, if I carry this out,

176
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,940
I need to take the partial derivative of, let's see.

177
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,834
Here you're going to have RC dotted with RC,

178
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:13,284
plus two times RC dotted with an R, plus little R dotted with itself.

179
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:17,830
This part doesn't depend on little R, so that partial is going to drop out.

180
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:25,389
Here two RC times R, the partial of a vector with a with respect to itself,

181
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,220
which is going to give you identity operator.

182
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,535
So, like the partial of X with respect to X just gives you one, right?

183
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:35,874
So, in this case you can end up with two times RC

184
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:41,115
from this partial and then here this dotted with itself.

185
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:43,929
Like we talked about earlier, you know, when we had R transpose.

186
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:45,540
R take the time derivative,

187
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,730
you get to two times R transposed R dot or taking partial derivatives.

188
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,750
This just gives you two times the R vector, in that case.

189
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,259
Yup.

190
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,355
So, if you're fuzzy on this, practice with this, approve these identities to do so,

191
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:04,149
it just takes one or two steps.

192
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,980
Now, I'm looking for this partial, so I can... I'm just going to rewrite this.

193
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,475
These twos all cancel.

194
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:24,570
So the partial of R with respect to little R is just one over R times RC plus little R.

195
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:24,830
All right?

196
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,240
That's what we have.

197
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,429
Now, we can plug this back into here and we'll see what we're going to get.

198
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:39,070
We have minus three R to the four, minus fourth is another one,

199
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,949
so R to the minus fifth, times RC plus little R.

200
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,679
You go, okay, getting close.

201
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:55,504
Now, we have to evaluate this sensitivity here at the reference where R is equal to zero.

202
00:11:55,504 --> 00:12:01,495
So, if I compute that partial of this with respect to little R at R is equal to zero,

203
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:07,485
then this R just becomes RC, and this little R just becomes zero.

204
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:17,450
And what you will end up with is minus three over RC to the fifth,

205
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,200
times RC vector, essentially.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,445
And now, we're just about there.

207
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:29,399
So, the first order expansion of this function is simply RC to the minus third,

208
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,779
plus this term dotted with the little R vector.

209
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,634
And if I go look at my final result here,

210
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,340
that's exactly what I had, one over RC to the third,

211
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,388
minus three RC over RC to the fifth because three times two is five,

212
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:51,103
three plus two is five, dotted with that first order expansion.

213
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,865
Right?

214
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:55,825
So, we've gone through this reasonably quickly.

215
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,739
This is something it's not going to sink in unless you do it yourself,

216
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,122
and I think in one of the hallmarks, I'm asking you to do this.

217
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,299
Derive this, make sure you can do these different binomial expansions

218
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,590
and then linearize this or just start from front, which I showed you with that,

219
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,889
you know, make sure you know how to take partials of, you know, typical gradient.

220
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,227
This is your sophomore level calculus or freshman level calculus,

221
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,899
whenever you took Calc II that kind of stuff like, right?

222
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,389
Partials of scales with respect to vectors, just gradients that we have to get.

223
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,039
That's all we have to compute because now we can plug this.

224
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,054
Now we're making this assumption that this R,

225
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,840
this spacecraft is small compared to the orbit.

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,235
This is not the Star Wars, Death Star orbiting Endor or something.

227
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,057
There this approximation wouldn't hold.

228
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:37,600
For current man-made object it's a pretty good approximation.

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,389
So, if you plug that in, this is where we had that R over this other stuff,

230
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,490
this is what that stuff combines.

231
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,184
I've taken some of the constants outside.

232
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:52,214
You carry out this multiplication, you will see the body integral of RDM,

233
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:55,414
which we know from the center of mass definition goes to zero.

234
00:13:55,414 --> 00:14:00,759
We still have zero one term less to worry about and that leaves you with this part.

235
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,610
Here, this one doesn't quite look convenient,

236
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,860
but in essence you can see it's mass times distance squared.

237
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,057
At this point, hopefully,

238
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,980
your spidey sense is tingling and this looks like something

239
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,169
that could be related to inertia.

240
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:19,585
And so, we have to re-manipulate these equations, again, to get to that form.

241
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,179
So, if you do that we have lots of different vector identities,

242
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,897
one of them is double cross product and if I solve for minus this term,

243
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:30,879
you just bring this over, this over to the other side, and then you got it,

244
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,985
you can relate that, this is what's inside that integral term, precisely.

245
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:38,789
So, A is equal to little R, C is equal to RC, B is equal to little R.

246
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,750
You apply the vector identity, you end up with this stuff, right?

247
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,289
So, doing that though, now you can see immediately we've got little R, till D,

248
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,940
minus little R till the little R till D, that will go back into our body integral.

249
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,429
Hopefully, you already at this part recognize that's going to be the inertia term.

250
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,699
We have something else we need to identify.

251
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,139
So we plug that in.

252
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,549
You get to here and, so the only assumption,

253
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,027
so far, still is that little R is small compared to RC,

254
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,980
spacecraft is small compared to the radius of the orbit.

255
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,845
That first term, you can factor out RC to the left, which is done already,

256
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,745
you can factor in RC to the right.

257
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:22,745
Because it doesn't matter on the body integral, that means you move the DM inside,

258
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:25,870
and then you end up with the classic definition.

259
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,049
The other one is RC here, you can take that outside,

260
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,195
and then you just have the body integral of little R dotted with itself,

261
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:35,274
which is just R squared, which we can do.

262
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:39,150
So this term is what we can recognize as the inertia tensor, right?

263
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,289
That appears all these different places.

264
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,654
This one here is actually a polar moment of inertia.

265
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:49,985
But here we don't care about it, because the RC's you factored out,

266
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:56,469
give you an RC crossed RC, which of course, again, goes to zero, which we like, right?

267
00:15:56,469 --> 00:16:04,933
So that second term vanishes completely with this mathematics and now you end up with,

268
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,119
I use in this inertia tensor definition.

269
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:11,014
We end up with this expression of, this is basically the linear, you know,

270
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:11,882
this is the first order.

271
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:14,629
I shouldn't say linearized, we'll do that differently later.

272
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:20,249
This is the first order approximation of the gravity gradient torque, right?

273
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:23,585
When we expanded one over R cubed, we only kept first order term.

274
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:26,875
If you want higher order terms, you'd have to include those in expansions,

275
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,039
and then it would be this plus some other stuff.

276
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,309
That would happen.

277
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:37,539
Now, when we write this, have I specified a particular coordinate frame

278
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:43,670
that you have to express everything in?

279
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,100
Horace?.

280
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,100
No.

281
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,360
No, it's just vectors, vectors, even the tensor stuff, right?

282
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,620
We know when we evaluate this we have to pick probably somebody fixed frame.

283
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,179
That's how we do it mathematically.

284
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,389
But generally we can write the tensor just as a coordinate frame independent way.

285
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,870
If you have it in the B frame, and you need in the C frame,

286
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,579
we know we have to pre- and post- multiply

287
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,250
with the DCM to do a coordinate transformation, right?

288
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,904
But we treat the inertia tensor just like a body, a position vector or velocity vector.

289
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,980
So, we can write them in a very agnostic ways, which is nice.

290
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,049
It just means when you evaluate this make sure you have your orbit in the same frame

291
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,559
as your inertial tensor.

292
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,855
What coordinate system do we typically use for orbits?

293
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:28,073
Mandar?

294
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,340
Inertial?

295
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,700
You could do inertial, right?

296
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,975
You might even use an orbit frame, we'll see later on, a rotating orbit frame, right?

297
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:39,529
You don't typically use a body frame.

298
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,079
That's probably the least you scream for an orbit

299
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,299
because then it couples everything in crazy ways, right?

300
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,599
We want something different.

301
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,174
But the inertia tensor, we tend to express that one in the body frame.

302
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,920
So, this is just an equation where, right up front,

303
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,420
I can tell that you probably are going to be given this information, in real life,

304
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,075
using different frames, and that's fine.

305
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:03,474
So, implied in here is maybe a DCM rotation that you have to do.

306
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:08,089
You know, the tensor of the vectors are mapped from one frame to another, that's all.

307
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,410
So, this is the most compact way I can write it.

308
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,295
But again, implied might be some important transformation when you actually evaluate it.

309
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:20,585
So, looking at this, let's just jump ahead quickly.

310
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:27,855
Can anybody tell me for what type of inertia tensor will LG go to zero?

311
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:33,740
T-Bo?

312
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,759
It's diagonal, enough, probably not, just a identity scale.

313
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,914
Yes, diagonals running off.

314
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,626
If you have distinct three different inertias, this is not going to go to zero,

315
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,885
because you actually scaled this vector in a way

316
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:48,565
that it's no longer co-linear with itself, right?

317
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,650
But if it's an identity times a scalar,

318
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,830
so what kind of shapes give us those kinds of tensors?

319
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,072
Sphere.

320
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:54,849
Sphere and?

321
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:55,466
Cubed.

322
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,345
Cube, right?

323
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,559
Keep that because we'll see that result again in other mathematics as well.

324
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,066
So, here just in a vectorial form you can see with the cross-product.

325
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:06,940
If it's a cross-product times itself, whatever shape makes that happen,

326
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,544
that would make the gravity gradient torques,

327
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:12,480
actually, to be zeroregardless of attitude.
