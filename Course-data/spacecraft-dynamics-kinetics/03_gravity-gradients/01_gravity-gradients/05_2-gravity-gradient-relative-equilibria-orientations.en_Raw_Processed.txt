next thing you want to is that we 
a model gravity gradient torque, 
we want to talk equilibrium 
in this application, i 
word relative equilibrium state 
we talked equilibria simply meaning, 
if we x dot equal to f a dynamical 
system, equilibrium means 
states x is x dot going to zero 
right, thats 
then, fixed points in 
states phase flows phase, 
whatever you might want to call 
a relative equilibrium 
means looking 
stuff spacecraft rotation 
relative to inertial is constant 
actually, 
relative to a rotating frame 
you typically in orbits is, 
we care motion a spacecraft 
seen a rotating orbit frame 
we a frame that line, 
one axis lines orbit radial, 
old frame is an old radial, alright 
one is long track, 
one is a cross track stuff 
thats a rotating orbit frame 
we often care, 
if im flying to space station like that, 
always pointing earth, im actually 
interested in motion space 
station, relative to this orbit frame 
gravity, torques 
everything gyroscopics effect that 
so going to look 
relative equilibrias here 
equations motion is 
a rigid body, we derived 
b relative to n, still, right 
this is gravity gradient 
torque we derive 
we plug that in in different 
forms stuff 
omega bn is angular motion 
b relative to orbit frame 
plus orbit frame motion 
in this analysis, 
assuming a circular orbit, 
means omega o relative 
to n is simply a constant, 
mean orbit rate cross 
axis orbit normal axis momentum axis 
whatever you call it, right 
so thats a constant 
orbit rate that we 
rotating so 
many degrees per second 
thats a nominal rotating frame motion, 
we also equilibria is, 
looking conditions 
omega b relative to o go to zero 
that means, if i 
rotating frame that im flying, 
i put craft in here, 
that gyroscopics torques, 
everything dont cause 
change in omega bo 
so we want omega bo time 
derivatives to zero well 
omega bo motion zero 
this must a battery 
okay 
so thats overarching goal, right 
so we orbit frame o, , 
now, we b, , drawn in 
right now, in a general 
orientations attitudes 
so we two parts now, 
attitudes will torque go to zero 
thats one thing that cause 
nonzero accelerations here 
question is, 
attitude will gyroscopic, 
relative to orbit frame, 
that term to vanish well 
so, going to look 
individually 
gravity gradient torque to , 
we said we could certain shapes, 
we could make a cube, 
we could make a sphere 
then, always case, 
kind trivial case 
so lets put that one aside 
going to look 
general inertia tensor case, 
say hey, kind a stage craft, 
i orient 
we found was, long you 
line one three principle axes 
orbit radius, 
that whole torque vector goes to zero 
right 
so if i that without loss in generality 
here, im going to line b o 
easier to line 
could really 
if thats lined up, if you look 
picture, happened, well, 
actually, that comes in next step 
happens is, in o frame, 
inertia tensor space craft, 
seen general orbit frame, 
depending attitude, 
thats going to a general 
three three matrix 
orbit frame typically isnt 
a principal frame spacecraft 
this condition, 
we know that o must a principle frame 
that means diagonal parts 
third axis to 
i still dont know 
rest spacecraft 
this means three axis to 
line gravity vector 
there is an infinity rotations, right, 
that you could rotate that vector 
if you orbit frame, 
if tilted like this, degrees, 
you would a general 
two two inertia tensor 
if lined up, 
like you talking about, david, 
perfectly orbit frame, 
then, would perfectly diagonal 
so, right now, this doesnt require that 
so we get this block diagonal form 
this is illustrated that, 
o is equal to b, theres b b 
third axis is 
lined gravity one 
two axes, i dont know yet 
to do, right 
so, this condition simply makes 
gravity gradient torque go to 
so now, we also want to look this term, 
that cause 
angular accelerations 
so if we make a b definition 
a relative equilibria, we want to stay 
there, we dont want to tumble 
move relative to this orbit frame 
orbit motion is this constant, 
o times o 
accelerations to 
to stay a condition 
now, we plug 
conditions here 
omega bn is omega bo plus omega 
classic stuff that youve done 
so, we combine this 
equilibrium condition, 
plug that gyroscopic term, 
if you this, in one homeworks, 
you actually go this math 
yourself, goes really quickly 
really this utility matrix 
times diagonal inertia, 
times by, hard 
you this this one is n 
in o frame, a lot things vanish 
in end, 
you end this vector 
thats gyroscopic acceleration 
that you get a body 
that zero initial conditions 
so, in cases here, 
spacecraft is twisting 
gyrating relative to orbit frame 
enforcing that equilibrium 
we expect this to zero 
depending attitude youre 
kicking in, gyroscopics might 
give you additional accelerations, 
means an equilibrium, right 
you would a nonzero dots, 
omega dots, in system, so 
we make this to zero 
one option is 
cough 
could you make n go zero 
matt, you think 
n mean 
average rate 
right 
if n goes to zero, wheres 
spacecraft relative to earth 
going straight in 

you get closer to earth, 
happens to that 
yeah, goes faster faster 
so center, 
youve probably reached an infinite speed 
slight challenges that 
except hollywood, hollywood 
inaudible movies inaudible travel 
yeah thats inaudible 
hollywood makes work, 
rest us so lucky 
if n goes to , 
orbits are, 
slower orbital rates go 
to make go to you 
to infinitely far 
so youre really in orbit anymore 
so making this is really 
a practical thing 
thing we is, 
we say this term 
now, that mean 
i want to go back to this block 
diagonal form that we 
keep in mind, this is inertia tensor, 
we typically always write 
in body frame 
key thing to realize in this 
following analysis is, this is always 
written relative to orbit frame 
that means, 
i is inertia o part 
i is spacecraft inertia 
o axis, is o 
and, if you certain angles, you may 
cross coupling inertia, right 
now, making terms go to 
that mean now, david 
about, to a gravity 
gradient relatively equilibria 
orientation must we 
that body frames 
align frame 
yep 
that means, basically mathematically, 
result we get 
this stuff happens if inertia 
tends to description, seen 
that rotating orbit frame, 
a constantly rotating orbit frame here 
to a diagonal form, 
thats way this is going to work 
so earlier statement is right 
an equilibria, we need three 
principal axes to actually line 
theres still finite permutations, 
you could b line , 
, , , , , right 
different permutations to 
keep a right handed frame 
theres one answer 
thats saying, 
look craft, could this way, 
could this way 
if im flying this way, 
i could flip this way 
i cant fly 
a skewed angle, right 
axes to line a long 
track, vertical cross track 
thats this condition means, 
thats we found here 
so thats result, 
this is requirement 
gravity grading torque to zero 
this is requirement 
relative equilibria 
yes sir 
so congruent that inaudible 
cylindrical spacecraft inaudible 
yes 
you could 
you could 
good 
right 
so now, 
different combinations this, 
if you a cylindrical spacecraft, 
you line one axes, 
two axes, theres an ambiguity 
is principle is saying 
so you could make cylindrical, 
if mission allows it, 
you want to exploit gravity gradients, 
thats a great thing 
often, structures people issues 
solar panels sizes, 
dont want to make cylindrical 
darn structures people 
but, dynamics point view, 
yes, that would actually make easier 
also actually loses any, 
you will look later, 
well see three axis 
controls that happens 
if you make cylindrical, a downside is, 
if i a three dimensional shape, 
i look 
if anything is perturbed around 
axes, will stable 
that means angular 
departures dont grow 
if i given a little bit twist 
theres something gyroscopically 
bringing that 
if you make a cylinder, 
we will lose that 
a sudden, 
symmetry there never would 
a restoring force that access
