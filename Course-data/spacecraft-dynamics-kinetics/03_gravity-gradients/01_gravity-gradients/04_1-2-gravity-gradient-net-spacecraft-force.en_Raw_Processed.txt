we ways to get torque to zero either shape make go to zero 
shape particular orientations if we locked one principal axis and, 
you know, be, make equal position vector 
so weve identified is if you look this equation, 
if you a circular orbit , kilometers 
a circular orbit , kilometers leo versus geo, youre 
going to get different gravity gradient torques kind makes sense, right 
you go weaker gravity gets, 
that we could effect gravity gradients becomes well 
so you change orbits, 
actually affects attitude, you get different torques acting 
so is inverse true 
thats we want to study here 
so if you take spacecraft pointing sun 
you decide to rotate reaction wheels point earth, 
youve taken this finite mass moved this distribution around 
since orbits affect attitude, attitudes affect orbits 
if different orientations, i change orbit type 
answer is yes 
you 
important question is you care 
big is that term 
so going to step this math a little bit quicker 
i stuff, kind principles, 
youll see would to go to second order expansions that set first 
first order expansions actually vanish 
you get this expression im going to rewrite 
so now, you get gravity force much precisely assuming 
a point mass, a finite shape 
now, orientation couples 
is mass 
you mass lined close to earth versus mass lined, you know, 
lined evenly away earth 
that means different gravitational accelerations 
you different orbits 
so lets go math 
blob, force, 
instead a body integral r across four step, 
gave us torques center mass we want net force acting this body 
so we treat body in a roll little dn forces 
that going to 
so we dropped r cross parts 
so several terms youll see will similar 
thats im kind going this quicker 
we to in end, you plug in stuff like 
very, similar 
you dont that r cross term we to an expansion 
one r cubed, thats rc plus little r, 
im keeping first order term, we 
twos would cancel, in that case 
theres also a second order term here here, 
end critical because, again, first order vanishes 
you plug this in, manipulate 
similar arguments before, we see body integrals here, 
center mass makes that vanish, center mass will make this vanish 
we terms 
this is one we expanded earlier vector crossproduct identities 
that ended inertia tensor plus something 
relative, parallel to rc cancel we cross rc, 
here crossing stuff so going to a little bit different 
thats going to total mass 
this screams vector identities because, 
thats going to r squared 
will give us a polar moment inertia stuff 
so we apply, again, identity we used earlier, plug this stuff in, right 
process you start to identify, ah, look this minus sign 
that becomes inertia tensor 
this too, we relate to inertia tensors 
r squares bodying r squares actually polar moments inertia 
thats defined here 
this is something im giving you 
you look this a classic statics mechanics book, 
polar moment is thing one half trace stuff 
you actually prove this to pretty quickly 
if you look i matrix, diagonals x square plus y square 
y square plus z square x square plus z square 
you start adding 
you basically get two times x square y square c square 
x square y square, c square, is always little r squared 
so thats youve proven it, right 
thats thing 
so i go inertia tensor, get trace that half 
im also going to start factoring rcs here 
if i divide rc magnitude, i get unit direction vectors 
will a nice convenient form, 
i to factor an extra rc squared there 
so math steps 
a lot extra details lets see we get 
we use inertia tensor definition 
in end this is precise gravity force an orbit 
right 
if you look this, this is, 
in orbits class you tend to deal gravity accelerations 
r dot is equal to minus you ever cube times r 
that classic orbit equation here 
getting to in terms force everything is multiplied times m 
basically 
so you got minus mu rc cubed times rc, right, that one here 
thats point mass approximation 
thats about, that orbits class 
then, first order terms dropped 
we left afterwards second order terms, 
every one able to write somehow is a function inertia tensor, 
is kind cool i factor things 
so, this unit direction vectors extra rc squares that i to factor 
so now, this is formulation 
so you see, you change attitude, 
a sudden you will different results you a small impact orbit 
so if you fly, flying this way you go this way, 
you will a slightly different orbit 
earth, manmade spacecraft earth 
this is a really, really small effect 
if you start flying around small asteroids boulders, this may a small effect 
right 
this is stuff you to actually account you extra expansions 
classic point mass model is going to work necessarily 
so in this class asteroids, 
so going to look this quickly dimensional analysis 
inertias mass spacecraft times distance squared every element 
kind large, good opera estimate make a sphere 
radii, mass, is far you 
we dont build spacecraft that way, that would kind an upper bound 
so mass times radius spacecraft squared divided 
mass times radius orbit squared, masses cancel 
so need to look ratios spacecraft squared to radius orbit squared 
orbits, lets make leo easy , kilometers squared million kilometers thats , 
times to 
so to ish order meters 
manmade objects 
around oneish average radius 
if look mass distribution everything 
so this term is one, plus something, one to 
thats pretty small 
youre going to to account for, you know, lawrence forces, drag forces, 
origin pressure forces, gassing forces probably material 
theres disturbances that way bigger to minus 
you know, j that you talking to minus three j four 
five six is, okay, maybe, 
there three, two, three orders magnitude smaller 
right 
still that level, nowhere near to minus 
so earth application thats typically you dont see this, 
is there tools you develop 
again, getting pretty cool missions around small bodies, 
trying to get around boulders flying stuff crafts might be, you know, 
this might much a significant effect 
asteroids still tend to basically lumps stuff 
we dont build spacecraft cannonballs lumps stuff 
this spacecraft lots empty space, right 
so inertia ratios still going to big, might still quite small, 
might negligible either 
so kind a cool result people, good prelim questions, you know 
attitude affect orbit 
answer is yes 
always, spencer 
still a little confused to like small asteroid, like uneven bodies like that, 
gravity gradient work a factor 
isnt 
use a metrical force 
force 
proportionately a bigger influence, this big square bracketed term 
basically normalized to point mass approximation that object is one 
much is this going to 
so you to look at, well whats inertia 
if still size one, meterish 
you know size spacecraft this isnt million meters, 
a sudden meters, 
youre flying around five meter boulder, you i mean 
still going to small, to minus small, right 
then, theres bigger binary systems kind stuff people studying 
definitely makes an effect 
theres binary asteroid systems, you have, 
you know, shears done a lot work this stuff 
hes got a whole book this 
then, affects 
that makes sense 
so good 
so weve covered to derive gravity gradients, we need that one approximation 
that spacecraft is small compared to orbit 
we got nice vectorial way to write in different coordinate frame versions 
this is force version 
this is fy, so you see answer
