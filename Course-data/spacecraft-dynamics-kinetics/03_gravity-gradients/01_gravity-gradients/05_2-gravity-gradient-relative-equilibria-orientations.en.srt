1
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:10,908
Next thing you want to do is now that we
have a model of gravity gradient torque,

2
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:13,162
we want to talk about equilibrium.

3
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,520
And in this application, I have
the word relative equilibrium state.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,262
We talked about equilibria simply meaning,
if we have x dot equal to f as a dynamical

5
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:26,081
system, equilibrium means at what
states x is x dot going to be zero?

6
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,510
All right, that's it.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,110
And then, those are fixed points in
your states phase or flows phase,

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,210
whatever you might want to call it.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,420
A relative equilibrium
means we're not looking for

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,870
stuff where the spacecraft rotation
relative to the inertial is constant.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,810
But actually,
it's relative to a rotating frame.

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,530
And what you typically have in orbits is,

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,720
we care about the motion of a spacecraft
as seen by a rotating orbit frame.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,990
We have a frame that line,
one axis lines up with orbit radial,

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,490
the old frame is an old radial, alright?

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,160
One is the long track,
one is a cross track stuff.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,170
That's a rotating orbit frame.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,120
And we often care,

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,017
if I'm flying to space station like that,
always pointing at the Earth, I'm actually

20
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:10,050
interested in the motion of the space
station, relative to this orbit frame.

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,130
How does gravity, torques and
everything and gyroscopics effect that?

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,640
So we're going to look at
relative equilibrias here.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,295
The equations of motion is the same.

24
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:22,103
It's a rigid body, we derived it
with b relative to n, still, right?

25
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:25,855
And then this is the gravity gradient
torque which we just derive.

26
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:29,325
We can now plug that in in different
forms and do stuff with it.

27
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:32,955
And omega BN is the angular motion of

28
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:37,780
B relative to the orbit frame
plus the orbit frame motion.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,130
In this analysis,
we're assuming a circular orbit,

30
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,095
which means omega o relative
to n is simply a constant,

31
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:50,920
it's your mean orbit rate about your cross
axis or orbit normal axis momentum axis.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,070
Whatever you call it, right.

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,950
So that's just a constant
orbit rate that we have.

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,770
We're rotating at so
many degrees per second.

35
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,630
That's a nominal rotating frame motion,
but what we also have with equilibria is,

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,050
we're looking for conditions where
omega B relative to O go to zero.

37
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,080
That means, if I have my
rotating frame that I'm flying,

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,789
how can I put my craft in here,
such that gyroscopics and torques, and

39
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:21,020
everything don't cause
any change in omega BO.

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,400
So we want omega BO time
derivatives to be zero as well.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,670
And omega BO the motion should be zero.

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,250
This must not have a battery.

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,160
Okay.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,750
So that's the overarching goal, right?

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,660
So we have the orbit frame o1, 2, and 3.

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,030
And now, we have b1, 2, and 3 drawn in.

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,270
And right now, it's in a general
orientations for what attitudes.

48
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:49,490
So we have two parts now, for
what attitudes will my torque go to zero?

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,530
That's one thing that can cause
non-zero accelerations here.

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,180
And the other question is, for
what attitude will my gyroscopic,

51
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,310
relative to the orbit frame,
that term has to vanish as well.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,610
And so, we're going to look
at both of them individually.

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,680
For the gravity gradient torque to be 0,
we said we could have certain shapes,

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
we could make it a cube,
we could make it a sphere.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,840
Then, as always the case,
as kind of the trivial case.

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,530
So let's put that one aside.

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,510
Now we're going to look at the more
general inertia tensor case, and

58
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,080
say hey, with kind of a stage craft,
how do I orient it?

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,230
And what we found was, as long as you
line up one of your three principle axes

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,720
with the orbit radius,
that whole torque vector goes to zero.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,900
All right.

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,500
So if I do that without loss in generality
here, I'm going to line up B3 with O3.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,230
It's just easier to line up.

64
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,750
It could be really be any of them.

65
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,850
And if that's lined up, if you look
at the picture, what happened, well,

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,860
actually, that comes in the next step.

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,782
What happens then is, in the O frame,
my inertia tensor of the space craft, and

68
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:55,040
as seen by general orbit frame,
depending how the attitude,

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,930
that's going to be a general
three by three matrix.

70
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,820
The orbit frame typically isn't
a principal frame of your spacecraft.

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,240
But because of this condition,
we know that O3 must be a principle frame.

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,910
That means the off diagonal parts
with the third axis have to all be 0.

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,520
But I still don't know what
the rest of the spacecraft does.

74
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,810
This means the three axis has to
line up with my gravity vector but

75
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,730
there is an infinity of rotations, right,
that you could rotate about that vector.

76
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,030
And if you have your orbit frame,
if it's tilted like this, 45 degrees,

77
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,820
you would have a general
two by two inertia tensor.

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,040
It's only if it's lined up,
like you were talking about, David,

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,890
perfectly with the orbit frame,
then, it would be perfectly diagonal.

80
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,690
So, right now, this doesn't require that.

81
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,540
So we get this block diagonal form.

82
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:51,300
And this is now how they illustrated that,
O3 is equal to B3, but there's B1 and B2.

83
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,460
Just because my third axis is
lined up with gravity my one and

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,330
two axes, I don't know yet
what they have to do, right?

85
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,610
So, this condition simply makes my
gravity gradient torque go to 0.

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,500
So now, we also want to look at this term,

87
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,790
because that can cause
angular accelerations.

88
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,420
So if we make a B/0 by definition of being
a relative equilibria, we want to stay

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,650
there, we don't want to tumble and
move relative to this orbit frame.

90
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,960
The orbit motion itself is this constant,
O times O2.

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,360
All these accelerations have to
be 0 to stay at such a condition.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,390
Now, we can plug these
conditions into here.

93
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,270
Omega B/N is Omega B/O plus Omega O/N.

94
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,950
Classic stuff that you've done.

95
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,890
And so, we can combine this
at the equilibrium condition,

96
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,070
plug it into that gyroscopic term, and
if you do this, in one of your homeworks,

97
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,500
you actually go through this math
yourself, it goes really quickly.

98
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,620
It's really this utility matrix
times the diagonal inertia,

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,010
times the 3-by-1, not very hard.

100
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:04,460
You do this because this one is only 0 n
0 in the O frame, a lot of things vanish.

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,260
And in the end,
you end up with this vector.

102
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,900
That's your gyroscopic acceleration
that you get from a body

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,540
that had zero initial conditions.

104
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,420
So, in all cases here,
the spacecraft is not twisting and

105
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,730
gyrating relative to the orbit frame.

106
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,770
We're enforcing that at the equilibrium
we expect this to be zero.

107
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,210
But depending on the attitude you're
kicking in, the gyroscopics might

108
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,880
give you additional accelerations, which
means it's not an equilibrium, right?

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,320
You would now have a non-zero dots,
omega dots, in the system, so

110
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,080
how can we make this to zero?

111
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,670
One option is
>> [COUGH]

112
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,000
>> could you make N go zero?

113
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,300
Matt, what do you think?

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,080
What does N mean again?

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
>> The average rate.

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,950
>> Right.

117
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,006
If N goes to zero, where's your
spacecraft relative to the earth?

118
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:58,997
>> Going straight in.

119
00:06:58,997 --> 00:06:59,670
>> No.

120
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,944
As you get closer to the earth,
what happens to that?

121
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeah, it goes faster and faster.

122
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,260
So at the center,
you've probably reached an infinite speed.

123
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,960
Slight challenges with that.

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,420
Except for Hollywood, Hollywood
[INAUDIBLE] movies [INAUDIBLE] travel.

125
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,350
Yeah that's not [INAUDIBLE]
Hollywood makes it work, but

126
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,750
for the rest of us not so lucky.

127
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,000
If your n goes to 0,

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,580
the further out your orbits are,
the slower your orbital rates go.

129
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,890
And to make it go to 0 you
have to be infinitely far out.

130
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,030
So you're really not in orbit anymore.

131
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,660
So making this 0 is really
not a practical thing.

132
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,960
The other thing we can do is,
we can say this term can be 0.

133
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Now, what does that mean?

134
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,380
I want to go back to this block
diagonal form that we had.

135
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,540
Keep in mind, this is the inertia tensor,

136
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,200
we typically always write
it in the body frame.

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,990
The key thing to realize in this and

138
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,590
the following analysis is, this is always
written relative to the orbit frame.

139
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,230
That means,
I3 is the inertia about the O3 part.

140
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:01,050
I1 is the spacecraft inertia about
the O1 axis, and I22's about the O2.

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,990
And, if you have certain angles, you may
have some cross coupling inertia, right?

142
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,110
Now, we're making these terms go to 0.

143
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,050
What does that mean now, David?

144
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,280
About, to be at a gravity
gradient relatively equilibria?

145
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,730
What orientation must we have?

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,020
>> That the body frames
align with the other frame.

147
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,880
>> Yep.

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,510
That means, basically mathematically,
the result we get.

149
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,130
This stuff only happens if the inertia
tends to description, as seen by

150
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,290
that rotating orbit frame, and it's
a constantly rotating orbit frame here.

151
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,550
It has to be a diagonal form,
that's the only way this is going to work.

152
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,350
So your earlier statement is right.

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,670
For an equilibria, we do need all three
principal axes to actually line up.

154
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:49,645
There's still finite permutations,
you could have B1 line up with +03,

155
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:53,915
-03, +02, -02, +01, -01, right.

156
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,964
And then different permutations to
keep it as a right handed frame.

157
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,691
But there's more than just one answer.

158
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:01,224
That's the same as saying,
look at the craft, it could be this way,

159
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:02,690
it could be this way.

160
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,120
If I'm flying this way,
I could flip it this way.

161
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
I just can't have it fly
at a skewed angle, right?

162
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,890
The axes have to line up with a long
track, both for vertical and cross track.

163
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,129
That's what this condition means,
and that's what we found here.

164
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
So that's the result,
this is not the requirement for

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,100
gravity grading torque to be zero.

166
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,906
This is the requirement for
these relative equilibria.

167
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:27,436
Yes sir?

168
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:31,444
>> So congruent that [INAUDIBLE]

169
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:36,793
cylindrical spacecraft [INAUDIBLE]?

170
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,050
>> Yes.
You could.

171
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,770
You could.
Very good.

172
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,480
All right.

173
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
So now,
the different combinations of this,

174
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,440
if you have a cylindrical spacecraft,
you line up one of these axes,

175
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,660
the other two axes, there's an ambiguity
on what is the principle is saying.

176
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,169
So you could make it cylindrical,
if your mission allows it, and

177
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,960
you want to exploit gravity gradients,
that's a great thing.

178
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Often, structures people have issues
with solar panels and sizes, and

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,110
they don't want to make it cylindrical and
darn structures people.

180
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,680
But, from the dynamics point of view,
yes, that would actually make it easier.

181
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,820
But it also actually loses any,
you will look later,

182
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,600
we'll see three axis
controls that happens.

183
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,870
If you make it cylindrical, a downside is,

184
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,850
if I have a three dimensional shape,
I can look at it.

185
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,780
And if anything is perturbed around
any of the axes, it will be stable.

186
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,700
That means these angular
departures don't just grow.

187
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,290
If I given a little bit of twist
there's something gyroscopically

188
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,970
bringing that again.

189
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,890
If you make it a cylinder,
we will lose that.

190
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,324
because then all of a sudden,

191
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:40,064
because of the symmetry there never would
be a restoring force about that access.
