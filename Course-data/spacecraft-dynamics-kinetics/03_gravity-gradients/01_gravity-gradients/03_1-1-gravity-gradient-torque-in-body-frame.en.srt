1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,000
So good.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,940
This is the vector form,
the coordinate independent form.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,481
Let's now actually apply
some particular frames and

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,970
there's different answers
that we get out of this.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,323
It's always the same answer,
but it's different expressions,

6
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:19,260
different formulations
of that same answer.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,280
So if I'm using an orbit frame, and
here I've used an aircraft-like frame,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,730
where if an airplane is flying you have
your nose pointing in the one direction,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,880
your wings may be to the left or right.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,080
I have yaw axis up,
aircraft probably would have had it down.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,940
But with orbits we tend
to have our third axis or

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,300
one of the axis up in
the radial direction.

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,220
So, 01 is my long track,
02 is my cross track orbit normal, and

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,865
03 is my orbit radius direction vector.

15
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,770
They're all unit direction vectors.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,765
That means Rc by definition is always
going to be 7,000 kilometers in that

17
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,413
direction, all right?

18
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,717
And that direction is defined here by 03.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,880
So, in the O frame, your position vector
on a circular orbit in particular,

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,430
is just going to be constant.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,540
It's just going to be 0, 0, Rc,
all right, which is kind of nice.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,190
So we can write that.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,770
But we've seen the spacecraft part,
the inertia tensor,

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,630
we tend to write in the body frame.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,024
So while the orbit positions could
be written in very simple manners,

26
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,180
we tend to need it in the body frame.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,453
And now, so if this is your position
vector pointing up to your satellite, and

28
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:34,054
you've got a coordinate frame on your
satellite, depending on your orientation,

29
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:38,006
you can have an infinity of different
variations, and most generally,

30
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:42,089
you're going to have to account for
three different vector components, for

31
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:45,140
your Rc inertial position vector, always.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,980
So, Rc 1, 2, 3, nothing but

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,110
B frame components of my position vector,
different ways to look at it.

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,510
So we have that.

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,190
Now we plug this in,
I added these this morning.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,389
Everything's in the body frame
just to make it explicit.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,781
So we had Rc, cross I Rc.

38
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:04,883
I've picked a principal coordinate
frame here just to make,

39
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,340
I can always do that for
a rigid body, all right.

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,910
It exists, it makes your
analysis a little bit easier.

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,880
Now you can do this math,
this multiplication is what talking about.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,358
You get a little bit of scaling,
then the cross product, and

43
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:18,160
this is going to be your answer.

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,540
So this box, the answer's the same
as the earlier one after it's

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,290
expressed everything now
in body frame components.

46
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,723
But we can again look at
more conditions now and

47
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:36,100
try to figure out when will the gravity
gradient torque go to zero?

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,510
Why do I care about it going to zero?

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,803
For equilibrious that
we're about to study,

50
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:44,272
that's thing if you have these conditions
and this is the one disturbance you're

51
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:48,180
modeling, if that disturbance acts on it,
you won't be at an equilibrious.

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,600
This is like gravity gradients
we talked about last time.

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,550
This would be a gravity
gradient equilibria.

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,250
If you disturb it, then,

55
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,270
this one weigh more than this
point makes it restore itself.

56
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,250
So what orientations or
what shapes give us that?

57
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,030
And as you guys mentioned earlier,
one way to make these things go to zero

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,480
is simply these differences
all have to vanish.

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,120
And that means, as you guys already
identified, is that all the principal

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,910
inertias must be equal which is either
a sphere or a cube, those kinds of shapes.

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,910
So, there are particular shapes that
can make your attitude go to 0.

62
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,170
That's not or so
your gravity gradient torque go to 0.

63
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,090
And that's important, there was a
satellite that we built here called Dandy.

64
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,068
Anybody know that one?

65
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,710
Heard about it a little bit, right?

66
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,598
It was a sphere for reason like that so
we could do this stuff, and

67
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,185
didn't have any other gravity gradient
torques disturbing because I really wanted

68
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,167
to measure atmospheric force effects, and

69
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,920
I didn't need all the disturbances
acting on it very much.

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,464
So that was really leading to this
decision, all right, that gave us zero

71
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:52,780
gravity gradient torques,
also how the atmospheric drag effects so

72
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,460
you didn't have weird panels sticking out,
there were other reasons too.

73
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,090
So the other way we can make it go to
zero is we can look at these components.

74
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,530
Are there particular orientations?

75
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,405
Remember, Rc one and two and three,

76
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,371
the position vector always
points to straight outward but

77
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:13,566
then depending on my attitude, I will
have different Rc 1, 2, 3 components.

78
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:19,370
Are there different orientations that
will force this LG to go to zero?

79
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,520
And the answer I'm showing you
is Rc is equal to Rc times bi.

80
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,060
So, is it David?

81
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,140
What does that mean for your orientation,
if Rc is equal to Rc bi hat?

82
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,440
>> Does it mean you're aligning your body
axis with the O frame that you created?

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,348
>> Be more specific,
what part of the O frame?

84
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,080
>> The radius vector.

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,930
>> Right, because if you say you're adding
a body axis relative to the O frame-

86
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,373
>> If they're principal inertia axis?

87
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:56,280
>> Then that implies all
my principal inertia axis

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,190
have to line up with the O frame,
and that's not true.

89
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,081
So your second argument is correct, and

90
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:09,350
it's what we really care about is
the Rc part here that we have, right?

91
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,320
That's in the O3 direction here, it's
basically the orbit to radium to axis.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,220
And so that what it says is your
position vector on that direction has to

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,559
be a principal axis of your body.

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,880
And that could be B1, B2, or B3.

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,360
But it's just locking
one of your R axis in.

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm going to use these to have
three distinct axis, right?

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,010
So we have, this is a principal axis,
this is a principal axis, and

98
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,650
this is a principal axis.

99
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,840
It just says that if I line up one
of those things as a principal axis.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,540
Let's do the simple example, right?

101
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,840
Here I have my skinny axis
in the vertical direction.

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,310
That satisfies that condition.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,310
If I rotate about that axis,

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,290
this is still in equilibrium, because
of the symmetry of the stuff, right?

105
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,560
So you can see,
that orientation doesn't matter.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,400
It just matters that one of
the principal axes is lined up.

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,940
This is another one that we identified,

108
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,200
where right now the gravity gradients
are even and they cancelled each other.

109
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,190
But I can rotate about that
about the gravity direction.

110
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,750
And I still have a zero gravity
gradient torque, right?

111
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,420
That's what this condition means.

112
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,520
So it only locks one of my body axis to be
aligned with the orbit direction vector.

113
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,800
That's it.

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,260
But it still leaves an infinity of
orientations because you can rotate about

115
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,340
that local vertical axis.

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,965
Okay, good, yes?

117
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:38,750
>> [INAUDIBLE]

118
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,578
>> Thinking more like J2 and that stuff?

119
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:44,150
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> They're pretty small.

120
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,280
J2 is about a thousand times
smaller than the regular stuff.

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,860
So if you care about those accuracies, you
could do that and you'd have to account

122
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,790
for that then in these developments,
that would be actual terms.

123
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,129
I don't typically see those because
this is already a pretty small torque.

124
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,610
Many simulations don't even include this,
but if you do include it, great,

125
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,440
and J2 is much, much smaller.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,080
If you're going around asteroids,
that's a whole different problem.

127
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,440
If you're looking at
an asteroid binary system,

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,570
I know some of you this year
might be looking at those.

129
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,870
That's a full on thing.

130
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,670
Then you do these expansions
like I've done but

131
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,680
on two bodies not just treating the Earth
as a big point mass, as a big thing.

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,050
But for Earth, it is very spherical
as far as that goes, right?

133
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
But yep, no, great question.

134
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,710
So, this would be modified.

135
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,485
The process is the same, but you might
have extra conditions to line it up with

136
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,530
the local area, and what does that mean?
