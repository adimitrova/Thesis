so
good
.
this
is
the
vector
form
,
the
coordinate
independent
form
.
let
's
now
actually
apply
some
particular
frames
and
there
's
different
answers
that
we
get
out
of
this
.
it
's
always
the
same
answer
,
but
it
's
different
expressions
,
different
formulations
of
that
same
answer
.
so
if
i
'm
using
an
orbit
frame
,
and
here
i
've
used
an
aircraft-like
frame
,
where
if
an
airplane
is
flying
you
have
your
nose
pointing
in
the
one
direction
,
your
wings
may
be
to
the
left
or
right
.
i
have
yaw
axis
up
,
aircraft
probably
would
have
had
it
down
.
but
with
orbits
we
tend
to
have
our
third
axis
or
one
of
the
axis
up
in
the
radial
direction
.
so
,
01
is
my
long
track
,
02
is
my
cross
track
orbit
normal
,
and
03
is
my
orbit
radius
direction
vector
.
they
're
all
unit
direction
vectors
.
that
means
rc
by
definition
is
always
going
to
be
7,000
kilometers
in
that
direction
,
all
right
?
and
that
direction
is
defined
here
by
03.
so
,
in
the
o
frame
,
your
position
vector
on
a
circular
orbit
in
particular
,
is
just
going
to
be
constant
.
it
's
just
going
to
be
0
,
0
,
rc
,
all
right
,
which
is
kind
of
nice
.
so
we
can
write
that
.
but
we
've
seen
the
spacecraft
part
,
the
inertia
tensor
,
we
tend
to
write
in
the
body
frame
.
so
while
the
orbit
positions
could
be
written
in
very
simple
manners
,
we
tend
to
need
it
in
the
body
frame
.
and
now
,
so
if
this
is
your
position
vector
pointing
up
to
your
satellite
,
and
you
've
got
a
coordinate
frame
on
your
satellite
,
depending
on
your
orientation
,
you
can
have
an
infinity
of
different
variations
,
and
most
generally
,
you
're
going
to
have
to
account
for
three
different
vector
components
,
for
your
rc
inertial
position
vector
,
always
.
so
,
rc
1
,
2
,
3
,
nothing
but
b
frame
components
of
my
position
vector
,
different
ways
to
look
at
it
.
so
we
have
that
.
now
we
plug
this
in
,
i
added
these
this
morning
.
everything
's
in
the
body
frame
just
to
make
it
explicit
.
so
we
had
rc
,
cross
i
rc
.
i
've
picked
a
principal
coordinate
frame
here
just
to
make
,
i
can
always
do
that
for
a
rigid
body
,
all
right
.
it
exists
,
it
makes
your
analysis
a
little
bit
easier
.
now
you
can
do
this
math
,
this
multiplication
is
what
talking
about
.
you
get
a
little
bit
of
scaling
,
then
the
cross
product
,
and
this
is
going
to
be
your
answer
.
so
this
box
,
the
answer
's
the
same
as
the
earlier
one
after
it
's
expressed
everything
now
in
body
frame
components
.
but
we
can
again
look
at
more
conditions
now
and
try
to
figure
out
when
will
the
gravity
gradient
torque
go
to
zero
?
why
do
i
care
about
it
going
to
zero
?
for
equilibrious
that
we
're
about
to
study
,
that
's
thing
if
you
have
these
conditions
and
this
is
the
one
disturbance
you
're
modeling
,
if
that
disturbance
acts
on
it
,
you
wo
n't
be
at
an
equilibrious
.
this
is
like
gravity
gradients
we
talked
about
last
time
.
this
would
be
a
gravity
gradient
equilibria
.
if
you
disturb
it
,
then
,
this
one
weigh
more
than
this
point
makes
it
restore
itself
.
so
what
orientations
or
what
shapes
give
us
that
?
and
as
you
guys
mentioned
earlier
,
one
way
to
make
these
things
go
to
zero
is
simply
these
differences
all
have
to
vanish
.
and
that
means
,
as
you
guys
already
identified
,
is
that
all
the
principal
inertias
must
be
equal
which
is
either
a
sphere
or
a
cube
,
those
kinds
of
shapes
.
so
,
there
are
particular
shapes
that
can
make
your
attitude
go
to
0.
that
's
not
or
so
your
gravity
gradient
torque
go
to
0.
and
that
's
important
,
there
was
a
satellite
that
we
built
here
called
dandy
.
anybody
know
that
one
?
heard
about
it
a
little
bit
,
right
?
it
was
a
sphere
for
reason
like
that
so
we
could
do
this
stuff
,
and
did
n't
have
any
other
gravity
gradient
torques
disturbing
because
i
really
wanted
to
measure
atmospheric
force
effects
,
and
i
did
n't
need
all
the
disturbances
acting
on
it
very
much
.
so
that
was
really
leading
to
this
decision
,
all
right
,
that
gave
us
zero
gravity
gradient
torques
,
also
how
the
atmospheric
drag
effects
so
you
did
n't
have
weird
panels
sticking
out
,
there
were
other
reasons
too
.
so
the
other
way
we
can
make
it
go
to
zero
is
we
can
look
at
these
components
.
are
there
particular
orientations
?
remember
,
rc
one
and
two
and
three
,
the
position
vector
always
points
to
straight
outward
but
then
depending
on
my
attitude
,
i
will
have
different
rc
1
,
2
,
3
components
.
are
there
different
orientations
that
will
force
this
lg
to
go
to
zero
?
and
the
answer
i
'm
showing
you
is
rc
is
equal
to
rc
times
bi
.
so
,
is
it
david
?
what
does
that
mean
for
your
orientation
,
if
rc
is
equal
to
rc
bi
hat
?

does
it
mean
you
're
aligning
your
body

with
the
o
frame

you
created

,
because
if

then
that
implies
all
my
principal
inertia
axis
have
to
line
up
with
the
o
frame
,
and
that
's
not
true
.
so
your
second
argument
is
correct
,
and
it
's
what
we
really
care
about
is
the
rc
part
here
that
we
have
,
right
?
that
's
in
the
o3
direction
here
,
it
's
basically
the
orbit
to
radium
to
axis
.
and
so
that
what
it
says
is
your
position
vector
on
that
direction
has
to
be
a
principal
axis
of
your
body
.
and
that
could
be
b1
,
b2
,
or
b3
.
but
it
's
just
locking
one
of
your
r
axis
in
.
i
'm
going
to
use
these
to
have
three
distinct
axis
,
right
?
so
we
have
,
this
is
a
principal
axis
,
this
is
a
principal
axis
,
and
this
is
a
principal
axis
.
it
just
says
that
if
i
line
up
one
of
those
things
as
a
principal
axis
.
let
's
do
the
simple
example
,
right
?
here
i
have
my
skinny
axis
in
the
vertical
direction
.
that
satisfies
that
condition
.
if
i
rotate
about
that
axis
,
this
is
still
in
equilibrium
,
because
of
the
symmetry
of
the
stuff
,
right
?
so
you
can
see
,
that
orientation
does
n't
matter
.
it
just
matters
that
one
of
the
principal
axes
is
lined
up
.
this
is
another
one
that
we
identified
,
where
right
now
the
gravity
gradients
are
even
and
they
cancelled
each
other
.
but
i
can
rotate
about
that
about
the
gravity
direction
.
and
i
still
have
a
zero
gravity
gradient
torque
,
right
?
that
's
what
this
condition
means
.
so
it
only
locks
one
of
my
body
axis
to
be
aligned
with
the
orbit
direction
vector
.
that
's
it
.
but
it
still
leaves
an
infinity
of
orientations
because
you
can
rotate
about
that
local
vertical
axis
.
okay
,
good
,
yes
?

[

thinking
more
like
j2
and
that

they
're
pretty
small
.
j2
is
about
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
the
regular
stuff
.
so
if
you
care
about
those
accuracies
,
you
could
do
that
and
you
'd
have
to
account
for
that
then
in
these
developments
,
that
would
be
actual
terms
.
i
do
n't
typically
see
those
because
this
is
already
a
pretty
small
torque
.
many
simulations
do
n't
even
include
this
,
but
if
you
do
include
it
,
great
,
and
j2
is
much
,
much
smaller
.
if
you
're
going
around
asteroids
,
that
's
a
whole
different
problem
.
if
you
're
looking
at
an
asteroid
binary
system
,
i
know
some
of
you
this
year
might
be
looking
at
those
.
that
's
a
full
on
thing
.
then
you
do
these
expansions
like
i
've
done
but
on
two
bodies
not
just
treating
the
earth
as
a
big
point
mass
,
as
a
big
thing
.
but
for
earth
,
it
is
very
spherical
as
far
as
that
goes
,
right
?
but
yep
,
no
,
great
question
.
so
,
this
would
be
modified
.
the
process
is
the
same
,
but
you
might
have
extra
conditions
to
line
it
up
with
the
local
area
,
and
what
does
that
mean
?
