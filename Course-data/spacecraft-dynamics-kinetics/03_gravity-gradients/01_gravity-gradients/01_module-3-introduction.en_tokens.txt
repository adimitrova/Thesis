hi
and
welcome
to
the
third
segment
of
spacecraft
kinetics
.
here
,
we
're
going
to
be
studying
in
detail
the
gravity
gradient
,
torque
and
forces
that
happen
on
a
rigid
spacecraft
.
so
with
the
spacecraft
,
every
part
of
the
mass
distribution
is
a
different
distance
away
from
the
center
of
the
earth
.
that
means
it
's
experiencing
a
different
gravitational
force
.
now
,
we
have
to
sum
it
up
over
a
whole
body
.
so
in
particular
of
interest
to
us
is
if
you
have
the
gravity
gradient
that
you
've
computed
,
which
orientations
of
a
craft
caused
the
gravity
gradient
to
be
zero
.
and
when
we
're
moving
in
a
rotating
frame
,
which
one
of
these
are
now
relative
equilibrious
will
be
developing
all
of
those
and
then
there
's
some
interesting
examples
.
you
can
look
at
which
one
of
those
is
stable
.
look
at
a
tall
slender
object
,
the
lower
object
weighs
more
has
a
stronger
gravity
force
than
the
top
part
.
so
if
you
disturb
the
attitude
,
this
would
help
stabilize
it
.
we
'll
begin
to
study
such
configuration
for
full
3d
.
this
is
a
very
useful
topic
.
there
's
many
satellites
of
gravity
being
stabilized
or
there
are
big
things
like
the
space
station
.
gravity
gradients
definitely
impact
the
attitude
motion
.
so
,
this
section
gives
you
a
good
handle
on
how
to
predict
that
torque
.
