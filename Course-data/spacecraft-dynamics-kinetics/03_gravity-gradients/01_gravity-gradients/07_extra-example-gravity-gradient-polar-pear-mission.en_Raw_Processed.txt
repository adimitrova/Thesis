that math 
linearization everything, 
really boils to a pretty simple 
this is you fly an equilibrium 
weve identified three axis line up, 
three orbit axis to 
principle axis body so 
you line that dictates 
particular orientations 
then, to stable, you to 
make sure this condition is satisfied 
one, if this is stable, 
flying sideways, you know 
so is this one, right 
you could fly nose nose 
you care if youre flying nose 
nose 
depends application 
if shuttle want to use fuel, 
doesnt care 
this spacecraft care 
this is a famous one, 
polar bear mission, 
has, you see gravity 
grating stabilized, need 
laugh need three 
axis to skinnier one, so 
put small mass to save weight 
a thin boom way 
so inertias 
axis going to big, 
big moment arm between 
this mass this honking mass 
along axis, 
thats least inertia 
thats we needed 
stability, right 
go this stuff, 
i, bigger i, bigger i 
life is good, could go wrong 
this craft care that this 
point is looking earth 

thats put sensors 
didnt put this side 
so this launched to gravity 
gradiants stabilize satellite, 
reasonable mass, huge but, 
reasonable mass 
supposed to point this way, 
actually happened 
first period in full sunlight, 
attitude degraded significantly 
basically means shit happened, 
bad stuff happened 
attitude degraded significantly, 
essentially, means inverted 
instead here a little bit 
stable, this whole actually tumbled, 
banded to go there 
you go back shadow, 
everything is good 
we said, this is stable 
so is this 
in this case, we care 
satellite doesnt, 
following physics 
goes, hey, im perfectly happy 
you bump you want 
im stable, im going to stay here 
so like, great 
earth happened 
wasnt supposed to happen 
so, several attempts made 
to reinvent this thing 
finally able to get 
basically to give a kick 
way give a kick 
without using fuel is, despin 
spin wheel to crazy amounts 
is going to apply this huge torque 
needed something to move pass 
this linear local state stable regime 
bigger motion happened 
basically give a kick 
tumbled recovered 
this one 
use wheel to clean 
mess get close 
hopefully stay stable 
so, good news is 
able to recover, 
bad news is even happen 
jordan, you got a question 
inaudible 
we miss here 
assumption you think 
violated space craft 
theres a clue 
first period 
fully sunlit orbit 
happens sunlight 
put in a space craft 
a radiation pressure 
could radiation pressure, 
dont think that cause 
definitely something i would look at, is 
inaudible you a craft 
this huge solar sails basically 
attached that would cause significant 
dont think that cause here, 
definitely related 
spencer 
outgassing 
i think outgassing youve always have, 

causes outgassing in 
sunlight condition you think 
i figured in first fully 
sunlit orbit that would 
outgassed 
going to outgassed initially 
you think a first orbit, 
sunlit 
yeah 
maybe 
again, i dont details this, 
good ideas 
right now, you start to wonder, 
we miss 
whats going here 
happens sunlight, though 
heating 
you heat 
this is a lightweight structure 
heats up, is one side 
happens to side 
happens to heated breath 
i see 
that side will expand inaudible so 
inaudible 
if curving, 
we violate 
rigid 
rigid, this a really, 
really lightweight structure, 
to get this tucker way there 
theres much stiffness to this 
didnt really 
model well thermal deformations that 
happen kinds an orbit 
so there flexing going 
flexing doesnt necessarily 
immediately make go crazy 
this an unlucky mission 
that flexing happened to happening in 
a way 
that able to give 
right kick right time, 
to get one equilibrium 
in end settled, 
settle equilibrium 
perfectly stable, thats trickiness 
gravity gradiants stabilize 
really doesnt care if 
positive negative 
every one equilibriums 
a flip thats still like an equilibrium 
if you care, 
you to a mean to put 
right equilibrium, right 
locally there 
so heres a case a lessons learned, 
thermal deformations 
really matter 
so flex endure, thats 
i heard primary culprit 
ideas fantastic ideas, 
im sure tested every one 
well, make notice 
another bounding case assumption 
even cause this effect right 
to model simulate that 
so, gets tricky
