gravity gradients 
this is kind last big thing in dynamics 
weve looked single rigid body, weve looked that now, you know, torque free, 
a little torque, homework, you know, a little torque 
move dual spinner in rigid body 
thats a way to passively stabilize, theres active feedback control, 
you to make sure you designed right spin rate, so system is stable 
way we passively stabilize system is gravity gradients, right 
this is about, if you look this pen, 
this lower part pen is closer to earth upper part pen 
gravitational acceleration depends one r squared 
so things closer to center earth weigh 
even though mass here here, a stronger force 
that gives you gradient that acts it, right 
theres a gradient across body strong gravity forces 
so, we want to look gradients general objects 
figure forces, torques, 
equilibriums, stabilities 
again, classic things that we dualspinner, 
getting torques though is a little bit interesting 
so, gravity gradients tend to tall slender 
this is typical gravity gradient kind this configuration 

if this thing is normal condition, 
turns here gravity gradients still give you zero torque 
act, gravity forces act center mass, 
so theres torque center mass 
if i twist it, this one gets pulled stronger this one, 
you get a restoring force, actually helps stabilize 
this will end another gravity gradient everything essentially 
distance center earth 
so youll get force, balance out, theres torque 
if i twist this one slightly, 
this one weighs this one you get a destabilizing effect, right 
so, dualspinner, sometimes equilibriums stable 
sometimes unstable we like to find this way this antisymmetric 
we want to derive is general inertias space shuttle 
a particular orientation flying in a gravity gradient orientation 

that come 
so, tidal forces 
so, going to get to mass flying blobs 
so, going to say, this is a general object 
going to a rigid body in this case, flying jello, 
flying rigid spacecraft 
we typical r, 
thats inertial position vector little infinitesimal mass element, every bolt, 
every screw, every panel, right, accounting 
position, inertially, written position center mass 
spacecraft,plus bolts position relative 
to center mass spacecraft, right 
we earlier 
now, gravity acting this differential element, 
if you look newtons universal law gravity youve got that g, 
mass earth, mass elements, right 
g times n one, n two, n one is earth in n two is dm divided distance squared 
that would this distance times a direction to in minus r direction 
i probably drawn this arrow, this here, that would made sense 
anyway, next time 
thats mathematics, thats newtons gravity law acting a dm particle 
now, we classic definitions 
so going to is going to first look torques, 
gravity gradient torques, center mass 
so, i this point here, i need to get moment arm crossed this force 
thats we torque, right, 
position we applied a force crossed force itself, 
moment, point c 
so, this would easy 
thats little r crossed this df that we 
df is repeated here 
so, we start to plug in substitute stuff 
first step, we put this in here r is rc plus little r 
quickly youll see while theres an r cross rc, a little r cross little r 
that become 
zero, right 
we love zero 
zero is really nice 
zero is friend 
so, immediately this term is going to drop wont contribute to torque 
so, we like that 
we end rc, we take outside integral, 
we argued earlier and, you know, in blobs space 
system every point in that system center mass location 
so impacted this body integral, that leaves you this 
now, r depend, right 
r is rc plus little r, so got little r imbedded 
you cant move that r outside 
this is you end 
now, this is to 
this is rigorous, approximation 
going to is this is r cubed 
thats complications come in 
going to a first order approximation 
r cubed is bloody close to rc cubed, right 
, kilometers center earth, 
looking a half a meter distance 
thats really going to change , kilometers much, right 
very, close, motivates, 
lets take a first order approximation this you get a really good analytical answer 
to gravity gradient torques 
so, we to a linearization, 
essentially im showing here you take this, plug in this stuff 
im a binomial expansion, factor things out, 
in end youre dropping off, 
you to this linearization this term you end this 
this is zeroth order term, one rc cube, 
kind makes sense, minus this times this 
this is first order term, first order here is in terms r, little r, right 
you may done taylor series expansion in terms xs ys zs 
i expect you to a taylor series expansion terms vectorial quantities 
so, im going to this you here 
this is definitely a skill an exam i would expect you to able to 
okay 
let get notes 
quickly 
yeah, that will work 
so, trying to is, we this one term 
thing im trying to expand 
is im treating little r small quantity, right 
rc is big quantity, thats , kilometers to left 
then, i little wiggles plusminus a fraction 
a meter across spacecraft,right 
so little r is a small thing, 
function im trying to approximate is one r cubed, 
is thing r to minus third 
r is a scalar 
r is always defined that way 
so, now, if you look a taylor series expansion, if you f x, 
an expansion xr, x is a scalar in this case, 
you would say taylor says, okay, that is f reference point, 
plus one one, vectorial times, partial f respect to this state 
this partial is evaluated reference times delta x 
delta x would simply x minus xr, right 
you go second order higher 
going to go second order here, right 
thats classic taylor series expansion 
lets apply this here, 
this function depends a vector a scalar 
now, function is a scalar function that makes life a little bit easier 
so, we to figure terms 
so, applying this here going to say f 
r is approximated f reference is f, 
reference is center mass, that means r is equal to zero 
plus, one one factorial, is one one is one, 
times partial f respect to r evaluated reference, 
thats r is equal to zero 
thats center mass location 
everything is center mass times 
instead this is vector dot product small quantity, 
in this case is r 
r is small quantity 
so, expansion r is equal to zero, essentially 
this part, if r is equal to zero r magnitude is equal to rc magnitude, 
thats going to rc to minus third, right 
that ones trivial 
lets look this 
this part we to figure first is partial derivative 
so, if f is r to minus, third partial f respect to little r, 
chain rule, you know, thats going to minus three times r to minus fourth times 
partial radius respect to this little r vector 
so, good 
we get there 
now, we need to find this quantity 
so, to that relationship im going to go back to this stuff 
r squared is really this vector dotted itself, 
is thing rc plus little r dotted rc plus little r, right 
magnitude squared a vector is a dot product vector itself, 
vector is written in terms a song 
so, weve got that, good 
now, i scalars here, this is a scalar end, 
a scalar in terms vectorial quantities vector math 
now, taking derivative this these, partials, 
hopefully you remember to take partial derivatives, left hand side 
im going to get two times r, times partial r respect to little r 
right hand side, if i carry this out, 
i need to take partial derivative of, lets see 
here youre going to rc dotted rc, 
plus two times rc dotted an r, plus little r dotted 
this part doesnt depend little r, so that partial is going to drop 
here two rc times r, partial a vector a respect to itself, 
is going to give you identity operator 
so, like partial x respect to x gives you one, right 
so, in this case you end two times rc 
this partial here this dotted 
like we talked earlier, you know, we r transpose 
r take time derivative, 
you get to two times r transposed r dot taking partial derivatives 
this gives you two times r vector, in that case 
yup 
so, if youre fuzzy this, practice this, approve identities to so, 
takes one two steps 
now, im looking this partial, so i im going to rewrite this 
twos cancel 
so partial r respect to little r is one r times rc plus little r 
right 
thats we 
now, we plug this back here well see going to get 
we minus three r to four, minus fourth is another one, 
so r to minus fifth, times rc plus little r 
you go, okay, getting close 
now, we to evaluate this sensitivity here reference r is equal to zero 
so, if i compute that partial this respect to little r r is equal to zero, 
this r becomes rc, this little r becomes zero 
you will end is minus three rc to fifth, 
times rc vector, essentially 
now, there 
so, first order expansion this function is simply rc to minus third, 
plus this term dotted little r vector 
if i go look final result here, 
thats exactly i had, one rc to third, 
minus three rc rc to fifth three times two is five, 
three plus two is five, dotted that first order expansion 
right 
so, weve gone this reasonably quickly 
this is something going to sink in unless you yourself, 
i think in one hallmarks, im asking you to this 
derive this, make sure you different binomial expansions 
linearize this start front, i showed you that, 
you know, make sure you know to take partials of, you know, typical gradient 
this is sophomore level calculus freshman level calculus, 
whenever you took calc ii that kind stuff like, right 
partials scales respect to vectors, gradients that we to get 
thats we to compute we plug this 
making this assumption that this r, 
this spacecraft is small compared to orbit 
this is star wars, death star orbiting endor something 
there this approximation wouldnt hold 
current manmade object a pretty good approximation 
so, if you plug that in, this is we that r this stuff, 
this is that stuff combines 
ive taken constants outside 
you carry this multiplication, you will see body integral rdm, 
we know center mass definition goes to zero 
we still zero one term less to worry that leaves you this part 
here, this one doesnt quite look convenient, 
in essence you see mass times distance squared 
this point, hopefully, 
spidey sense is tingling this looks like something 
that could related to inertia 
so, we to remanipulate equations, again, to get to that form 
so, if you that we lots different vector identities, 
one is double cross product if i solve minus this term, 
you bring this over, this to side, you got it, 
you relate that, this is whats inside that integral term, precisely 
so, a is equal to little r, c is equal to rc, b is equal to little r 
you apply vector identity, you end this stuff, right 
so, that though, you see immediately weve got little r, till d, 
minus little r till little r till d, that will go back body integral 
hopefully, you already this part recognize thats going to inertia term 
we something else we need to identify 
so we plug that in 
you get to here and, so assumption, 
so far, still is that little r is small compared to rc, 
spacecraft is small compared to radius orbit 
that first term, you factor rc to left, is done already, 
you factor in rc to right 
doesnt matter body integral, that means you move dm inside, 
you end classic definition 
one is rc here, you take that outside, 
you body integral little r dotted itself, 
is r squared, we 
so this term is we recognize inertia tensor, right 
that appears different places 
this one here is actually a polar moment inertia 
here we dont care it, rcs you factored out, 
give you an rc crossed rc, course, again, goes to zero, we like, right 
so that second term vanishes completely this mathematics you end with, 
i use in this inertia tensor definition 
we end this expression of, this is basically linear, you know, 
this is first order 
i shouldnt say linearized, well that differently later 
this is first order approximation gravity gradient torque, right 
we expanded one r cubed, we kept first order term 
if you want higher order terms, youd to include in expansions, 
would this plus stuff 
that would happen 
now, we write this, i specified a particular coordinate frame 
that you to express everything in 
horace 

no, vectors, vectors, even tensor stuff, right 
we know we evaluate this we to pick probably somebody fixed frame 
thats we mathematically 
generally we write tensor a coordinate frame independent way 
if you in b frame, you need in c frame, 
we know we to pre post multiply 
dcm to a coordinate transformation, right 
we treat inertia tensor like a body, a position vector velocity vector 
so, we write in a agnostic ways, is nice 
means you evaluate this make sure you orbit in frame 
inertial tensor 
coordinate system we typically use orbits 
mandar 
inertial 
you could inertial, right 
you might even use an orbit frame, well see later on, a rotating orbit frame, right 
you dont typically use a body frame 
thats probably least you scream an orbit 
couples everything in crazy ways, right 
we want something different 
inertia tensor, we tend to express that one in body frame 
so, this is an equation where, right front, 
i tell that you probably going to given this information, in real life, 
using different frames, thats fine 
so, implied in here is maybe a dcm rotation that you to 
you know, tensor vectors mapped one frame to another, thats 
so, this is compact way i write 
again, implied might important transformation you actually evaluate 
so, looking this, lets jump ahead quickly 
anybody tell type inertia tensor will lg go to zero 
tbo 
diagonal, enough, probably not, a identity scale 
yes, diagonals running 
if you distinct three different inertias, this is going to go to zero, 
you actually scaled this vector in a way 
that longer colinear itself, right 
if an identity times a scalar, 
so kind shapes give us kinds tensors 
sphere 
sphere 
cubed 
cube, right 
keep that well see that result in mathematics well 
so, here in a vectorial form you see crossproduct 
if a crossproduct times itself, whatever shape makes that happen, 
that would make gravity gradient torques, 
actually, to zeroregardless attitude
