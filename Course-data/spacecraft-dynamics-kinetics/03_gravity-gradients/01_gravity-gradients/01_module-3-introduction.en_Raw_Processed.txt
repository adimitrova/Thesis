hi welcome to third 
segment spacecraft kinetics 
here, going to studying in 
detail gravity gradient, torque 
forces that happen a rigid spacecraft 
so spacecraft, every part 
mass distribution is a different distance 
away center earth 
that means experiencing 
a different gravitational force 
now, we to sum 
a whole body 
so in particular interest to us is if 
you gravity gradient that youve 
computed, orientations a craft 
caused gravity gradient to zero 
moving in a rotating frame, 
one relative 
equilibrious will 
developing 
theres interesting examples 
you look 
one is stable 
look a tall slender object, 
lower object weighs a 
stronger gravity force top part 
so if you disturb attitude, 
this would help stabilize 
well begin to study 
configuration full d 
this is a useful topic 
theres many satellites 
gravity stabilized 
there big things 
like space station 
gravity gradients definitely 
impact attitude motion 
so, this section gives you a good 
handle to predict that torque
