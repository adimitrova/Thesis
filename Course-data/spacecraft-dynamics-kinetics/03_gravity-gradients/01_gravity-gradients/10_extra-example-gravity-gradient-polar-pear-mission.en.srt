1
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,749
After all that math and
linearization and everything,

2
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:10,841
it really boils down to a pretty simple.

3
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:15,948
This is how you fly an equilibrium which
we've identified all three axis line up,

4
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,574
all three orbit axis have to be
principle axis of the body so

5
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:23,530
you line that dictates
particular orientations.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,531
And then, to be stable, you have to
make sure this condition is satisfied.

7
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:32,280
And it's not just one, if this is stable,
flying sideways, you know?

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,480
And so is this one, right?

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,030
You could fly nose up and nose down.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,710
Do you care if you're flying nose up or
nose down?

11
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,760
>> But it depends on the application.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,220
If the shuttle does not want to use fuel,
it doesn't care.

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,020
This spacecraft did care.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,970
This is a famous one,
the Polar Bear Mission,

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,473
it has, you can see these gravity
grating stabilized, all need.

16
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:07,260
[LAUGH] they need the three
axis to be the skinnier one, so

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,060
they put the small mass and to save weight
on a very thin boom all the way out.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,060
And so now the inertias about any
other axis are going to be big,

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,670
because of the big moment arm between
this mass and this honking mass.

20
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,910
But along the axis,
that's the least inertia.

21
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,790
That's what we needed for
stability, right?

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,840
And they go through this stuff, and
I2, bigger than I1, bigger than I3.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,030
Life is good, what could go wrong?

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,480
This craft does care that this
point is looking at the earth.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,700
Why?

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,870
That's why they put all the sensors.

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,880
It didn't put them on this side.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,058
So this was launched to gravity
gradiants stabilize the satellite,

29
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:46,569
reasonable mass, not huge but,
reasonable mass.

30
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,216
And it was supposed to point this way,
and what actually happened after

31
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:56,189
the first period in full sunlight,
the attitude degraded significantly.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,210
Which basically means shit happened,
bad stuff happened.

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,904
Attitude degraded significantly,
essentially, means it inverted itself.

34
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:12,948
Instead of being here and a little bit
stable, this whole actually tumbled,

35
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,373
banded off to go there.

36
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:17,880
And then you go back through the shadow,
and everything is good.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,090
And now we said, this is stable.

38
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,940
But so is this.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,230
And in this case, we do care.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,400
But the satellite doesn't,
it's just following physics.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,310
And it goes, hey, I'm perfectly happy.

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,540
You can bump me all you want.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,740
I'm stable, I'm going to stay here.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,200
So it's like, great.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,590
What on Earth does happened?

46
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,930
And it wasn't supposed to happen.

47
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,325
So, several attempts were made
to reinvent this thing and

48
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:42,246
finally they were able to get it.

49
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,140
They basically have to give it a kick.

50
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,040
And the way they can give it a kick
without using fuel is, despin or

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,742
spin off your wheel to crazy amounts
is going to apply this huge torque.

52
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:55,080
They needed something to move it pass
this linear local state stable regime.

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,933
And once the bigger motion happened
just basically give it a kick and

54
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,783
it tumbled and then recovered and
this other one.

55
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,283
And then use the wheel to clean
up the mess and get it close and

56
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,589
hopefully stay stable again.

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,130
So, good news is they
were able to recover,

58
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,600
bad news is why does it even happen?

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,655
Jordan, you got a question.

60
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:18,940
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> What did we miss here then?

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,140
What assumption do you think was
violated with the space craft?

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,990
And there's a clue.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,159
After the first period
of fully sunlit orbit.

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,050
What happens with sunlight
put in a space craft?

65
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,748
>> A radiation pressure.

66
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:37,644
>> Could be radiation pressure,
they don't think that was the cause but

67
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:42,069
definitely something I would look at, is
the [INAUDIBLE] do you have a craft which

68
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,030
this huge solar sails basically
attached that would cause significant.

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,460
They don't think that was the cause here,
but definitely related.

70
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,090
Spencer?

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,640
>> Outgassing?

72
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,580
>> I think outgassing you've always have,
or

73
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,820
what causes more outgassing in
the sunlight condition do you think?

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,560
>> I figured in the first fully
sunlit orbit that it would

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,750
have out-gassed most of what it
was going to out-gassed initially.

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,153
>> You think because it's a first orbit,
not because it's sunlit.

77
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,577
>> Yeah.

78
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,390
>> Maybe.

79
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,820
Again, I don't have the details of this,
but these are all good ideas.

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,710
Right now, you start to wonder,
what did we miss?

81
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,240
What's going on here?

82
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,255
What happens with sunlight, though?

83
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,290
>> Heating up.

84
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,820
>> You heat up.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,980
This is a very lightweight structure.

86
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,680
What heats up, is one side of it.

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,520
What happens to the other side?

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,990
Or what happens to the heated breath?

89
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,924
I can see some-
>> That side will expand [INAUDIBLE] so

90
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:33,660
[INAUDIBLE].

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,030
>> And if we're curving,
what do we violate?

92
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,190
Rigid?

93
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,630
It's not rigid, this was a really,
really lightweight structure,

94
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,020
they had to get this tucker way out there.

95
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,100
There's not much stiffness to this and
they didn't really

96
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,240
model well the thermal deformations that
can happen on these kinds of an orbit.

97
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,790
So there was flexing going on.

98
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,308
Now flexing doesn't necessarily
immediately make it go crazy.

99
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:58,845
But this was just an unlucky mission
that flexing happened to be happening in

100
00:04:58,845 --> 00:04:59,408
such a way.

101
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:02,382
That it was able to give it
the right kick at the right time,

102
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,600
to get out of one equilibrium and
in the end once it all settled,

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,770
it settle into the other equilibrium.

104
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,100
Perfectly stable, that's the trickiness.

105
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,190
Gravity gradiants do stabilize.

106
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,070
But it really doesn't care if
it's positive or negative.

107
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,360
Every one of those equilibriums has
a flip that's still like an equilibrium.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,423
And if you do care,

109
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:23,486
then you have to have a mean to put
it into the right equilibrium, right?

110
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,070
And then locally it's there.

111
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,870
And so here's a case a lesson's learned,

112
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,926
where the thermal deformations
really did matter.

113
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:34,730
And so flex endure, that's what
I heard was the primary culprit.

114
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,340
All these other ideas are fantastic ideas,
and I'm sure they tested every one of

115
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,510
those as well, just make notice
another bounding case assumption.

116
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,540
With these even cause this effect right?

117
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,350
To model and simulate that.

118
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,580
So, it gets tricky.
