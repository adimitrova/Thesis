1
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:08,690
Kinetic energy, let's start here.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,710
Now we did this for blobs in space.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,585
And for blobs in space we were able to
show kinetic energy was nothing but

4
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:20,005
the kinetic energy off the center
of mass plus kinetic energy

5
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,455
about the center of mass.

6
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,555
But this second term contains
both deformational energy,

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:28,100
if panels are flexing and
doing or fuel is sloshing.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,580
And the rotational part, right?

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,490
Now let's use the same assumption.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,574
r dot for a rigid body,
it doesn't go to zero, but

11
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:40,360
the r dot just became omega crossed r,
the body relative derivative of zero.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,860
So we're also just going to
focus on the rotational side.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
This is basically your translational
energy which comes out of

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,740
your orbits class.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,050
We're not going to focus on orbits in
here, just the rotational dynamics, so

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,070
we're not going to cover that.

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,050
And this is where I plugged
in r dot is omega cross r.

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,970
So you get a bunch of cross products,
dot product.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,990
And you know right away there
must be some magic trick identity

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,580
that we can rearrange this.

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,200
That's kind of what I'm doing here,
almost actually.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,290
First, and I'm using trig here, this omega
is a constant as seen of the integration.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,590
If it's rigid, every point has
to be rotating at the same rate.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,520
So this omega I can just take outside.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,620
There's a dot product.

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,690
Okay I did use a vector identity
already to rewrite this into this form,

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,530
and now I could take your omega
outside to the dot product.

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,100
Here I'm still left with
omega in the middle but

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,420
we have the trick that
a cross b is minus b cross a.

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,310
That puts it on the right hand side.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,570
And you can take that one out as well.

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,048
In fact if you go back and look at Hc,
this whole definition is nothing but Hc.

33
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:51,908
In fact this term becomes nothing but
your inertia tense times omega.

34
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,379
And the inertia tense times
omega was nothing but

35
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,340
angular momentum about that point c.

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,220
So it's nice, we now have, rotational
energy can simply be written as one half

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,160
omega dotted with angular momentum.

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,030
Those are two vectors dotted together.

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,150
When you dot them,

40
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,280
mathematically make sure they're
taken with respect to the same frame.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,963
But here is written in
a frame agnostic way.

42
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:17,713
So angle rotation, so
that's the same thing, H is I omega,

43
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:22,524
you might remember as rotational energy
being inertia over 2 times angular

44
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:25,460
rate squared for fixed axis rotation.

45
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,360
This is the 3D version of that.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,430
You would have one-half
omega transpose I omega.

47
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,300
And that's basically inertia omega squared
over 2, essentially that's what it is.

48
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,190
Power.

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,507
We had earlier,
if the time derivative from a blob,

50
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:46,862
the first part translation was just force
times the inertial velocity, again,

51
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,733
that's the translational sign.

52
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,633
What we do care about here is T dot.

53
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:56,260
So if you differentiate this term,
you will end up with this.

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,380
Now to get this form, you need to have
the rotational equations of motion,

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,100
which we haven't derived yet.

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,530
But I will let you, this is something
you should make a note in exam,

57
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,370
definitely go back and make sure you can
go from here to here, but it simplifies.

58
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,760
But the beauty of this is,
for translation,

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,100
we have force started with
translational velocity.

60
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,710
With rotation, you have torque
dotted with angular velocity.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,710
It's really the same type of
term that we're going to have.

62
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,250
And that's what makes,
this is what gives you your power rate.

63
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:28,967
To the system.

64
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,580
When is T-dot going to be zero?

65
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,930
Let's ignore translation,
we'll just focus on this.

66
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,216
When is my power equation
going to be zero?

67
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:46,920
Sheila, what do you think?

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,942
Without reading more,
I want to hear you think.

69
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:58,750
>> The angular velocity is zero or-
>> You could, if you're not spinning.

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,310
>> Center of mass is acceleration is zero,
the Rc.

71
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,268
>> Well we're going in
translation right now.

72
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,530
>> Okay.
>> Just focus on this one,

73
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,790
the rotational side.

74
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,750
What makes this second term go to zero?

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,240
Omega could be zero, yes.

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,540
It's kind of a trivial
dynamical system then, yes,

77
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,440
if the energy is zero then
the energy rate is going to be zero.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,930
But that works, yep.

79
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,669
What else could you do?

80
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,340
>> [INAUDIBLE] Make Lc zero.

81
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,515
>> So what is Lc here?

82
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,330
[INAUDIBLE].

83
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,830
>> No?

84
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,580
What is LC here?

85
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,330
>> Torque.

86
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,880
>> It's a torque.

87
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,295
So this is a torque about point c.

88
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,612
And in fact when we get this torque,

89
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:45,114
this torque is due to external forces
when we derived all this stuff.

90
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:49,964
So for this dynamical system,
if your external torque on that

91
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,990
rigid body is zero,
you won't dissipate energy.

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,900
This makes a great integration check.

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,490
So as you guys are writing numerical code,
you've got something that's spinning and

94
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,160
there's no external torque on this system.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,975
I know energy has to be preserved.

96
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:09,350
If we had H dot equal to L,
that was the same thing.

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,110
The angle momentum as seen
by the inertial observer,

98
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,120
that's what that dot meant right,
inertial derivative.

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,180
As seen by inertial observer,

100
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,800
H has to be a constant vector if no
external torque is acting on it.

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,530
These things become fantastic
integration checks.

102
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,180
This is for a single rigid body.

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,940
But even if you do multi-body,
complex panels flapping, reaction wheels,

104
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,540
gyros spinning, twisting, this stuff
still has to hold, which is really nice.

105
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,010
And now if there is a torque
acting on that system.

106
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,310
I can actually predict very quickly
how my kinetic energy needs to change.

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,750
And this becomes a nice integration check,
because I can compute kinetic energy from

108
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,990
the simulation numerically and
then differentiate it to get T dot.

109
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,160
And compare,

110
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,940
I know I applied this gravity gradient
torque, this is my spin rate at the time.

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,840
Energy should have changed by this
many joules per second, right?

112
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
So these tools becomes very,
very useful validation tools, but also for

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,662
analysis you will see.

114
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:10,990
So torque-free motion is when
momentum is inertially preserved and

115
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,560
kinetic energy is preserved,
because this is zero.

116
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,750
The third option actually could exist,
in that the dot product goes to zero.

117
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,480
Maybe you have very particular torques
being applied, such that no matter what

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,100
your spin rate is, right now
the torques are orthogonal to that.

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,680
In that case you have
a non-working force acting on it.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,930
That's what they call
it because it doesn't,

121
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,690
not doing work means it doesn't
change my energy state.

122
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,190
So there's three ways,
either omega zero, Lc zero, or

123
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,650
those two things are orthogonal.

124
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,040
Then T dot goes to zero.

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,875
And again over, if you have to work down
between points and time, you can do this

126
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,152
with a time integral or you could
also do it in the spatial integral.
