we a slender rod 
thats falling to ground 
so basically, think this rod 
you sign in this 
a frictionless surface 
think an ice rink, a slick ice 
rink hes standing 
reason this is perturbed 
theres friction force here 
holding lower end in place 
so you slide youre 
going to slide 
so basically going to 
fall slide like this 
thats whats going to happen 
going to try to find 
here equations motion 
going to use 
principles, super particle theorem, 
hl equal to l 
inertia tenser definitions so 
forth to derive right quantities 
so im giving you here a material 
statics book you find easily 
if you a slender rod inertia 
center mass is mass 
l squared, ls length rod 
so slender means 
ignoring dimensions 
a homogeneous, very, 
thin mass distribution, right 
so thats you get there 
so going, okay, so we that 
lets look angular momentum 
if we want to write hc, angle 
momentum center mass, 
we needed inertia tensor times 
angular velocity this stuff 
you see, 
ive got a body fixed point, 
a body fixed frame, e, 
that im defining here 
so el, e theta, is e pointing 
let make sure youre 
looking picture, right 
board board 

board, right 
el, e theta, e, 
third finger points board, 
thats pointing, okay 
so angular velocity 
tilting in d, 
going to theta dot e, 
right 
so thats this part right here, 
two terms, 
thats omega e relative to n 
this body 
i need inertia tensor this 
one, so lets write that one 
youve seen matrix notations, 
i want to make sure that you 
get this stuff right 
so if we this in e frame, 
a principle frame, 
you will i, i, i 
and, lets ignore this 
e relative to n, theta dot e 
theta dot e look 
like a matrix 
, , theta dot, right 
yes, you inertias 
we said, a slender rod so 
there terms that 
in end, 
this matrix times this matrix is 
going to give , 
, i theta dot, right 
in different components, 
is equivalent to 
that i theta dot e 
in this problem i is 
n l squared 
thats inertia that, 
third axis that we have, in 
board 
right, we didnt need 
inertias long axis 
anything else like that 
thats where, so youve, 
this is something you want to practice 
clicks, 
you go this ever confusing 
you want to able to go 
inertia stuff to this quick 
formulations especially 
plane rotation 
always give 
you equivalent results 
so good, so thats we get this part 
we to angle momentum c 
to get equations motion, 
one way we often rotational 
side is we use eulers equation, 
means h dot l taking moments 
center mass, h dot l holds 
i need to l 
center mass 
so lets see we here 
torch is applied 
torch thats 
applied here is this normal force, 
somethings holding that tip 
sliding beneath i surface, right 
so i is still pushing 
pushing laterally 
so giving lateral stability, 
is holding that point in place, 
right 
gravitys acting this 
doesnt gravity cause torques 
ax center mass 
right, gravity ax center 
mass therefore moment 
gravity force 
thats you apply it, 
would actually vanish 
good, okay 
so, we need moment arm 
is point force relative to 
center mass thats this vector 
so, this length is l, so 
if going here to here is minus 
l in el direction, right 
back to week one, 
vectors distances times direction 
distance is el 
direction is minus el hat 
thats moment arm 
crossed force, 
is normal force surface, 
right 
you an el crossed in n 
well youre going to to map one 
thats you get, 
a sign term in here in terms e 
so we write this 
so good, looking 
equations motion theta, 
a sudden we to 
introduce an extra unknown 
we dont know this 
force is surface 
so we know right away h equal 
to l is going to enough 
you cant two 
unknowns in one equation 
people try, try really hard, 
doesnt work 
so well need additional equations 
lets first wrap this up, 
we h, we l, 
derivative this h, inertial 
derivative to equal to this l 
well e, this is a rotating frame 
you say e 
is that a rotating axis 
a fixed heading axis 
fixed, actually, right 
two that rotating 
so e is actually n, 
thing minus n 
ns definitely an inertial frame so 
thats taken intertial 
derivative this, i dont 
to treat e a rotating axis 
actually a fixed axis 
so this inertia is fixed 
im changing mass 
distribution rod 
thing that varies is theta 
so you quickly get inertia 
times theta double dot 
here ive dropped e 
in end, 
everythings along e axis 
so gives one thing 
so h dot equal to l 
i brought l to left hand side 
thats that comes in 
so this is one equation 
im looking always second 
order differential equations 
equations motion 
so acceleration, thats theta 
double dot acceleration equation 
an extra unknown 
so h dot equal to l enough, 
else we 
people 
super particle theorem energy 
energy here is pretty smart 
theres friction 
yeah, energy doesnt typically 
help quite in equations 
motion typically 
principles we use is either h l, 
theres different points we could use 
weve used point c 
point 
we could used 
an inertia point that 
another approach 
you try h equal to l center 
mass inertial point 
give you different information 
that might a way 
to get a second equation 
going to here is 
actually use newtons equation 
basically, super particle theorem, right 
that said, well whatever sum 
external forces is, 
mass times inertial 
acceleration to center mass, 
to equal to that force, right 
so if we that, 
center mass location, 
im going to call this coordinate y, 
you see here 
so y doubled in two 
center mass is moving in n 
direction 
that makes easy, 
an inertial direction 
take twice derivative 
y doubly ny doubled in two 
thats big m times rc 
double dot that we to 
review particle theorem, right 
that to equal to sum 
forces acting system, 
this system two forces 
there is a force surface thats 
pushing back pen tip, 
keeping in place 
theres gravity acting slot 
thats falling 
otherwise, if you slippery 
surface space station 
without human slip 
so gravity n 
in n direction 
ng is in n direction so 
this gives you differential equation 
you look this go, i see 
brian already going wait a minute 
we get an end thats good 
we introduce a y 
we seem to chasing tail here 
every time we an equation 
we an extra unknown 
so we two equations three 
unknowns making progress 
brians absolutely right, 
so we missing 
we need an extra equation 
y theta independent 
spencer, two independent 
coordinates dynamical system 
another question is, this dynamical 
system many degrees freedom 
one 
one, right, 
theres one degree freedom 
theres one angle, right 
that angle, we prescribe 
that height to 
so there must a geometric relationship 
between y coordinate 
theta coordinates, right 
you y theta, this didnt 
turn a two degree freedom problem 
still a one degree 
freedom problem 
so is relationship 
thats we here 
simple, this line would l 
cosine, that gets you to heighth y 
thats i here, right 
so if i theta, i know y 
here, i need theta double dot, 
that means you simply take times 
derivative this y expression, 
chain rule this cosine, so you get 
sines cosines stuff 
thats y double 
dots relate to thetas 
theta dots theta double dots, right 
so not, we two kinematic 
variables that convenient 
this y convenient 
writing f ma 
in end, 
we to pick one 
write everything in terms 
one coordinates 
so if you this, you plug this in here 
you now, 
actually this depends y 
n, this depends y theta, 
i write n in terms theta 
so i get rid one variables, y 
last step is this, 
this to go back in here 
we write 
equations motion 
this slender rod falling in place, 
slipping like this 
looks a little bit complicated 
amazing life gets complicated 
quickly, even simple examples 
this differential equation, 
is this a linear differential equation 
a nonlinear differential equation 
nonlinear 
theres sines, 
cosines states, right 
theres even theta dot squares, sine 
squared stuff, definitely linear 
so thinks quickly 
solve this differential equation 
darn, i always hope somebody raises 
hand i want to talk to you 
a phd program 
i cant solve this 
maybe a mathematician solve this 
tricky, right 
so we solve this 
well, we go back to integration, right 
you put this in state space form 
x is equal to theta 
x is equal to theta dot 
you get sets equations 
you integrate 
so numerically, problem 
analytically, this a challenge 
often in problems 
we want to least 
integration one time 
that means, im looking 
relationship between positions rates 
happens, youve done this, 
high school physics problems 
bouncing balls, 
perfectly elastic bouncing ball, right 
total energy to preserved 
a conservative system 
so therefore, we 
potential energy ball, 
we kinetic energy 
youre up, 
you a lot potential energy 
kinetic energy 
let go, trades potential energy 
kinetic energies, 
sum to 
potential energy always 
depends position 
never rates 
kinetic energy, you see definition 
always ex dots, theta dots, 
rate coordinates 
so if youre looking a relationship, 
one homeworks asks you 
this in part b in particularly, 
whats relationship 
between states rates 
first step shouldnt necessarily 
to try to integrate this equation 
that might quite hard 
trick is youre going to look 
is system conservative, 
if yes, 
we look energy balance 
so people talking 
earlier energy, 
this is typically i use energy 
systems i come directly 
in analytic, this angle 
is rate going to to 
good conservative 
in this system theres 
lateral friction 
theres nothing work system 
a conservative one 
this point here is work 
this point is moving 

work is typically force 
times distance moved 
this point is moving 
in this direction 
so this force end also 
this system is conservative 
we use conservation 
so this part hopefully boring 
simple, mgh, right 
this case, y, 
we in terms angle theta 
i know potential 
energy is this rod 
i need total mass this rod, 
moment arm, 
height surface, ive got that 
kinetic energy, 
remember i get this 
kinetic energy, like momentum, i break 
kinetic energy center 
mass plus kinetic energy 
center mass 
weird complicated tumbling things like 
this i really recommend that approach 
sometimes there shortcuts 
stuff that you quickly 
this is a way thats rigorous, you 
wont double count terms a sudden 
so kinetic energy, 
center mass is mass 
times 
velocity well is y dot 
we know to relate 
y dot to theta dot right, 
using that earlier geometry 
expression differentiating 
here is moment 
times theta dot squared 
thats onehalf omega 
transpose i omega 
put back everythings e 
simplifies to 
simple scalar equation 
so weve got that 
so you plug in that kinematic 
relation between y dot 
theta theta dot simplify 
this is you end 
so you something similar 
in homework to this 
so we kinetic energy 
potential energy 
if you sum two up, im seeing 
initially this rod is standing up, 
yes, something to disturb 
disturb 
treating us infinitesimal 
so total energy is basically 
initial potential 
something turns ever so 
slightly will start to slip, right 
so initial one is this 
we want to look is 
relationship a later time so 
we know a later time we plug in this 
plus this to always equal to this 
this is total energy system 
so matter far you slipped 
whatever angle youre at, 
i come a relationship 
in fact, solve theta 
dot we here analytically 
so energys become powerful 
expressions that we use in 
systems to actually predict great 
relationships to states well 
if you looked prior 
differential equations, 
i would challenge anybody 
to glance this 
predict that this is 
states rates to relate 
intuitive, 
thats we principles, 
mathematical processes 
in there in place, to that 
so anyway that kind wraps that one 
questions this example 
so you solve this equations, 
theres a few in homework, 
if you want to look h dot equal to l, 
apply points that make sense 
either center mass, 
thats often a good place to start 
you might find that 
inertial point well 
that might, 
equations might give 
you information you need 
one that we is 
f m a center mass, 
thats super particle theorem 
between combinations that you 
always get states, 
everything that you need 
if you multiple kinematic states, 
one degree freedom look 
geometric relationship 
theta relate to y z 
whatever you introduced, right 
if statement is somehow 
relates states to rates 
immediately think energies 
look system likely 
to system is conservative 
that allows you to exploit 
conservation energy in way 
come relationships, okay 
good, so thats good stop, not, 
well that topic that ends there 
weve got two minutes, thats good 
well lets a quick thought experiment 
so well move next 
is torque free motion 
daniel already mentioned earlier that if 
torque free motion certain special 
things happen 
in fact, 
spacecraft deployed a rocket, 
initial stage is always 
tumbling in one way a manner 
you to recover, 
maybe we use magnetic torque bars 
we use thrusters 
reaction wheels, something 
we want to go positive 
different challenges 
even otherwise, you dont 
a situation typically youre 
continuously controlling attitude 
you run resources, 
even reaction that 
use electrical energy 
a lot effort 
you try to exploit much you 
natural dynamics, 
natural dynamics is torque, 
there 
so we come 
spacecraft that spin 
people that quite often 
spin stabilize a single rigid body 
well looking dual spinners that 
means we multiple parts that spin, 
without feedback 
multiple parts thats basically 
a stepping stone reaction wheels, 
momentum exchange devices, 
well derive afterwards 
stay there well 
so thats kind motivation 
we want to look torque free motions 
really a classic problem, even three 
axis control days you still want to 
understand different modes 
motions stable 
motion unstable 
one equilibria spin conditions 
if i put in a particular spin, 
will stay there 
will wobble that spin 
go get in way 
one way we investigate that 
ends angular momentum 
angular momentum vector h a rigid 
body, we know if torquefree, h dot 
to equal to immediately 
gives us a constraint equation 
this first cut though 
is complicated 
if i everything in inertia frame, 
i will get three components 
to ce zero 
thats great momentum in 
body frame, if i a principal 
coordinate frame, is simply i omega , 
i omega , i omega , right 
we mentioned principal coordinate frame 
that inertia tension thats diagonal 
so becomes a simple product 
h is equal to i omega 
we to map this 
inertial frame 
here im using inaudible in 
terms three to one euler angles 
immediately, 
you get relationships 
you see theres tons sines 
cosines omegas 
everything varies time 
true, thats a constraint, 
to wrap brain around 
that get analytic insight 
so next time we start 
going to start here 
im going to show you a different approach 
leads to pole hold methods 
you taken 
seen a little this stuff already 
a classic approach in 
we discuss stability, 
well take a step 
that well
