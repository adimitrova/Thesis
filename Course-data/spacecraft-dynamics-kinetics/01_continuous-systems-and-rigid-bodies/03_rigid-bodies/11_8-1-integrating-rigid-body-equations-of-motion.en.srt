1
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:10,970
So, we want to integrate in a coupled way.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,200
So, let's talk about this as you
can be writing code like that.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,353
Let's just use sigmas.

4
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm using my attitude being
explicit here all right?

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,860
The other set of stakes that I
have to integrate now are omegas.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,200
So, we're going to put in
an omega B relative to N.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,390
So, your code you've written earlier to
integrate just the attitude rates can

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,790
even omega.

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,340
It all works, it's just instead of omega
being looked up in a separate sine and

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,860
cosines or some function,
it's now computed every time step and

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,730
updated as well.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,430
So you have to do
everything simultaneously.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,700
Your x dot equals to F function.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,630
F is basically the first part
is nothing but sigma dot.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,070
And the second part is omega dot.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,470
That's what you have to find.

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,090
In your code, you already have this part.

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,190
So you know that and it's based on
the current omega, the integration,

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,020
that's fine.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,660
And now this one,
also depends on the current omega but

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,080
it also needs the inertia
tensor representation.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,490
And it needs to know what the external
torques are and that's it.

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,570
So you can see once you have those
nice clean writings set up for

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,330
dynamical systems,
we can then easily expand.

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,640
Later on if we have reaction wheels,
we have to keep track,

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,040
those are extra states,
CMGs, extra states.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,380
You just start expanding the state vector.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,710
But you can build on your prior work,
and that makes life much easier, okay.

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,890
Any questions on this?

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,365
So, these are basic equations of motion.

31
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:43,620
H dot equal to L you saw.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,207
It's like two lines with
the right arguments, and

33
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,351
you get the equations of motion
in a very general tensor form.
