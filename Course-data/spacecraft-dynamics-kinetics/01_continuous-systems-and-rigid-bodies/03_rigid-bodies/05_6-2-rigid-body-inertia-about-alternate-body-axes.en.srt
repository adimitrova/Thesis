1
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,855
The other one is,
what if we have a different body frame.

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:14,567
There's an infinity of frames I can attach
to a rigid body and be a body fixed frame.

3
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:20,040
In our derivation, all we assume was that
the derivative as seen by b was zero.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,690
But there's an infinity of such frames.

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,060
So, and
you will see in real life a lot of frames.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,430
There might be a docking port frame.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,220
There's a flight frame.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,160
There's a space craft frame.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,190
There's a structure frame.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,090
There's a sensor frame.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,100
There's a star truck of frame.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,510
There's a gyro frame.

13
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,710
There's lots of frames, right.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,980
And all of a sudden I need the inertia
now about some other frame.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,200
I don't want to redo that integrals again.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,510
How do we translate it?

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,730
And this is the answer in essence.

18
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,610
You remember how we did vectors?

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,060
So, with a two-letter notation,
this becomes dead simple.

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,560
So, if we have a vector in the n-frame and

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,720
I want a vector into the b-frame I have
to multiply this times the Dc once.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,200
Now, ten serves our industry initial
times like two dimensional vectors.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,000
So, I'll still use the DCM to mark
from one frame to another, but

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,270
I have to use the DCM twice.

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,040
And that's what this formula shows.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,530
Again, I'm not going to derive this
in a book, but you can go to that.

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,610
It's a very simple one.

28
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,600
With these two letter notation you can
see this the tensor having one frame B.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,610
I'm trying to get the tensor
in different frame F.

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,050
And now I have to pre and post multiply
it on both sides times the right DCM.

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,320
So here it's FB times FB transpose.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,280
Another way to write it would be FB this
inertia tensor to B frame times BF, right.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,800
So, then from the left and right hand
side your mapping things to the F frame,

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,660
then you know you're on the right track.

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,050
But that's it.

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,030
So, we used the DCM twice.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Any questions on this one?

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,880
I assuming many of you
actually seen this before.

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
Some of you may not,

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,470
but you can catch up then with
the details with the notes in the book.

41
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,120
Now, does an infinity frames
we typically like a frame

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,330
that makes our inertia tensor
diagonal especially for an analysis.

43
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,180
So, every rigid body can be
expressed with the body fixed with

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,590
the particular body fixed frame such
that the inertia tend to representation.

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,040
Becomes diagonal,

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,870
then I only have to track three inertia
terms not nine in that whole full thing.

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,410
So, for analysis, this is very, very
handy, and we want to be able to do this.

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,010
In the code, when we write simulations,
we're going to solve for

49
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,440
control problems, where we just use the
inertia tensor eye in a very general way,

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,980
because that way we're not requiring
somebody to have found that magic place,

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,320
and then what if you get rid of some fuel,
now things have shifted.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,480
We can write it in
a very very general way.

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,980
In the codes.

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,520
But for analysis,
this is a very handy thing.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,590
So, how do we find this?

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,440
Let's see, this is the original one.

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,380
This is my FB over here,
I've taken this FB transposed and

58
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,090
brought it over to the right.

59
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,960
Over here by right multiplying times FB.

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,300
So, that same matrix appears here and
here.

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,210
And then when you start to carry
out those components and equate,

62
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,240
what does this have to be?

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,630
This basically sums it up there.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,490
You can go ahead and
you will quickly find that this DCM again,

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,180
becomes nothing but
an eigenvalue-eigenvector problem.

66
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,740
In fact, what you have is,
the rows of this DCM are the eigenvectors

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,380
of this three by three matrix
representation of the body's inertia.

68
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,930
And the principle inertias,

69
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,050
that's what we call these things when we
do it in diagonal form, are nothing but

70
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,860
the eigenvalues associated
to these eigenvectors.

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,610
So again, for
eigenvectors to form at the ECM though,

72
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,290
we need them to be normal,
probably should have had hats on here.

73
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,120
These have to be unit vectors, all right?

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,300
And they have to be orthogonal.

75
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,240
And the other key result is
you have to be right-handed.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,650
This is a big error source
people have right here

77
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,230
because Matlab just
gives you three vectors.

78
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,740
It has no idea what you're trying to do.

79
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,050
So what you have to check in the end is
when you assemble this matrix is that

80
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:31,730
the V1 cross to V2 has to give you Plus V3
and Mathlab doesn't check that for you.

81
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,090
All right?
It may give you minus V3.

82
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,920
So if you get something that's
left-handed, just reverse the sign of one

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,750
of them and now you have a coordinate
frame that is right-handed.

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,510
But this gives you the mapping from the
current E frame into a principle frame F

85
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,240
whose representation ends up being
just the three diagonal inertias.

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,450
Which you have, good.

87
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,800
So with these two tricks,
power access and this one, we can now,

88
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,580
we never, once we have the inertia tense.

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,230
So we tend to not have to redo
that body interval again.

90
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,220
You simply have some nice clean analytic
mappings to shift origin or to shift

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,560
the body fix point of a body frame
all the components are taken Yes sir.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,680
>> So the F frame is just a frame
where the inertia tensor is nice?

93
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,660
>> Yes.

94
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,550
And if you looked at statics mechanics
books it tends to be like symmetry axes.

95
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,650
You can quickly see that's where
everything bounces out and

96
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,230
these off diagonal terms, they all vanish.

97
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,570
So, if you had that, this pen, if one
axes lines up with this symmetry axes and

98
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,030
the other two are orthogonal That
would give you that kind of a frame.

99
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,020
But if somebody gives you this weird
frame where this is your stuff and

100
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,330
you're putting it in a skewed way,
you're going to have all this stuff.

101
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,680
So if you have this and that's your body,
and you're going okay, I can always make

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,370
a coordinate transformation such that this
becomes diagonal and then we can go there.

103
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,690
And this is really nice for analysis,
because without loss of generality you can

104
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,146
always assume I can write my rigid body
tumbling motion in a principle cone form

105
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:59,611
in which case I'll only have
three inertias to worry about.
