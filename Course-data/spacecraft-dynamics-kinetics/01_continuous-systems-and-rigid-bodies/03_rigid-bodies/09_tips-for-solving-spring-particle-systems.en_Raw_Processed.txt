another one, i wanted to highlight, 
this comes a lot, is this one 
this problem here 
mass two 
weve done everything in class that you 
need to get equations motion 
so getting equations 
motion mechanical systems, 
type fundamental 
properties we use 
lewis 
inaudible 

to get equations motion 
we use conservation 
energy if im looking 
relationships between rates states 
you cant use conservation energy 
to get second order differential 
equations 
inaudible 
okay 
so theres f equals mass times 
acceleration vector 
right 
this hold 
mass 
okay, mass constant, else 
inaudible 
this to inertial derivatives, so 
this r vector to taken 
relative to an inertial point 
you take inertial time derivatives, 
yeah, else 
constant 
well, yeah mass is constant, yep 
apply to this pen 
russell, youre saying yes 
constant mass 
constant mass 
so is good rigid bodies 
inaudible 
laugh 
laugh 
okay 
inaudible 
youre applying to 
inaudible 
laugh 
im getting wet theres so 
much back paddling here 
okay 
laugh 
so yes to this to 
this is made 
come on, hard is that right 
question 
people write whole phds 
this equation 
anybody orbitz, 
you tell parents thats 
i spent five years working 
this equation you know 
thats 
f ma 
hard is 
is hard 
gets quickly hard 
so apply to 
im saying this pen 
we use f ma this pen 
andre, you think 
absolutely 
okay, good answer 
second part is 


laugh 
you want to model trajectory 
pen something 
laugh part pen 
i need specifically 
center mass 
center mass 
right 
we call that theorem 
super particle theorem 
super particle theorem, right 
so f ma holds 
super particle theorem 
thats, in fact, you whole 
problem, you basically ignore 
rest mass distribution, 
you say space station is a point 
is a decent assumption 
analysis, 
obviously a good assumption 
analysis 
depends youre 
so good, so this could true 
a whole system a point mass 
we typically written 
point masses 
if a super particle theorem, 
is f that case 
external forces 
a single external force 
sum 
sum external influences 
that happened system, right 
so thats important you 
actually use that in this system to argue 
things there external 
forces this dynamical systems 
if you ask that mean, 
if not, 
that mean 
center mass motion 
thats one them, so this works 
a system, also works 
a particle 
dont forget basics 
you fma a particle well, 
this also holds, 
you to write this relative 
to inertial point, 
im going to give you tape, 
doesnt to point dot here 
theres a much convenient inertial 
point in this problem that you could write 
everything relative to 
things become simple 
whats 
equation that weve used 
so we fma particles 
center math if a system 
in this case you could either 
you could free body diagram 
that else 
hl 
hl 
right 
that also works if you say hl, 
youre taking points 
like moments talk point 
well you pick point right 
center mass is 
youre 
crosstalk 
you use center mass 
is there different points you could 
could an inertial point, 
right, either 
you play that 
you write momentum 
this, you equations 
you will find maybe 
combinations this 
you to enough, many 
degrees freedom system 
two, rules freedom is 
many independence states 
you need to fully describe 
current configuration, right 
r, theres i think 
this here a radius r 
you angle theta 
so in end you need differential 
equations these, right 
so youre going to to use 
vector equations break 
theres many different ways 
you solve this, right 
this is something im looking 
you to apply principles 
theres lots easy ways you it, 
breaking everything down, 
sines cosines galore, im giving 
you a rotating frame a reason 
i want you to use that e theta direction 
write that way, itll give you 
an answer thats actually really, 
really fast compact 
thats youre looking 
you see to apply 
principles goes very, quickly
