enough blobs, lets get rigid 
right, so going to deal 
everything on, things going to freeze 
instead general continuum, 
i think this is a good classic thing 
earlier stuff, definitely things 
that i will put exam 
something like thats going to 
there guaranteed 
going to freeze 
we that 
that change definitions 
change momentum, energy, 
this kind stuff 
we want to look this 
so angular momentum a point o, 
this is an inertial origin 
ive picked that already 
i write that position vector 
cross dots 
that goes to dm 
i didnt draw dms here anymore 
this is a rigid boby 
so if rigid, every point in 
body angular velocity 
if im spinning, speed 
right hand is different 
speed left hand, 
velocity, right 
ones moving forward, thats 
a different vector a velocity vector 
moving backwards relative to me, 
opposite you guys, right 
angular velocity, 
if spinning, 
everybody needs to rotating 
one degree per second 
otherwise if panel number two is 
rotating two degrees per second, 
panel number one is rotating 
one degree per second, 
panels going to 
catch point, right 
deforming, thats a rigid body 
so we argued, rc common 
body integrals here we would 
tricks we say omega is constant 
a rigid body blog jello 
thats true everybody could 
spinning in different ways right 
in that case 
so thats one thing 
another one, this is basic definition 
youve seen we break this 
we write r big r rc plus little r 
thing here, thoughts, 
cross products 
make sure you derive this 
you come there 
there will terms that vanish, 
angular momentum point o 
written as, this is angular 
momentum center mass 
plus angular momentum 
center mass 
kind we energy well 
so im leaving this to you 
to practice go 
make sure you go here to here 
this part, thats orbits class 
youve taken type 
orbits class probably 
you hang momentum orbit 
conserved 
that you get different 
chronic intersections trajectories 
that comes here 
thats cool, 
we dont care that part 
this class is 
attitude spacecraft, right 
translational side, you see 
super particle theorem, you really 
handle separately track happens 
to center mass a spacecraft 
i care happens 
center mass in this class 
so i wheels, i gyroscopics, 
stuff, thats i care 
thats attitude dynamics is 
so instead ho, im going to keep 
this part im going to write hc 
thats angular momentum 
center mass 
that will simply r cross r dots dm 
definitions we right 
so thats good 
so if this is rigid 
people, if this is rigid, 
happens to this derivative 
r dot, goes to zero doesnt 
okay, agrees that 
disagrees that 
rest you asleep, 
okay, confused, thats fair 
im also confused sometimes 
so, you agree that would go to zero 
sorry, name 
ansel 
ansel, thank you 
you think would go to zero 
i thought thats 
a rigid body defined, 
that points dont move 
relative to center mass 
this dot mean 
inaudible 
so this is body 
to track this point, this little 
knob end pen, right 
inertial, i mean an inertially 
fixed spin axis, a rigid body 
is velocity seen you, 
an inertial observer, zero 
right, position vector would center 
mass to this little knob, right 
that vector is clearly 
rotating seen you guys 
so seen frame would this time 
derivative go to zero if is rigid 
body frame 
body frame 
thats key 
so im glad you guys mentioned inertia 
this an easy stumbling block 
everybody starts with, rigid 
dots go to zero 

this is inertial 
derivative velocity 
if rigid, 
means im rotating, 
right hand is always to right 
moving up, down, 
otherwise im a rigid body 
so seen body 
time derivatives zero a rigid body 
thats key thing that 
everybody always misses otherwise 
so good, so if we that, we know 
to this transport theorem, right 
kinematics comes back 
we take body frame derivative, 
we know going to go to zero, 
we love zero 
youre left 
is omega cross r 
okay, good 
we that so r dot is nothing omega 
crossed r i plug that in here 
so i get an r cross omega cross r 
this form is convenient 
i said omega is constant 
seen body 
if rigid, every point in that body 
needs to tumbling rate 
deforming 
in a cross product like this, i cant 
pull middle term out, right 
so i want to make either left 
hand side, right hand side 
i take outside body 
integral, thats im here 
a cross b is a 
thing minus b cross a 
so i flipped it, i r cross 
r cross omega minus sign 
in matrix form, this r cross r 
cross is nothing r tilde r tilde 
again, thats 
minus sign comes 
i take omega 
outside that interval is 
rigid, right, that is key assumption 
anybody recognize this 
term is going to become 
angular momentum turns to 
something times rates 
inertia 
inertia, yeah, 
moment inertia, exactly 
so become inertia tensor 
that youve seen statics 
mechanics classes 
so going to derive this
