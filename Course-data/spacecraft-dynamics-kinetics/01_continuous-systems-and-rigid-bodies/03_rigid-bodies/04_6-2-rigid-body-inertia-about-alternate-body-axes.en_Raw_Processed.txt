one is, 
if we a different body frame 
theres an infinity frames i attach 
to a rigid body a body fixed frame 
in derivation, we assume that 
derivative seen b zero 
theres an infinity frames 
so, 
you will see in real life a lot frames 
there might a docking port frame 
theres a flight frame 
theres a space craft frame 
theres a structure frame 
theres a sensor frame 
theres a star truck frame 
theres a gyro frame 
theres lots frames, right 
a sudden i need inertia 
frame 
i dont want to redo that integrals 
we translate 
this is answer in essence 
you remember we vectors 
so, a twoletter notation, 
this becomes dead simple 
so, if we a vector in nframe 
i want a vector bframe i 
to multiply this times dc 
now, ten serves industry initial 
times like two dimensional vectors 
so, ill still use dcm to mark 
one frame to another, 
i to use dcm twice 
thats this formula shows 
again, im going to derive this 
in a book, you go to that 
a simple one 
two letter notation you 
see this tensor one frame b 
im trying to get tensor 
in different frame f 
i to pre post multiply 
sides times right dcm 
so here fb times fb transpose 
another way to write would fb this 
inertia tensor to b frame times bf, right 
so, left right hand 
side mapping things to f frame, 
you know youre right track 
thats 
so, we used dcm twice 
questions this one 
i assuming many you 
actually seen this 
you may not, 
you catch 
details notes in book 
now, an infinity frames 
we typically like a frame 
that makes inertia tensor 
diagonal especially an analysis 
so, every rigid body 
expressed body fixed 
particular body fixed frame 
that inertia tend to representation 
becomes diagonal, 
i to track three inertia 
terms nine in that whole full thing 
so, analysis, this is very, 
handy, we want to able to this 
in code, we write simulations, 
going to solve 
control problems, we use 
inertia tensor eye in a general way, 
that way requiring 
somebody to found that magic place, 
if you get rid fuel, 
things shifted 
we write in 
a general way 
in codes 
analysis, 
this is a handy thing 
so, we find this 
lets see, this is original one 
this is fb here, 
ive taken this fb transposed 
brought to right 
here right multiplying times fb 
so, that matrix appears here 
here 
you start to carry 
components equate, 
this to 
this basically sums there 
you go ahead 
you will quickly find that this dcm again, 
becomes nothing 
an eigenvalueeigenvector problem 
in fact, you is, 
rows this dcm eigenvectors 
this three three matrix 
representation bodys inertia 
principle inertias, 
thats we call things we 
in diagonal form, nothing 
eigenvalues associated 
to eigenvectors 
so again, 
eigenvectors to form ecm though, 
we need to normal, 
probably hats here 
to unit vectors, right 
to orthogonal 
key result is 
you to righthanded 
this is a big error source 
people right here 
matlab 
gives you three vectors 
idea youre trying to 
so you to check in end is 
you assemble this matrix is that 
v cross to v to give you plus v 
mathlab doesnt check that you 
right 
may give you minus v 
so if you get something thats 
lefthanded, reverse sign one 
you a coordinate 
frame that is righthanded 
this gives you mapping 
current e frame a principle frame f 
whose representation ends 
three diagonal inertias 
you have, good 
so two tricks, 
power access this one, we now, 
we never, we inertia tense 
so we tend to to redo 
that body interval 
you simply nice clean analytic 
mappings to shift origin to shift 
body fix point a body frame 
components taken yes sir 
so f frame is a frame 
inertia tensor is nice 
yes 
if you looked statics mechanics 
books tends to like symmetry axes 
you quickly see thats 
everything bounces 
diagonal terms, vanish 
so, if you that, this pen, if one 
axes lines this symmetry axes 
two orthogonal that 
would give you that kind a frame 
if somebody gives you this weird 
frame this is stuff 
youre putting in a skewed way, 
youre going to this stuff 
so if you this thats body, 
youre going okay, i always make 
a coordinate transformation that this 
becomes diagonal we go there 
this is really nice analysis, 
without loss generality you 
always assume i write rigid body 
tumbling motion in a principle cone form 
in case ill 
three inertias to worry
