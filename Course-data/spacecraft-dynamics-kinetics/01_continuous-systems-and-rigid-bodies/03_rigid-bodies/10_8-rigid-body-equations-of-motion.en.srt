1
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,920
Let's derive the equations
of motion of a rigid body.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,280
We know how to describe
the orientation of a rigid body.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,100
We have Euler angles, we have DCMs.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,920
We've got and CRPs, MIPs.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,520
All these things and
we always have differential equations and

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,210
how they relate back to omega.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,830
If the omega is not just prescribed or

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,490
measured, if you really
have a free tumbling body.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,410
You kick off the satellite
from the rocket.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,920
What happens as it gets released?

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,790
I need to be able to mathematically
predict how omega will evolve, and

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,250
that means I need to find
differential equations for omega.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,100
And what we're going to use always,
for translation,

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,590
we use f equals ma essentially.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,610
That's what it boils down to,
that's one of the forms.

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,180
Here, for rotation,
we always go back to H dot equal to L.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,520
And so, here,
H is taken about the center of mass.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,680
So, we know H dot equal to L holds.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,510
And L is the torque.

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,390
About of all the extra influences about
the center of mass of the system.

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,880
So okay if we know it's the inertia
derivative of H that is equal to

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,800
this equal to this torque.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,830
So we have to be now a little bit
careful in how we derive this.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,990
I've chosen to take a body relative
derivative of this plus now,

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,240
I have two omega b, relative to n,
crossed with that h vector again, right.

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,270
The transport theorem isn't just for
positions and velocities and so forth.

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,000
It's true for any vectorial quantity
that you're differentiating,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
as seen by a rotating frame.

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,840
Angular momentum counts as also a vector.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,900
So this is true.

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,230
Now why did we choose to do
the body frame derivative of this?

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,570
If we do this, and I just use chain rule,

33
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,780
we know h we defined as being
the inertia about point c times omega.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,340
So that's two terms.

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,090
And taking the time derivative
of this chain rule, right?

36
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,880
You get the derivative
of the first term plus

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,910
the derivative of the second term
with the right multiplications.

38
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,730
That's good, now it says this is
going to become equal to i omega dot.

39
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,275
There's two steps in this
one little equal sign.

40
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:12,950
What happens to this part?

41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,820
What happens to body frame
derivative of the inertia tenser?

42
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,110
Jordan.
>> Finishes.

43
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,760
>> Why?
>> Constant in time.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,190
>> So even if this thing is tumbling and
spinning and

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,810
going through space as seen
by you inertial observers.

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,790
The mass distribution keeps changing.

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,530
This point is here, it's up, it's left,
it's flat, it's all over the place right?

48
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,560
That's why doing this derivative on
any inertia tensers inertia frame

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,580
you can do it.

50
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,510
But it becomes a time varying quantity and
you have to track all this stuff.

51
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,200
And it gets harder.

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,970
Whereas the derivative of the inertia
tensor as seen by the body frame

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,360
is trivial if it's rigid.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,800
Because in the mass distribution,
as seen by myself, if I'm rigid and

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,930
I'm rotating and doing stuff, that
mass distribution is exactly the same.

56
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,280
And this is going to vanish.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,770
If you had a deployable mass,

58
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,420
you slowly having your solar panels
from your cube sat and doing something.

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,790
Then some servos that are moving them out.

60
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,770
Well then you would have body relative
derivatives and that's the point

61
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,220
where you include extra terms,
all of a sudden, into these equations.

62
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,960
That's what gives you those extra stuff.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,300
So good, so that term vanished.

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,570
Now here, this dot, Lewis,
implies what type of derivative?

65
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,370
>> It implies an inertial derivative.

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,770
>> Here it's a body frame derivative.

67
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,100
So how did I go from a body frame
derivative to inertial derivative?

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,980
>> Make the vectors
consistent between the two.

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,120
>> Right,
this isn't omega of b relative to n.

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,080
So therefore, the b framed derivative and

71
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,610
the n framed derivative
have to be the same.

72
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,300
That's the one vector where
you find this kind of stuff,

73
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,580
where the derivatives between
the two frames is the same if it's

74
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,210
the angular velocity
between the two frames.

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,100
Because the omega cross
product term always goes to 0.

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,870
Exactly.

77
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,490
So, if you want to be careful,
show all these steps.

78
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,820
In an exam don't just go from here and
that's clearly this.

79
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,090
I'm, you can be missing points.

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,210
I want to see all these sub steps.

81
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,560
Argue every case as you understand,
this is why this goes to zero here.

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,790
And argue correctly why this
other one goes to this, right?

83
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,420
So, good.

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,708
So, the body around this derivative
is just going to be i*omega-dot.

85
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,920
Plus this cross-product term.

86
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,090
So, we're almost there.

87
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,400
Now, you put this together and
you get this differential equation.

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,305
I put this cross-product, H=Ic, so

89
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:33,272
I have omega cross is the same
thing as omega two the h.

90
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,740
That's essentially how we
got to this last step.

91
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,140
I took it over to the right hand side, so

92
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,160
I have i omega that is equal to minus
omega til the i omega plus l c.

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,060
That's the classic orders
rotational equations of motion.

94
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,480
This is what predicts now,

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,250
in your integration,
how does my omega evolve in time.

96
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,780
And for a rigid body,
tumbling like this, there's two aspects.

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,280
One is, this is a gyroscopic.

98
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,559
And you notice, it's omega and omega,
so it's omega squared, is essence.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,710
And it's a second order term.

100
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,320
If you look at linearized departures, you
miss all of this stuff, it just vanishes.

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,430
So, this is the quadratic,
this is your gyroscopics and

102
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,520
you'll see different ways
this manifests itself.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,740
The other part is our external torque,
and that's it and it looks really simple.

104
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,590
Why did this become so
hard so quickly sometimes?

105
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,280
Well, we'll talk about
different ways to write this.

106
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,190
This form, we have a nice, generic i.

107
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,460
So, we can have a principle coordinate
frame as we talked about earlier.

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,010
Or we can have any body fixed frame.

109
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,810
This can be a regular 3 by
3 matrix representation and

110
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,370
it will work, all right.

111
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,730
So, this is a very general format.

112
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,970
So in your integration, I would recommend
this is the equation you should implement

113
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,670
because that way you're solving
always the most general case and

114
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,260
the easier cases become
sub classes of that.

115
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,620
If you pick, sorry Jordan?

116
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,300
>> Quick notational question,
you have sub scripts on l and h but

117
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,730
you don't have them on i?

118
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,490
>> Yeah.

119
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,760
Is that purposeful?

120
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,551
Or wouldn't you [CROSSTALK].

121
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:08,360
>> Just lazy.

122
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,150
>> Same point?

123
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,880
>> I was just lazy.

124
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,720
>> Okay.

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,370
>> If you want to keep track,
I do recommend.

126
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,110
If you want to keep track of them,

127
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,330
this has to be the inertia
about point C in this case.

128
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,780
If you wanted to keep track of that.

129
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,330
For these kind of rigid body dynamics,

130
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,400
people very quickly drop them and
it's just implied.

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,300
But it's a subtlety.

132
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,120
If you have multi body stuff and you take
in moments and torques about you know,

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,670
there's a different body fix point,
there's a docking port point.

134
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,470
Definitely keep track of those suckers,

135
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,390
because it's easy to get it mixed
up when you're adding these things.

136
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,909
So here I just dropped
it out of convenience,

137
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,958
this is, you see this a lot
actually in the notations,

138
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,028
they don't declare themselves as
being lazy, but [SOUND] I don't care.

139
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,750
Okay, so we have this.

140
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,410
Now, let's say we have
a principal corded frame.

141
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,360
As we were hearing earlier,

142
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,310
that means all the matrix representation
of this tensor will just have diagonals.

143
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,390
Lots of off diagonals go to zero.

144
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,130
And the same thing here.

145
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,560
So, omega I omega will just become
i1 omega 1, i2 omega 2, i3 omega 3.

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,620
Really simple.

147
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,210
And then that 10 to the omega 2,

148
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,720
you carry out this math and
you up with these equations.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
So, these are equivalent
to these equations,

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,160
this just assumes I've chosen
principal axes of the body.

151
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,860
Whereas this allows for
any body fixed axises.

152
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,290
So, yes integration wise
this is what you use.

153
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,160
But, in analysis we often find it
much easier to just look at this.

154
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,370
And in fact we will be using these
equations a lot here coming up.

155
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,770
The torque free motion and
discuss different things.

156
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,350
So, you can see the classic
kind of results and L, L 1 2 3,

157
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,340
is basically, this is all taken in
a body fixed frame that's principle.

158
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,400
So, these are the same vector components
with respect to that frame And then we go.

159
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,050
So, you can see now for example,

160
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,870
if you have a axis symmetric body,
we talked earlier about different shapes.

161
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,490
because if you have a cylinder, a rocket
body, a lot of things in space tend to be

162
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,630
barrels because everything
fits in a rocket.

163
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,010
Well the rocket itself is kind of a barrel
shape, it has an axis of symmetry.

164
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,440
In that case two principle
inertias will always be equal.

165
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,050
So since in here the gyroscopics are all
these differences of two principle

166
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,890
inertias you know right away [INAUDIBLE]
metric bodies one of these gyroscopic

167
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,850
terms is going to vanish right and
that's an insight to have.

168
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,400
I'll see this in a few
cases that we'll look at.

169
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,060
Now let's talk about how
to integrate these things.

170
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,440
One question I have for you is, does,

171
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,740
we've derived differential
nematic equation, just MRPs.

172
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,970
We know sigma odd is equal to one over
four b times is omega vector right.

173
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,980
So omega appears defiantly
going to need that.

174
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,780
Otherwise we just need sigma Here,
I need omega, omega, the inertia,

175
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,370
it's a rigid body so with relative to B
frame, this is a fixed inertia tensor.

176
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,860
And then, you have external torques.

177
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,760
Nowhere in here do you see sigmas, or
quaternions, or any attitude measure.

178
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,160
So if I have two differential equations,
the question then becomes can you

179
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,750
integrate just omegas first and
then do the attitude?

180
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,985
Or should you aways be integrating
omegas in attitudes simultaneously?

181
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:24,425
[SOUND], I see some wrinkles now,
okay, good.

182
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,100
Can we do it?

183
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,230
The sigma starts omega.

184
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,840
So, you know you can't do sigmas first,
but I could do omegas first,

185
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,620
integrate forward and then use that answer
and then separately integrate omegas.

186
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,170
What do you think?

187
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
Andre?

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
>> I'd say simultaneously.

189
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,160
>> Because?

190
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,530
But you delivered the question.

191
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,770
>> I know. [LAUGH] >> Hopefully you're
good enough at by now where you know

192
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm asking you a trick question.

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,160
And B, the gut feeling probably is I know
simultaneous should definitely work.

194
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,410
Separating, now you need to argue
a defense why was that valid, right.

195
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,980
There's simple answers, definitely.

196
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,180
I would also do it simultaneously,
but why.

197
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,250
Is it ever okay to just integrate omegas?

198
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,330
And then do that.

199
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,210
Daniel.
>> Don't have torques.

200
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,910
>> Okay.
Torque free motion.

201
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,180
If I have torque free motion,
I don't have my that works only here.

202
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,640
If I don't have the torque, absolutely.

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
You could just integrate omega.

204
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,230
Now in my codes, let me just say upfront,
I always do it simultaneously.

205
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,300
Just, that's the most general answer,
right.

206
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,170
And I don't want to write code for
these cases when I have no torque or

207
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,200
here I have torque.

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,190
If I do them simultaneously,
it doesn't matter if I have torque or not.

209
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,620
But absolutely, you could do that but
let's say we do have torque.

210
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,270
I have some thrusters I'm firing.

211
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,940
There's two thrusters,
four thrusters, they're firing.

212
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,410
They're producing a torque.

213
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,689
Can you still integrate the omegas first
and then apply them to the sigma dots?

214
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Need to have a situation where your
angular rates aren't coupled to

215
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
your actual angle, itself, right?

216
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,180
>> Well, yes, the angular
accelerations we're worried about.

217
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,170
It's omega dot.

218
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,360
Does omega dot couple with the angles?

219
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,350
This will never make
it couple with angles.

220
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,090
This never makes it couple with angles.

221
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,730
The only term that could make us
couple with attitudes Is this.

222
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,460
My example with thrusters.

223
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,170
If I'm firing pairs of thrusters
that produce a torque and

224
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,750
spin it,
does that matter now on the altitude?

225
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,750
The thrusters are body fixed,
so I get this torque.

226
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,720
If I spun around, then I thrust again,
relative to the body,

227
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,440
you always get in the same torque,
it's actually just going to show up

228
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,820
a bunch of constants,
no attitude dependence that works.

229
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,950
Give me a torque that
is attitude dependant.

230
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,860
>> Gradient.

231
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,620
Spencer.

232
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,680
>> Solo radiation pressure.

233
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,470
>> Solo radiation pressure.

234
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,030
Right.
Daniel,

235
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,610
talking about atmospheric drag,
those effects.

236
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,830
Gravity gradients.

237
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,620
There's all these kind of disturbances,
often environmental.

238
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,290
All of a sudden, you need the attitude.

239
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,400
And then, whoa, now it matters.

240
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,950
When we do another thing
[INAUDIBLE] as humans,

241
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,060
we will be developing feedback control,
and even the simplest form the torque,

242
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,480
we come up with a thruster control torque,
which is minus a gain times attitude error

243
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,600
minus a gain time rate error or something
very simplistic like that, right?

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,400
And all of a sudden, through our
algorithm, we're coupling in our attitude.

245
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,740
because we want to point here,
not just come to rest over here, right?

246
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,000
And the thruster firings will
be a function of attitude.

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,310
So yes, so when you look at these things
and it's a good PHD prelim oral questions.

248
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,030
There are ways we can one way decouple
them and solve omega separately and

249
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,490
doing that parallel as Andre was saying.

250
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,010
Absolutely your gut feeling is right.

251
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,790
That's probably the way
it always will work and

252
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,830
in fact that's how you should program it.

253
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,280
And the way attitude couples into it,
thought, is only through this part,

254
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,840
which could be environmental effects
like drag, SRP, gravity gradient or

255
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
also we could external torques.

256
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,560
That's our control solution, all right?

257
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,210
That's what's producing these things.

258
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,649
And that's where attitude
couples in as well.
