1
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,580
If we make it rigid.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,130
We've already jumped ahead
a little bit which is good.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,310
Sometimes just rearranging your order
helps things sink in more, right?

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,980
If it's rigid,
what is the key differentiation?

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,350
So Sheila was on the right track earlier
that it's all about these derivatives,

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,290
especially this little r dot.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,170
And if it's rigid, then the derivative of

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,190
this vector as seen by
the body frame has to be 0.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,960
So you just end up with omega cross r,
right?

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,130
If it's not rigid, then this little mass
particle is maybe deploying, it's moving,

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,900
it's wobbling, it's doing something.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,170
And you have extra turns.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,570
That's, in fact,
what you'd have to include.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,820
Now you plug this in, and
we only focus about this one.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,140
You can separate this also for rigid body,
like this plus this other term.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm not going to do that here.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,273
But in the end, the angle momentum about

18
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:03,853
the center of mass ended up being this

19
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:09,050
minus r tilde, r tilde, dm times omega.

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,408
What did we call this
big bracketed term here?

21
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,021
>> Is that the inertia tensor?

22
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,780
>> That's the inertia tensor.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,890
And I like using the word tensor versus
matrix, because there's a difference.

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,515
We have a position vector but

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:27,065
then we use a matrix to define the vector
components with respect to some frame.

26
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:31,762
So the matrix represents a vector but
the vectors you can fundamentally just add

27
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:35,670
vectors and add arrows and
you don't have to assign frames.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,596
Same thing here.

29
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:41,275
Now in this tilde notation, this is
basically the cross product operator

30
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:44,710
which will be the vector equivalent of it,
right?

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,440
You have to make sure that r tilde.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,165
You have to take this vector, r,
with respect to some frame, the B frame,

33
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,150
as an example.

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,350
This would be in the B frame,
that's what you measure.

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,300
Now it's apples and apples and
you can do all your matrix math.

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,991
You wouldn't have this in the C frame and
this in the B frame.

37
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,188
And then you'd be mixing frames and
it just wouldn't work out well, all right?

38
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:09,920
So we have to do the integration by
picking a body frame and then we get this.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,990
And also little r is defined relative
to this body's center of mass.

40
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,890
That's how we defined little r.

41
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,470
What if we have a different point?

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,420
Maybe this thing isn't spinning
about its center of mass, but

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,010
it's pivoted to an end of an arm,
and it's pivoting like this.

44
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,610
All of a sudden,

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,480
I need the inertia about this endpoint,
not about the center point, right?

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
Do we have to redo this
integration over and over again?

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,652
No, right?

48
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,600
So there's formulas on how to do this.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,740
This, in essence,
is my inertia tensor times omega.

50
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,700
So written like this,

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,050
treat this as a completely
coordinate-independent formulation.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,636
When you're actually numerically evaluated
in some program like MATLAB or C or

53
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,690
something.

54
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,150
You have to make sure
it's the same frames.

55
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,440
But when we derive controls,

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
we'll just write it this way and
not assign frames yet.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,065
That's the bookkeeping
you do at the very end.

58
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,590
So good, that was the inertia tensor.

59
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,980
So let's wrap up some final things.

60
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,880
What if we have a,
let's just flip the order.

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,910
Let's do attitudes first,
just to mix it up.

62
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,320
What if we have a different orientation?

63
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,238
You have the inertia tensor
given to you in B frames but

64
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:27,404
I want the inertia tensor
in frame components.

65
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:30,983
I don't have to redo all
those body intervals again.

66
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:32,841
Once you have them, you're good.

67
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:37,240
>> Do you have to left multiply and
right multiply?

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,715
>> Okay, so
give me the two letters of each DCM.

69
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:45,729
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> So it would be BE,

70
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,515
right, or no EB, sorry, backwards.

71
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,980
>> Won't let me erase.

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,649
Okay, EB, and the next one is?

73
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,647
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Or B.

74
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,905
I like to remember it this way actually.

75
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:06,130
because this way if I know BE, great,
then have to transpose this one.

76
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,200
If I know EB, fine,
you have to transpose that one, right?

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,350
But it's basically if this is in the B
frame, then it's a two-dimensional.

78
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,540
Think of tensors like
two-dimensional vectors.

79
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,850
So instead of using the DCM once,
it's a 2D thing, you have to use it twice.

80
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,810
And you're absolutely correct,
it's a left and a right multiplication.

81
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,740
And when you bump them up like that
the letters B should match up.

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,750
This is all on the B frame.

83
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,080
And then what's on the outside
everything's being mapped to the E frame

84
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,520
and you get a inertia
tensor in the E frame.

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,910
So a different rule of mnemonics trick
that you can help to remember this stuff.

86
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,230
Definitely use it twice.

87
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,150
Good, so that's how we avoid, once we
have this in some body fixed frame,

88
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,860
we can easily map it to any
other body fixed frame.

89
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,590
I will use this trick several times,
especially when deriving variable speed,

90
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,370
c and g equations of motion, and so forth.

91
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,320
So what do I mean by
a principal coordinate frame?

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,260
Is it Tosh?

93
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,300
What does that mean?

94
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:05,106
>> The [INAUDIBLE]?

95
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:10,188
>> Mm-hm, so let's say F is principal.

96
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,450
So what about the diagonals?

97
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,030
>> Of the principal.

98
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,840
>> Let's just call this I1, I2, I3.

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,984
What about the off diagonals?

100
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,246
>> They're 0.

101
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,910
>> So, they're 0.

102
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,530
If this is a principal frame,

103
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,940
you have a coordinate frame such
that you get a nice diagonal form.

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,710
Chuck, can we always do this?

105
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,710
Or are there assumptions on
the shape that allow us to do this?

106
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,240
It's a rigid system.

107
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,160
>> Yes, you can always do it.

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,490
>> You can always do this.

109
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,130
That's why for analysis very often
you see papers or even our own stuff.

110
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,440
We need to start out with
assuming it's a principal frame.

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,506
because instead of having
nine elements to track and

112
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:06,800
now with symmetry it's actually six, but
still it's about I can go down to three.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,210
Three principal inertias fully define
the mass distribution of a system.

114
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,010
Without loss of generality
we can always do this.

115
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,350
In the code, though, we typically solve,

116
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,862
actually we do control problems
that include the full tensor.

117
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:20,960
Because in real life they will
never give you the mass balance.

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,470
You may start out with a frame that's
perfect, and at the very last minute

119
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,937
astronaut A and B switch places, and
next thing you know your CG's offset.

120
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:31,410
Crap, my inertia tensor's now
fully populated, darn astronauts!

121
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,920
So there's always something.

122
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,610
So in the code,
we want to have formulations and

123
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,047
controls that handle any inertia tensor.

124
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,115
But we want to also realize for
analysis and

125
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:43,170
we design it typically they're diagonal or
nearly diagonal.

126
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,600
The off diagonal terms
might be very small.

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,870
We want to have solutions that work for
everything.

128
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,505
So good, this is symmetric
matrix from the definition.

129
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:58,720
Could you have inertias, I1 = 800,

130
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,452
I2 = 20, and I3 = 50.

131
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm just using generic units.

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm not throwing in anything particular,
they're just consistent numbers.

133
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,910
Is that possible?

134
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,500
So we didn't discuss, I'm just curious.

135
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,040
Everybody here has seen
inertia tensors before.

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Are there constraints in
the principal inertia values?

137
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,000
You find lots of publications
that they publish stuff,

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,290
where they throw in inertias like this.

139
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,110
And as an editor I can go,
hey, wait a minute.

140
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,330
This is a non-physical system.

141
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,050
There are limits to how
different your inertias can be.

142
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,791
In fact there's an inequality
constraint that says, the I,

143
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:50,186
principal inertia + the J of principal
inertia have to be greater than or

144
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,430
equal to the kth principal inertia.

145
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,140
So if you sum any two of them,
you have to be bigger than the third,

146
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,230
whatever the third is.

147
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,250
And if you go, and
let's just look at that.

148
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,950
Here we go.

149
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,984
If you look in this,
this is the I1, I2, I3.

150
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,510
These off diagonals are all 0, right?

151
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,160
So I1 i r2 squared and 3 squared.

152
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,790
This one is r1 squared and 3 squared.

153
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,200
So summed up, I get r1 squared
2 squared and 2r3 squared.

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,990
Compared to the third, it's just r1
squared and 2 squared plus an r3 squared.

155
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,530
That squared term can at best be 0,
which means they're equal.

156
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,150
But if anything else, it's going to have
to have something bigger, all right?

157
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,430
So when you set up inertias, be careful
that you actually use a realistic example

158
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,130
where the sum of 82 principal
inertias has to be bigger than or

159
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,520
equal in a limiting case to the third one.

160
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,150
So there's different kind of
properties that you can pick up here.

161
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,050
So good, we have that.

162
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,550
Now we know how to do this.

163
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,160
How do we go from,
what's the relationship?

164
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,601
If you have a regular 3x3 matrix and

165
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,843
you're trying to find
the principal inertias.

166
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:11,675
How do you go from the 3x3 tensor matrix
representation to the three principals?

167
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,410
What was back row scratching your head.

168
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,310
What's your name?

169
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,662
>> Mark.
>> Mark, thank you.

170
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,750
>> Can you repeat the question please?

171
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,370
>> Sorry?
>> Can you repeat the question please?

172
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,300
>> How do I go from a 3x3 inertia
tensor representation to a diagonal?

173
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,683
How do I find the principal values of-
>> You have to find the eigenvalues and

174
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:31,670
the eigenvectors.

175
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,920
>> Exactly, right?

176
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,120
So you have to find eigenvalues,
eigenvectors of the system.

177
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,851
And the eigenvalues,of the 3x3,
they are all of the principal inertias,

178
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,070
that's cool.

179
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,470
And then the associated eigenvectors
are the axes of that principal inertia.

180
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,350
And are relative to the body,
it turns out.

181
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,654
This is a principal axis, and

182
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:53,920
this is a principal axis,
then you'd have a third one, right?

183
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,010
Now are these eigenvectors
always going to be unique?

184
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,680
Jordan, think of a cylinder.

185
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,460
If you get this math,

186
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,890
I can give you a nice 3x3 matrix of
a cylinder with some weird skewed frame.

187
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,120
You find principal inertias.

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,280
If it's a cylinder, what should
you expect now, all of a sudden?

189
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,670
>> Expect one to be up the axis and
two to be in that, in any plane.

190
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,930
>> Right.
>> Anywhere in that plane.

191
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,230
>> So you will have a repeated eigenvalues
set orthoganol to the symmetry axis.

192
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,930
The inertia of a cylinder about this axis
or this axis is just going to be the same.

193
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,540
So you get a repeated eigenvalue.

194
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,750
And the plane is unique in that case,
but not necessarily the values, right?

195
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
So this is how these
things all relate again.

196
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,323
And these matrices are symmetric,
turns out they're also symmetric

197
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,206
definite because the principal
inertias have to be positive.

198
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,370
You would never have
a negative principal inertia.

199
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,660
It just doesn't make physical sense.

200
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,930
So, okay, so good properties there, good!

201
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,580
Now, the last thing we want to review is,
what if we have a different point?

202
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,710
We have the inertia tensor about c,

203
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,170
I want the inertia tensor about a point q.

204
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,205
How do I go from this to this, without
redoing all the math, all the integration?

205
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,262
Kevin.

206
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:18,010
>> You need add,
The mass of the whole body times,

207
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,690
Just like the vector
between the two points?

208
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,234
>> Yeah, so let me just say

209
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:36,223
that c relative to q,

210
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:40,389
they're close.

211
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,650
It's usually a parallel axis there, right?

212
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,010
If you do it for
1d rotation it was always easy,

213
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,610
it was something the inertia about
the center of mass plus the distance.

214
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,852
So if I have the inertia
about the center of mass,

215
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:52,724
I want the inertia about this endpoint.

216
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:59,530
I do mass times distance squared,
it's squared I think, that I get there.

217
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,570
This is essentially mass
times distance squared,

218
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,010
and this is the distance between
those two points that you'd have.

219
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,220
It doesn't have to be an inertia point,

220
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,375
it could be another point as well,
like base point.

221
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,451
Now what are some the trickeries in here?

222
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,640
This is typically given to you in the Q.

223
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Let's say this is your spacecraft queue,
Star Trek, right?

224
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,956
Anybody remember Q?

225
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:18,750
That was one of the characters in there.

226
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,510
So in his spacecraft,
Q lives in a very Q-centric world.

227
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,469
So this Rc relative to Q is
usually given to you in a Q frame.

228
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:36,100
This stuff is probably given
to you in the body frame.

229
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,390
Now before I actually can do this math,

230
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,200
what do you have to do
with these quantities?

231
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,450
>> You have to change them.

232
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,270
Body frame to Q frame.

233
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,550
I'm sure, but body frame to Q frame.

234
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,330
>> So you have to map this to the Q,
is that the only way to do this math?

235
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,708
Warda, or is there another option?

236
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,561
You could, because this isn't the Q,
everything is kind of in the Q space,

237
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,800
you'd have to make this into Q.

238
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
What else could we do?

239
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:13,300
This isn't a B.

240
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,430
Is there any way you can
make this in the B frame?

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,430
Tony, what would you do?

242
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,358
>> Do a rotation matrix on the R.

243
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:26,867
>> You can also just say, well,
so I know this in the Q frame or

244
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:30,910
I can also find c relative
to q in the B frame.

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,747
Which is BC times R C relative
to Q in the Q frame, right?

246
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:39,810
If you did this now you plug
these in here, and then this.

247
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,670
Just make sure it's consistent.

248
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,292
I didn't say we have to have
the answer in B or Q components.

249
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,300
You can do either.

250
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,200
Well, you can do one and then map
the answer back into the frame you want.

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,427
That works as well, if it's a third
frame that's not either C or Q or B.

252
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:57,250
So you can see lots of
different ways this goes.

253
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,040
This is the general math but
if this is the coordinate independent way,

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,760
a coordinate frame
independent way to write it.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,520
When you evaluate it, still make
sure you have all the right stuff.

256
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,287
Otherwise, nothing works.

257
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:09,963
Okay, good.
