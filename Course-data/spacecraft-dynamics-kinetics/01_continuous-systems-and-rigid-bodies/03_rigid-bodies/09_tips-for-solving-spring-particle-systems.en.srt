1
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:10,870
Another one, I just wanted to highlight,
because this comes up a lot, is this one.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,700
This problem here.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,390
Mass over two.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,459
We've done everything in class that you
need to get these equations of motion.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,785
So when we're getting equations of
motion from mechanical systems,

6
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,936
what type of fundamental
properties do we use?

7
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,687
Lewis.

8
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:33,236
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> No.

9
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:36,180
Not to get equations of motion.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,050
We use conservation of
energy if I'm looking for

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,000
relationships between rates and states.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,320
But you can't use conservation of energy
to get your second order differential

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,915
equations.

14
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,910
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Okay.

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,010
So there's F equals mass times
some acceleration vector.

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,510
Right?

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,419
When does this hold?

18
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,576
>> Mass.

19
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:05,006
>> Okay, mass constant, what else?

20
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,612
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> This has to be inertial derivatives, so

21
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:12,050
this r vector has to be taken
relative to an inertial point.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,807
And you take inertial time derivatives,
yeah, when else?

23
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,320
>> It's constant?

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,496
>> Well, yeah mass is constant, yep.

25
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,210
Does it apply to this pen?

26
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,779
Russell, you're saying yes.

27
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,900
>> It's constant mass.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,780
>> It's constant mass.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,652
So it is good for rigid bodies?

30
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:41,778
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> [LAUGH]

31
00:01:41,778 --> 00:01:44,222
>> [LAUGH]

32
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,472
>> Okay.

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:53,304
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> You're applying what to it?

34
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:57,270
[INAUDIBLE]
>> [LAUGH]

35
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,020
>> I'm getting wet there's so

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,640
much back paddling here.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,130
Okay.
>> [LAUGH]

38
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,860
>> So yes to this to what.

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,060
This is Are made.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,690
Come on, how hard is that right?

41
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,089
>> What was your question?
>> People write whole PhDs on

42
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:07,780
this equation.

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,090
Anybody doing Orbitz,
you can tell your parents that's it.

44
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,680
I spent five years working
on this equation you know.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,190
That's it.

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,730
F = MA.

47
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,100
How hard is it?

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,960
But it is hard.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,420
It gets very quickly hard.

50
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,510
So where does it apply to?

51
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,370
And I'm saying this pen.

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,110
Can we use F = MA on this pen?

53
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,210
Andre, what do you think?

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,200
>> Absolutely.

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,250
>> Okay, good answer.

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,069
Now second part is what?

57
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:30,676
>> What?

58
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:31,459
>> Why?

59
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,631
>> [LAUGH]
>> You want to model the trajectory of

60
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:35,760
the pen or something?

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,670
>> [LAUGH] What part of the pen?

62
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,850
I need it more specifically?

63
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,140
>> Center of mass.

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,460
>> Center of mass.

65
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,030
Right.

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,490
What did we call that theorem?

67
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,890
>> Super particle theorem?

68
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,640
>> Super particle theorem, right?

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,790
So F= MA holds for
the super particle theorem.

70
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,640
That's, in fact, how you do your whole
Problem, and you just basically ignore

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,270
the rest of the mass distribution,
you say the space station is a point.

72
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,560
Which is a decent assumption for
some analysis,

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,510
obviously not a good assumption for
other analysis.

74
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,203
Depends on what you're doing again.

75
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:09,130
So good, so this could be true for
a whole system not just for a point mass.

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,490
We typically have it written for
point masses.

77
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,405
If it's a super particle theorem,
what is F then it that case?

78
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:18,110
>> External forces?

79
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,437
>> A single external force?

80
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:20,042
>> The sum of all.

81
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:23,930
>> The sum of all the external influences
that happened on the system, right.

82
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,214
So that's important because you can
actually use that in this system to argue

83
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:34,426
things about are there any external
forces on this dynamical systems?

84
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,164
And if you ask what does that mean,
and if not,

85
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:38,000
what does that mean under
center of mass motion?

86
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,730
But that's one of them, so this works for
a system, but it also works for

87
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,540
a particle.

88
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't forget the very basics.

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,370
You can do F=MA on a particle as well,
and this also holds, and

90
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,749
you have to write this relative
to any inertial point,

91
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,430
I'm just going to give you the tape,
it doesn't have to be some point dot here.

92
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,658
There's a much more convenient inertial
point in this problem that you could write

93
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,250
everything relative to.

94
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,130
And now things become very simple.

95
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,410
But what's the other
equation that we've used?

96
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,010
So we have F=MA on particles on
the center of math if it's a system.

97
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,700
And in this case you could do either.

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,300
You could do free body diagram and
do on that or what else?

99
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,045
>> H.=L.

100
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:16,910
>> H.=L.

101
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,710
All right.

102
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,400
And that also works but if you say H.=L,

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,561
you're taking points about where?

104
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,720
It's like moments talk about which point?

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,990
>> Well you can pick the point right?

106
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,389
But the center of mass is
where you're doing it about.

107
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:37,290
[CROSSTALK]
>> You can use center of mass.

108
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,619
Is there different points you could.

109
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,959
It could be an inertial point,
right, and either.

110
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,730
And you can play with that.

111
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,070
And then you write up your momentum.

112
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,780
Do this, or you can do these equations.

113
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,030
Or you will find maybe
combinations of this.

114
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,056
You have to have enough, how many
degrees of freedom does the system have?

115
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:58,816
Two, the rules of freedom is
how many independence states

116
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:02,190
do you need to fully describe
the current configuration, right.

117
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,080
And the r, there's I think
this here has a radius r and

118
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,330
then you have some angle theta.

119
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,570
So in the end you need differential
equations for both of these, right.

120
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,065
So you're going to have to use these
vector equations and break them up.

121
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:20,260
There's many different ways
you can solve this, all right.

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,550
But this is something where I'm looking
for you to apply these very principles.

123
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,130
There's lots of easy ways you can do it,
but breaking everything down, and

124
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,160
sines and cosines galore, I'm giving
you a rotating frame for a reason.

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,190
I want you to use that E theta direction.

126
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,950
Write it that way, it'll give you
an answer that's actually really,

127
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,040
really fast and compact.

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,140
That's what you're looking for.

129
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,360
Once you see how to apply those
principles it goes very, very quickly.
