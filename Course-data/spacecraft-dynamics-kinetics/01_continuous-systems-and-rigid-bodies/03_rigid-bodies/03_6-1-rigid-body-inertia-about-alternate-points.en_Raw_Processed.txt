so theres two aspects 
either we need to a different point 
taking moments 
taking a different corner frame 
hopefully youve 
seen this 
going to go 
this pretty quickly 
book derives this, 
if you want to look this steps, 
im going to give you answer 
so if you inertia tensor 
center mass 
thats typically a statics 
mechanics book gives you 
you this block, 
this cone, this panel, right 
gives you x, y, 
z coordinates, assumes that things 
lined symmetry, gives you 
this answer, basically, in that form 
reason this panel, 
you dont need inertia, moments 
center mass, 
going to attached to a spacecraft 
arm is panel 
panel center mass is here, 
spacecraft center mass 
might somewhere else 
i get moments here 
you could redo integrals 
this parallel axis theorem basically 
allows you to take moments 
points 
way this is written is you need 
inertia tenser center 
mass, thats always going to 
smallest inertia youll have, 
away 
going to get bigger 
you get mass times distance squared, 
thats probably you remember 
parallaxes theorem 
fixed axis rotation 
if this is inertia center 
a sudden im spinning 
endpoint 
you would that distance squared times 
mass that you to add to inertia 
this is a d version that 
total mass, 
i need to know is that shift 
so im taking moments o 
theres a vector going 
o to center mass 
im calling that one rc 
ive got a tilde form 
to avoid a minus sign so 
plus mass times distance squared 
essentially in a tilde formulation 
so thats we can, 
we dont to reevaluate 
inertia tenser every time we 
a different moment point 
you use this theorem 
heres one subtlety 
people often trip 
in here again, we mention tensers 
you numerically value a three pathway 
matrices 
you to pick a coordinate frame 
make sure youre adding things 
in coordinate frame 
that includes this 
so rc tildes better 
broken in 
n frame if this is given in n frame 
if this is given in b frame, 
you to write rc in b frame 
rcs often given in frame 
you a, cube set, 
goes to space station 
you probably cube set inertia 
center mass 
in space, 
thats in cube set frame 
where, is in space station 
typically expressed to you in a space 
station coordinate frame 
right, relative to space station 
you put that cube set this launch 
location 
well, you to course 
use a dcm to map vectors 
a space station frame to body 
frame you apply this stuff 
thats one step i often see missed 
right, so make sure if you this 
math everythings taken respect to 
frame
