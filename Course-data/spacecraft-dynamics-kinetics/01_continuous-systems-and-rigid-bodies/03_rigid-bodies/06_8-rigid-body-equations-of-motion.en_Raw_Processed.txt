lets derive equations 
motion a rigid body 
we know to describe 
orientation a rigid body 
we euler angles, we dcms 
weve got crps, mips 
things 
we always differential equations 
relate back to omega 
if omega is prescribed 
measured, if you really 
a free tumbling body 
you kick satellite 
rocket 
happens gets released 
i need to able to mathematically 
predict omega will evolve, 
that means i need to find 
differential equations omega 
going to use always, 
translation, 
we use f equals ma essentially 
thats boils to, 
thats one forms 
here, rotation, 
we always go back to h dot equal to l 
so, here, 
h is taken center mass 
so, we know h dot equal to l holds 
l is torque 
extra influences 
center mass system 
so okay if we know inertia 
derivative h that is equal to 
this equal to this torque 
so we to a little bit 
careful in we derive this 
ive chosen to take a body relative 
derivative this plus now, 
i two omega b, relative to n, 
crossed that h vector again, right 
transport theorem isnt 
positions velocities so forth 
true vectorial quantity 
that youre differentiating, 
seen a rotating frame 
angular momentum counts also a vector 
so this is true 
we choose to 
body frame derivative this 
if we this, i use chain rule, 
we know h we defined 
inertia point c times omega 
so thats two terms 
taking time derivative 
this chain rule, right 
you get derivative 
first term plus 
derivative second term 
right multiplications 
thats good, says this is 
going to become equal to i omega dot 
theres two steps in this 
one little equal sign 
happens to this part 
happens to body frame 
derivative inertia tenser 
jordan 
finishes 

constant in time 
so even if this thing is tumbling 
spinning 
going space seen 
you inertial observers 
mass distribution keeps changing 
this point is here, up, left, 
flat, place right 
thats this derivative 
inertia tensers inertia frame 
you 
becomes a time varying quantity 
you to track this stuff 
gets harder 
whereas derivative inertia 
tensor seen body frame 
is trivial if rigid 
in mass distribution, 
seen myself, if im rigid 
im rotating stuff, that 
mass distribution is exactly 
this is going to vanish 
if you a deployable mass, 
you slowly solar panels 
cube sat something 
servos that moving 
well you would body relative 
derivatives thats point 
you include extra terms, 
a sudden, equations 
thats gives you extra stuff 
so good, so that term vanished 
here, this dot, lewis, 
implies type derivative 
implies an inertial derivative 
here a body frame derivative 
so i go a body frame 
derivative to inertial derivative 
make vectors 
consistent between two 
right, 
this isnt omega b relative to n 
so therefore, b framed derivative 
n framed derivative 
to 
thats one vector 
you find this kind stuff, 
derivatives between 
two frames is if 
angular velocity 
between two frames 
omega cross 
product term always goes to 
exactly 
so, if you want to careful, 
show steps 
in an exam dont go here 
thats clearly this 
im, you missing points 
i want to see sub steps 
argue every case you understand, 
this is this goes to zero here 
argue correctly this 
one goes to this, right 
so, good 
so, body around this derivative 
is going to iomegadot 
plus this crossproduct term 
so, almost there 
now, you put this together 
you get this differential equation 
i put this crossproduct, hic, so 
i omega cross is 
thing omega two h 
thats essentially we 
got to this last step 
i took to right hand side, so 
i i omega that is equal to minus 
omega til i omega plus l c 
thats classic orders 
rotational equations motion 
this is predicts now, 
in integration, 
omega evolve in time 
a rigid body, 
tumbling like this, theres two aspects 
one is, this is a gyroscopic 
you notice, omega omega, 
so omega squared, is essence 
a second order term 
if you look linearized departures, you 
miss this stuff, vanishes 
so, this is quadratic, 
this is gyroscopics 
youll see different ways 
this manifests 
part is external torque, 
thats looks really simple 
this become so 
hard so quickly sometimes 
well, well talk 
different ways to write this 
this form, we a nice, generic i 
so, we a principle coordinate 
frame we talked earlier 
we body fixed frame 
this a regular 
matrix representation 
will work, right 
so, this is a general format 
so in integration, i would recommend 
this is equation you implement 
that way youre solving 
always general case 
easier cases become 
sub classes that 
if you pick, sorry jordan 
quick notational question, 
you sub scripts l h 
you dont i 
yeah 
is that purposeful 
wouldnt you crosstalk 
lazy 
point 
i lazy 
okay 
if you want to keep track, 
i recommend 
if you want to keep track them, 
this to inertia 
point c in this case 
if you wanted to keep track that 
kind rigid body dynamics, 
people quickly drop 
implied 
a subtlety 
if you multi body stuff you take 
in moments torques you know, 
theres a different body fix point, 
theres a docking port point 
definitely keep track suckers, 
easy to get mixed 
youre adding things 
so here i dropped 
convenience, 
this is, you see this a lot 
actually in notations, 
dont declare 
lazy, sound i dont care 
okay, so we this 
now, lets say we 
a principal corded frame 
we hearing earlier, 
that means matrix representation 
this tensor will diagonals 
lots diagonals go to zero 
thing here 
so, omega i omega will become 
i omega , i omega , i omega 
really simple 
that to omega , 
you carry this math 
you equations 
so, equivalent 
to equations, 
this assumes ive chosen 
principal axes body 
whereas this allows 
body fixed axises 
so, yes integration wise 
this is you use 
but, in analysis we often find 
much easier to look this 
in fact we will using 
equations a lot here coming 
torque free motion 
discuss different things 
so, you see classic 
kind results l, l , 
is basically, this is taken in 
a body fixed frame thats principle 
so, vector components 
respect to that frame we go 
so, you see example, 
if you a axis symmetric body, 
we talked earlier different shapes 
if you a cylinder, a rocket 
body, a lot things in space tend to 
barrels everything 
fits in a rocket 
well rocket is kind a barrel 
shape, an axis symmetry 
in that case two principle 
inertias will always equal 
so since in here gyroscopics 
differences two principle 
inertias you know right away inaudible 
metric bodies one gyroscopic 
terms is going to vanish right 
thats an insight to 
ill see this in a few 
cases that well look 
lets talk 
to integrate things 
one question i you is, does, 
weve derived differential 
nematic equation, mrps 
we know sigma odd is equal to one 
four b times is omega vector right 
so omega appears defiantly 
going to need that 
otherwise we need sigma here, 
i need omega, omega, inertia, 
a rigid body so relative to b 
frame, this is a fixed inertia tensor 
then, you external torques 
nowhere in here you see sigmas, 
quaternions, attitude measure 
so if i two differential equations, 
question becomes you 
integrate omegas first 
attitude 
you aways integrating 
omegas in attitudes simultaneously 
sound, i see wrinkles now, 
okay, good 
we 
sigma starts omega 
so, you know you cant sigmas first, 
i could omegas first, 
integrate forward use that answer 
separately integrate omegas 
you think 
andre 
id say simultaneously 

you delivered question 
i know laugh hopefully youre 
good enough you know 
im asking you a trick question 
b, gut feeling probably is i know 
simultaneous definitely work 
separating, you need to argue 
a defense that valid, right 
theres simple answers, definitely 
i would also simultaneously, 

is ever okay to integrate omegas 
that 
daniel 
dont torques 
okay 
torque free motion 
if i torque free motion, 
i dont that works here 
if i dont torque, absolutely 
you could integrate omega 
in codes, let say upfront, 
i always simultaneously 
just, thats general answer, 
right 
i dont want to write code 
cases i torque 
here i torque 
if i simultaneously, 
doesnt matter if i torque 
absolutely, you could that 
lets say we torque 
i thrusters im firing 
theres two thrusters, 
four thrusters, theyre firing 
theyre producing a torque 
you still integrate omegas first 
apply to sigma dots 
need to a situation 
angular rates arent coupled to 
actual angle, itself, right 
well, yes, angular 
accelerations worried 
omega dot 
omega dot couple angles 
this will never make 
couple angles 
this never makes couple angles 
term that could make us 
couple attitudes is this 
example thrusters 
if im firing pairs thrusters 
that produce a torque 
spin it, 
that matter altitude 
thrusters body fixed, 
so i get this torque 
if i spun around, i thrust again, 
relative to body, 
you always get in torque, 
actually going to show 
a bunch constants, 
attitude dependence that works 
give a torque that 
is attitude dependant 
gradient 
spencer 
solo radiation pressure 
solo radiation pressure 
right 
daniel, 
talking atmospheric drag, 
effects 
gravity gradients 
theres kind disturbances, 
often environmental 
a sudden, you need attitude 
then, whoa, matters 
we another thing 
inaudible humans, 
we will developing feedback control, 
even simplest form torque, 
we come a thruster control torque, 
is minus a gain times attitude error 
minus a gain time rate error something 
simplistic like that, right 
a sudden, 
algorithm, coupling in attitude 
we want to point here, 
come to rest here, right 
thruster firings will 
a function attitude 
so yes, so you look things 
a good phd prelim oral questions 
there ways we one way decouple 
solve omega separately 
that parallel andre saying 
absolutely gut feeling is right 
thats probably way 
always will work 
in fact thats you program 
way attitude couples it, 
thought, is this part, 
could environmental effects 
like drag, srp, gravity gradient 
also we could external torques 
thats control solution, right 
thats whats producing things 
thats attitude 
couples in well
