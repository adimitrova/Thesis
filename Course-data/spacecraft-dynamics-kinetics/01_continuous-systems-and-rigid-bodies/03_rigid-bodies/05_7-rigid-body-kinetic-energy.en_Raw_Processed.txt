kinetic energy, lets start here 
we this blobs in space 
blobs in space we able to 
show kinetic energy nothing 
kinetic energy center 
mass plus kinetic energy 
center mass 
this second term contains 
deformational energy, 
if panels flexing 
fuel is sloshing 
rotational part, right 
lets use assumption 
r dot a rigid body, 
doesnt go to zero, 
r dot became omega crossed r, 
body relative derivative zero 
so also going to 
focus rotational side 
this is basically translational 
energy comes 
orbits class 
going to focus orbits in 
here, rotational dynamics, so 
going to cover that 
this is i plugged 
in r dot is omega cross r 
so you get a bunch cross products, 
dot product 
you know right away there 
must magic trick identity 
that we rearrange this 
thats kind im here, 
almost actually 
first, im using trig here, this omega 
is a constant seen integration 
if rigid, every point 
to rotating rate 
so this omega i take outside 
theres a dot product 
okay i use a vector identity 
already to rewrite this this form, 
i could take omega 
outside to dot product 
here im still left 
omega in middle 
we trick that 
a cross b is minus b cross a 
that puts right hand side 
you take that one well 
in fact if you go back look hc, 
this whole definition is nothing hc 
in fact this term becomes nothing 
inertia tense times omega 
inertia tense times 
omega nothing 
angular momentum that point c 
so nice, we have, rotational 
energy simply written one half 
omega dotted angular momentum 
two vectors dotted together 
you dot them, 
mathematically make sure theyre 
taken respect to frame 
here is written in 
a frame agnostic way 
so angle rotation, so 
thats thing, h is i omega, 
you might remember rotational energy 
inertia times angular 
rate squared fixed axis rotation 
this is d version that 
you would onehalf 
omega transpose i omega 
thats basically inertia omega squared 
, essentially thats is 
power 
we earlier, 
if time derivative a blob, 
first part translation force 
times inertial velocity, again, 
thats translational sign 
we care here is dot 
so if you differentiate this term, 
you will end this 
to get this form, you need to 
rotational equations motion, 
we havent derived yet 
i will let you, this is something 
you make a note in exam, 
definitely go back make sure you 
go here to here, simplifies 
beauty this is, 
translation, 
we force started 
translational velocity 
rotation, you torque 
dotted angular velocity 
really type 
term that going to 
thats makes, 
this is gives you power rate 
to system 
is tdot going to zero 
lets ignore translation, 
well focus this 
is power equation 
going to zero 
sheila, you think 
without reading more, 
i want to hear you think 
angular velocity is zero 
you could, if youre spinning 
center mass is acceleration is zero, 
rc 
well going in 
translation right 
okay 
focus this one, 
rotational side 
makes this second term go to zero 
omega could zero, yes 
kind a trivial 
dynamical system then, yes, 
if energy is zero 
energy rate is going to zero 
that works, yep 
else could you 
inaudible make lc zero 
so is lc here 
inaudible 

is lc here 
torque 
a torque 
so this is a torque point c 
in fact we get this torque, 
this torque is due to external forces 
we derived this stuff 
so this dynamical system, 
if external torque that 
rigid body is zero, 
you wont dissipate energy 
this makes a great integration check 
so you guys writing numerical code, 
youve got something thats spinning 
theres external torque this system 
i know energy to preserved 
if we h dot equal to l, 
that thing 
angle momentum seen 
inertial observer, 
thats that dot meant right, 
inertial derivative 
seen inertial observer, 
h to a constant vector if 
external torque is acting 
things become fantastic 
integration checks 
this is a single rigid body 
even if you multibody, 
complex panels flapping, reaction wheels, 
gyros spinning, twisting, this stuff 
still to hold, is really nice 
if there is a torque 
acting that system 
i actually predict quickly 
kinetic energy needs to change 
this becomes a nice integration check, 
i compute kinetic energy 
simulation numerically 
differentiate to get dot 
compare, 
i know i applied this gravity gradient 
torque, this is spin rate time 
energy changed this 
many joules per second, right 
so tools becomes very, 
useful validation tools, also 
analysis you will see 
so torquefree motion is 
momentum is inertially preserved 
kinetic energy is preserved, 
this is zero 
third option actually could exist, 
in that dot product goes to zero 
maybe you particular torques 
applied, that matter 
spin rate is, right 
torques orthogonal to that 
in that case you 
a nonworking force acting 
thats call 
doesnt, 
work means doesnt 
change energy state 
so theres three ways, 
either omega zero, lc zero, 
two things orthogonal 
dot goes to zero 
over, if you to work 
between points time, you this 
a time integral you could 
also in spatial integral
