if you pick vector components, this is 
written in a corner frame, 
independent way 
im taking cross product operator 
representing in a matrix form 
to actually numerically compute it, 
youd to take r, r, r 
first rule becomes minus 
r plus r, right, you break 
that means youve picked 
a particular body frame 
so if you that that matrix 
minus sign, gives you this definition 
if you replace r, r, r x, 
y, z this look familiar 
you would y squared 
plus z squared, x squared plus z squared, 
x squared plus y squared 
different 
moments inertia definitions 
we diagonal 
terms that appear well 
so generally, to a rigid body 
inertia tensor, is im showing 
here, will a three three matrix 
you numerically evaluate 
to so, theres two conditions 
one, weve picked 
point taking moments 
rs defined relative 
to center mass 
you numerically evaluate it, 
you pick a particular coordinate frame 
say, okay, one access point is forward 
second one is to left 
third one is 
if you pick a different coordinate frame, 
you would different components 
you get a different inertia matrix 
representation inertia tensor 
inertia tensor is really an invariant, 
thats 
this space craft one inertia tensor 
we numerically express 
theres an infinity answers, 
i could pick a infinity body frames 
to break vectors 
tildes compute this 
this body integral is fun 
gets tedious 
cat programs love this 
know every nut 
bolt panel fuel tank is, 
everything that goes spacecraft 
so simply to sum up, know 
location, this math, times dn 
sum everything up, 
spits in a heartbeat 
analytically 
a little bit tedious, so 
we will look tricks that we dont 
to redo this integral every time 
if i taking moments this 
point, i putting this end 
a robot arm 
i need movement this point 
i to redo this math 
so angular momentum expression, 
we said, hc 
you already identified that term 
nothing inertia tensor 
i writing ic times omega 
there is 
notational subtlety here 
here i picked a particular bonding frame 
here i specifying body 
so im really equating matrix math is 
equivalent to this tensor vector math 
inertia tensor, think 
a twodimensional vector, right 
i write quantities in a general 
way, i evaluate vector i 
to a coordinate frame to 
break components add 
subtract 
you write in 
a coordinate agnostic way 
thats im here 
im saying, if this is b frame, 
this better in b frame 
otherwise, youre adding apples 
oranges 
but, this also in q 
frame r frame, doesnt matter 
in vectorial way, we 
write tensor operator like this 
so thats inertia tensor
