1
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:07,280
So now there's two aspects.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,420
Either we need to have a different point
about which we're taking moments or

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,520
we're taking a different corner frame.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,600
And hopefully you've
seen some of this before.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,330
Just going to go through
this pretty quickly.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,440
The book derives this,
if you want to look at this steps, but

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm just going to give you the answer.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,950
So if you have the inertia tensor
about the center of mass and

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,160
that's typically what a statics
mechanics book gives you.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,059
And now you have this block, or
this cone, or this panel, right.

11
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,428
And then it gives you X, Y, and
Z coordinates, and assumes that things

12
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:42,670
are lined up with symmetry, it gives you
this answer, basically, in that form.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,860
For some reason this panel,
you don't need the inertia, the moments.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,120
About its center of mass, but
it's going to be attached to a spacecraft.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,950
The arm is the panel.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,590
The panel center of mass is here, but

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,320
the spacecraft center of mass
might be somewhere else.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,510
How do I get these moments about here?

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,800
You could redo all these integrals.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,698
Or this parallel axis theorem basically
allows you to take moments about other

21
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:07,298
points.

22
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:10,581
And the way this is written is you need
the inertia tenser about the center of

23
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,658
mass, that's always going to be
the smallest inertia you'll have,

24
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,670
any further away and
it's going to get bigger.

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,750
And you get mass times distance squared,
that's probably how you remember

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,950
parallaxes theorem for
fixed axis rotation.

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,600
If this is the inertia about center and

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,540
all of a sudden I'm spinning
about the end-point.

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,910
You would have that distance squared times
mass that you have to add to the inertia.

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,010
This is a 3D version of that.

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,600
Total mass,
I need to know what is that shift.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
So I'm taking moments about O.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,940
There's a vector going from
O to the center of mass.

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,830
And I'm calling that one RC again.

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,170
And I've got a tilde form
to avoid a minus sign so

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,600
it's plus mass times distance squared
essentially but in a tilde formulation.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,640
So that's how we can,
we don't have to reevaluate

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,070
the inertia tenser every time we
have a different moment point.

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,250
You just use this theorem.

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,820
Here's the one subtlety
people often trip over.

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,140
In here again, we mention these tensers
when you numerically value a three pathway

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,210
matrices.

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,990
You have to pick a coordinate frame.

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,940
Make sure you're adding these things
up in the same coordinate frame.

45
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,510
That includes this.

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,450
So these RC tildes better
be broken down in the same

47
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,440
N frame if this is given in the N frame.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Or if this is given in the B frame,
you have to write RC in the B frame.

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,220
RC's often given in the other frame.

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,980
You have a, your cube set,
it goes on to the space station.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,850
You probably have your cube set inertia
about at the center of mass but

52
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,260
then it's in the space, and
that's in the cube set frame.

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,170
But where, it is in the space station its
typically expressed to you in a space

54
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,190
station coordinate frame.

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,130
All right, relative to the space station
you put that cube set at this launch

56
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,410
location.

57
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,690
Well, then you have to of course
use a DCM to map vectors from

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,970
a space station frame to body
frame before you apply this stuff.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,100
That's the one step I often see missed.

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,690
Right, so just make sure if you do this
math everything's taken with respect to

61
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,452
the same frame.
