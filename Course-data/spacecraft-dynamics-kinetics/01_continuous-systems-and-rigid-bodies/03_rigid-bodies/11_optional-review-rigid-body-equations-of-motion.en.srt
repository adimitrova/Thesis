1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,710
Last time, we derived the equations
of motion of a rigid body.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,490
I got little cube with me here,
it's somewhat rigid right now.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,160
How do we find the equations of
motion of a rigid body, Spencer?

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,180
Before you read too much.

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,980
>> You use super particle theorem on this
center of mass because it's rigid, so

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,080
the center of mass shouldn't
be changing position.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,790
>> True,
if you worry about the translational part.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,450
At this stage of the class, really
as we're talking about rigid bodies,

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,550
we're going to start just dropping
the translational, for most of it.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,300
If not I will make it very explicit.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,960
So if I'm talking about
the equations of motion,

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,490
I'm really just talking about
the rotational side of it.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,290
So how do we find the rotational
side of the equation?

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,310
What are we actually looking for?

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,820
What's the variable?

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,450
Yeah, we're actually looking for
omega dot, right?

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,090
That's the,
omega is already a rate information so

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,010
omega dot is the acceleration.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,950
That's your angular acceleration.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,679
Once we have it we can integrate it.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So whereas translation have f equals ma,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,280
you go straight from forces to
acceleration of your position description,

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,670
in attitude we have this kinetics and
kinematics always broken up.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,080
We have somehow added to coordinate rates
related to omega, and then an omega dot

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,880
relates to forces and torques and
everything acting on it, right.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,320
So you have this clear
split that you have to do.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
So here we're looking for
the second part, the kinetics.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,580
What's the fundamental property,
Robert, that we use to drive this?

29
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,440
>> [COUGH]
>> [INAUDIBLE]

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,937
>> Which principle did we apply?

31
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:42,480
>> Conservation of angular momentum.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,413
>> Why is it conserved?

33
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:55,392
Why is the rotational
motion of a rigid body,

34
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:59,119
why does it have a conserved
angular momentum?

35
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:06,255
>> because-
>> Ansel, can you help him?

36
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:07,879
>> It's torque-free?

37
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,000
>> If it's torque-free, but
I didn't mention torque-free motion.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,740
So let's assume it has torque,
what do we need then?

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,797
How do we get to an omega dot?

40
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:25,913
Mariel, which principles do we
use to get equations of motion?

41
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:33,824
>> Like H equals the derivative of H time,

42
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:38,630
or plus, omega cross.

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,813
>> Okay, you've taken
the derivative of it already, but

44
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:43,610
what is the inertial derivative of
the angular momentum of the system?

45
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,130
>> The right hand side of-
>> Yeah, L.

46
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,585
>> L, there we go, right.

47
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,310
So like f equals ma, this is good for

48
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,200
a continuum if we have center of mass, or,
and here implied if I don't write a sub c,

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,724
it's always implied to be center
of mass in this notation, right?

50
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:06,950
So we can use H=L, the key features is,
this dot has to be an inertial derivative,

51
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,770
like f equals ma, those a's have
to be the inertial acceleration.

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,740
And this L is the net sum of all
the external ports acting on the system,

53
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,620
which right now we're just writing as L.

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,820
Later on, that could be gravity gradient
torques, it could be drag torques,

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,410
it could be control torques with
thrusters, or something like that.

56
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,120
Many ways to break it up, good.

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,947
So let's review quickly, this is going to
be a good, what is H of a rigid body?

58
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:35,742
All right, once we said this thing wasn't
blob and jello and flexing, it's solid,

59
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,620
what did H become?

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,390
Was it, Brett?

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,700
>> Not sure.

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,500
>> What is angular momentum?

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Go back to your sophomore level class,
fixed axis rotation.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,592
What is angular momentum?

65
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,600
>> Is it the inertia times-
>> Yes, inertia times what?

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
>> The regular rate?

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,398
>> Yes, and
this is the 3D version of that.

68
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,940
i omega, right?

69
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,700
Review this stuff, otherwise, hour and

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,170
15 minutes you're not going to have
time to remember such things, okay?

71
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,560
We're getting up to that exam point.

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,660
So if H is this, this is the inertia
tensor, right, we talked about that.

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,534
This is written as is in a coordinate
frame independent way, you just have to

74
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:27,362
make sure if this is in the B frame,
this needs to be also in the same B frame.

75
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:30,317
And this gives you the answer in
a rotating frame and the B frame but

76
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,530
you could pick any frame you wish.

77
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,152
Good, now we need to do H dot.

78
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:37,010
So Mariel actually already
got us on this track.

79
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,026
We need an inertial derivative and

80
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:46,431
we choose to take a body
frame derivative of H.

81
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:48,560
I won't go all the details,
we did that last time.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
This is just a review.

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,320
Why do we choose to do
a body frame derivative?

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,186
Kevin?

85
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,812
Why is that going to make our life
easier dealing with this term?

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Let's break it up,
you're going to have chain rule.

87
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,373
You're going to have
the body frame derivative

88
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:20,507
of this tensor times
omega plus the inertial

89
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:25,650
tensor times [COUGH]
the anglular velocity.

90
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:33,690
And that's not H dot,
let me just, scratch that.

91
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,400
We're just doing, we're choosing to
do the body frame derivative of H.

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,860
So Kevin, why do the body frame
derivative of I omega easier?

93
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,570
>> Because then the derivative of
the inertia matrix is going to be zero.

94
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,840
>> Exactly, and see by the body,
every point to here, if you just lock your

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,660
arms out and you start rotating, as you're
rotating that arm is always to your left.

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,020
The mass distribution,
all those moments you computed,

97
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,850
and you got the inertia tenser,
they're fixed, as seen by the body.

98
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,090
As seen by you guys as I tumble an object,
the mass distribution is clearly changing.

99
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,330
So if you did the inertial
derivative directly on this,

100
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,870
you'd have lots of extra terms.

101
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,150
You'd have to map it to
the inertial frame, DCN, DCN dots,

102
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,970
DCN dots r minus omega til DCs.

103
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,680
And it all looks much more complicated,
but it's the same simple answer.

104
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,120
This ends up being,
as seen by the body observer, it's 0.

105
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,071
So that's why we do this,
what happens to this derivative?

106
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:37,810
Anybody remember?

107
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,010
What happens to that, yes?

108
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,540
>> It's just omega dot,
because it's the same inertial frame.

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
>> Because this is really,
if I write omega, it's short for

110
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,678
omega B relative to N.

111
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,340
We're typically dealing with B and N for

112
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,160
the next several weeks so
this becomes much easier.

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,562
The B and the N frame derivative are the
same, the cross product always drops out.

114
00:06:56,562 --> 00:07:03,124
Good, so if you do all this stuff,
then H dot as Mariel was pointing out,

115
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:10,009
really ends up giving you I omega dot plus
I have to do the transport theorem so

116
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,841
I have an omega crossed H and
H is I omega, and that's equal to L.

117
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,855
There we go.

118
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,708
Is this only true for
particular coordinate frames,

119
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,808
or is this true for any frame?

120
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:29,198
Daniel, what do you think?

121
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,976
>> An inertial frame?

122
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,490
That's two frames.

123
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,790
>> Yeah, this is really written in
a very frame agnostic way again.

124
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,675
We haven't picked anything, we just solved
it, like we did earlier with positions and

125
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:49,580
angular velocities.

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,080
They're just vectors, we can start adding,

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
subtracting them without ever
specifying where does EL really point.

128
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,660
Once you want to get a numerical answer,

129
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,010
well you have to resolve the geometry and
have all the right stuff.

130
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,870
And so this is kind of the same way,
this is a very, like a vector.

131
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,530
We have vectors and tensors but
they're written in a frame agnostic way.

132
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,830
And when you do the math, just make
sure everything's in the same frame.

133
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,055
Especially when we get to the control
side, we'll be doing this a lot.

134
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,185
This is how we'll be
deriving our controls, but

135
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:18,565
when you code it,
you have to go, wait a minute.

136
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,105
This will make a R, that's coming in,

137
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:22,535
that's in the R frame and
this stuff is in the B frame.

138
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,625
Well then implied, you're going to
have to do some translations.

139
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,175
Matt?

140
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,695
>> I was writing when you wrote it,
[COUGH] and

141
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,015
I don't remember from last time.

142
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:33,515
Where does the second term in
that L equation come from?

143
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,065
>> This one?

144
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:34,565
>> Yeah.

145
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,430
>> I need H dot equal to L.

146
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,110
And basically what we do is, we take
the body frame derivative of H, but

147
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,560
I need the inertial derivative, so
you need omega crossed H as well.

148
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,350
And omega cross, H is I omega,

149
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,550
and omega cross H is the same
thing as omega tilde I omega.

150
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,760
That's the form we typically see it.

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,750
>> Cool, thank you.

152
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,400
>> And then that's L.

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,510
So you can see, in exam this is something
that shouldn't take you more than three

154
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,460
minutes if you know what you're doing.

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,750
But there's lots of subtleties,
if you just jump to the answer,

156
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,630
the answer's in the equation
sheet you guys have.

157
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,300
Just giving me the answer will
give you zero points in the exam.

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,360
It's all about the path and the details.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,290
So make sure every time we go
through this, hopefully more and

160
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,170
more will sink in.

161
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,340
Make sure you get this stuff.

162
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,170
So, good, now we have very specific frames
that make your inertia tensor diagonal.

163
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,450
Trevor, what do we call such frames?

164
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,380
>> Principle frames.

165
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,894
>> Was principle coordinate frames,

166
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,278
are there an infinity of
principle coordinate frames?

167
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,045
You say no.

168
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:35,665
And you slow down?

169
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:38,413
[LAUGH]
>> Well, for a particular application, for

170
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,819
a particular rigid body,
it'll be the same.

171
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,241
>> So, here's a nice rigid body,

172
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:51,661
are there infinity of
principal coordinate frames?

173
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,924
>> Mandara, you think so?

174
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,301
Why?

175
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:01,741
>> because we have one axis
as they symmetry axis,

176
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:06,056
we can have the other two in
the plane orthogonal too.

177
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,653
>> Okay but if it's a cube.

178
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:12,335
>> Then all of them are-
>> See, all of a sudden,

179
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:12,871
ooh, wait a minute.

180
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,122
>> [LAUGH]
>> If it's a cube what happens to

181
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,240
my principle inertias?

182
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,510
>> They're all the same?

183
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,320
>> Yeah, they're repeated.

184
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,395
Hm, right, all these easy
questions at 8:00 in the morning.

185
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:26,060
>> [LAUGH]
>> I need more coffee.

186
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,036
Okay, so if they're all the same, why does
it make you hesitate all of the sudden?

187
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,415
>> because the vectors, the uniqueness.

188
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,070
>> Yeah, then you have to kind of,

189
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,010
the eigenvectors form different
ways that you can map to there.

190
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,650
You have to take a closer look at it.

191
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,740
If it's a body,
let's go to a simpler body.

192
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,850
This one has three distinct inertias.

193
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,200
It's definitely rigid, right?

194
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,550
Are you going to have more than
one principle coordinate frame?

195
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,819
Bryan, you don't think so?

196
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:05,640
>> I think you probably, yeah,
I think you probably could.

197
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,970
It depends on the symmetry of the object.

198
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,110
>> This is it, I'm showing you the object,
there's no more depends, it is.

199
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,544
>> Right, but if you take the moment
of inertia around one of those

200
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:25,673
principal axis, negative moment
of inertia on the other one.

201
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:29,176
>> Right, for every body,
it doesn't actually depend on the shape,

202
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:32,818
every body has at least some principal
axis that will diagonalize it.

203
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,550
And maybe an infinity, if it's a cylinder,
that's kind of what you guys are thinking

204
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,150
of, if it's a cylinder, there's definitely
an infinity of ways that you have it.

205
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,370
But if you have even three discrete
ones like this, or it's something very

206
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,450
amorphous it will still have three
principal inertias, principal axis.

207
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,370
But when you pick those eigenvectors,
you remember wait a minute,

208
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,396
I can have a positive direction but
who says this isn't your principle axis?

209
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,680
Maybe you want a frame the points towards
the tail because that's where your docking

210
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,730
porter is or you want to port towards,
find the points towards the nose

211
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,030
because this is a flight frame and you
kind of worry about where you're flying.

212
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,600
There's immediately, well there's two
options and then there's another one and

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,920
so there's a kind of
permutation you can go through,

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,400
there's an infinity of principle
frames that a general body would have.

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,250
But there's definitely a finite set
because you can always rearrange what's

216
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,490
your first, what's your second,
what's your third.

217
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,680
And plus or minus,
just always keep it right-handed, right?

218
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,630
So yeah,
there are several that we can pick and

219
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,860
so if we look at that,
we went through that actually.

220
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,050
If this is diagonal, these simplify down
to those three scalar equations we saw,

221
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,670
and then we can do that.

222
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,210
Now, the last question we had
we covered was integration.

223
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,260
If you want to integrate the complete
motion we have something and

224
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,080
we give it a spin and it tumbles.

225
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,215
How do we now numerically solve this?

226
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:59,802
Tosh, help us out,
how do we now write an integrator for

227
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:03,230
a complete 3D attitude dynamics?

228
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:10,666
>> So you'd look at your omega dot and
[INAUDIBLE].

229
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,390
>> But besides omega dot,
what else do you need?

230
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,034
What describes the full
attitude state of a rigid body?

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,497
>> I guess, [INAUDIBLE] general forces.

232
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:29,597
>> Nope, I'm asking for
what describes, what coordinates

233
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:35,023
do you need to fully describe
the orientation of a rigid body?

234
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:41,600
>> There's no other answer but
MRPs, I would say.

235
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,835
>> Not MRPs,
it was a good answer, definitely.

236
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:46,008
>> [LAUGH]
>> Thanks for sucking up, I appreciate it.

237
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:50,020
>> [LAUGH]
>> So you need an attitude measure, right?

238
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,690
Just like if you have f equals ma,

239
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,450
spring mass to amperes system,
think back to that form.

240
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,350
Okay, we've got x double dots,
that's nice.

241
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,720
But I have, every integrator writes
these things back into first order form.

242
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,038
So you define that x1 is equal to x,
and x2 is equal to x dot.

243
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,820
And then x1 dot is equal, and
you just do that classic stuff.

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,730
We have to do the same thing for attitude,
it's just we have different equations.

245
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,610
So we still need the attitude measure,

246
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,880
that was the integrator you wrote
earlier in these classes, right?

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,730
So you had something for
MRPs or quaternion or

248
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,460
whatever you wish to,
some attitude measure.

249
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,855
So that means you have a state
vector that is going to be now a,

250
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:34,290
if it's an MRP it's six by one.

251
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,275
If it's a quaternion it's a seven by one,
right,

252
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,788
this is what we have to propagate forward.

253
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:45,170
Otherwise this is very much what you did
before, you have your current states.

254
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,670
Then you compute k1 is
equal to the derivative.

255
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,700
So if x dot is equal to an f function,
depending on these, all right.

256
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,906
Then the first order one would just give
me what's the derivative of these states.

257
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:09,144
And then xn + 1 is xn

258
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:14,700
+ k1 times delta t.

259
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,047
Or you can do a fourth
order on the cut out or

260
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,413
whatever you wish to integrate, right?

261
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:22,582
It's the same integration that
you're doing in those problems,

262
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:26,810
you're just expanding now, now we have
to keep track of attitude and rates.

263
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,490
Now there was some discussion that
we had regarding, could we integrate

264
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,050
attitude separately from our kinetics
equation, from our omega dot equation?

265
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,440
So, Nick, do you remember the arguments?

266
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,330
How does attitude actually couple
into this differential equation?

267
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:54,211
>> [COUGH] I guess you could
single out the omega dot term.

268
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:56,690
>> No, omega is the state.

269
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:03,524
It's not,
>> I guess I don't

270
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:04,779
understand the question.

271
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,668
>> How does attitude
couple into this equation?

272
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:12,538
Does this differential equation
depend on my instantaneous attitude?

273
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,680
>> No, well, I was confident.

274
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,600
>> It was very confident,
I give you kudos for that.

275
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,590
It was completely wrong, but
it was very confident, absolutely.

276
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,940
Why does attitude couple into this,
where, right?

277
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,330
because omega that's just another state,
that's not the coupling itself.

278
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,730
It's a derivative of some stuff.

279
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,962
The interia tensor, well,
that doesn't really,

280
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:34,510
I don't have different mass
because I point differently.

281
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,080
It's a rigid body,
it doesn't matter on the orientation.

282
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,760
The only thing left is L,
How does attitude couple into L?

283
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,420
What are some physical
examples of torques?

284
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,905
Daniel?
>> Some torques are added to it

285
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:48,850
independently.

286
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,044
>> Yes.
>> Drag, SRP.

287
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:53,266
>> Drag, SRP, gravity, gradience,
or even our feedback control,

288
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,070
you will see very much,
that's where it couples.

289
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,730
So while there's instances where you
could just solve for omega first and

290
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,930
then solve for
the attitude as you did kind of.

291
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,132
I just gave you the omegas essentially
in earlier homeworks, right?

292
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:08,240
When you code it,
I highly encourage just to avoid that,

293
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,230
just give the general answer,
it's simple enough to do.

294
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,700
And you want to solve your attitude and
your omegas all simultaneously.

295
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,350
Later on in class we can even add
other stuff like reaction wheels or,

296
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,300
that quickly moves to 6010,
the follow on class.

297
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,930
Matt?
>> [COUGH] Excuse me,

298
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,270
I have a question about that
equation on the last page.

299
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,141
So when you were just asking that
question I was thinking that

300
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:36,794
you were pointing towards the I's because
this is an inertial derivative and

301
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,885
the inertial frame I will change.

302
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:42,620
But are these is constant because
we derived it in the body frame?

303
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,789
>> These are just tensors.

304
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,330
I mean if you say constant I have to
ask constant as seen by what frame?

305
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,720
The inertia is not a matrix like a DCM,

306
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,660
where it's just a three by three grouping
of cosines that we picked, right?

307
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,850
We could have picked something else.

308
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,600
This is really fundamentally a tensor.

309
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,880
Which means just like a vector it,

310
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,649
when you numerically evaluate it you
have to pick a coordinate frame.

311
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,675
So I just said look this been a completely
vectorial thing I can take the body frames

312
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:16,265
derivative of this and
what happens then is,

313
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:20,155
well the body frame derivative of H,
and H is I omega.

314
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:22,965
You break it up into two parts, right?

315
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:26,815
Here, I can immediately say this part is
going to go to zero, which simplifies it.

316
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,725
And this derivative body frame is the same
thing as the inertial derivative,

317
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,135
as we discussed.

318
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:36,735
So this H B frame derivative becomes
nothing but I omega dot, that's this part.

319
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,366
Could then, to get the inertial
derivative, I have to add omega cross H,

320
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,660
which is equivalent to here.

321
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,410
So this gives me the answer but

322
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,020
I've never actually picked
a particular courting frame.

323
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,110
Remember when we're using
transport theorem and

324
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,340
we say we're taking the derivative
of vector as seen by this frame.

325
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,830
It doesn't mean you have to
write that vector in that frame.

326
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,240
Often we have,
that's why we've chosen that frame.

327
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,910
Here, we haven't chosen the B frame
derivative because we have a particular

328
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,974
coordinate frame, we've chosen a B frame
derivative because as seen by the B frame,

329
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:13,995
the mass distribution for a rigid body is
constant and that derivative goes to zero.

330
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,830
>> I think this was my confusion,
no matter was I is, it's constant.

331
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,150
>> It's constant, exactly.

332
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,450
For any shape with asymmetries and

333
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,200
whatever's going on,
this is always true, right?

334
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,010
The only thing is, it's rigid.

335
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,400
That's the single rigid body and
now we have this in a very general way.

336
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,130
You can see this looks suspiciously simple
in undergraduate stuff we go through this

337
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,298
very, very quickly.

338
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:39,454
But then all this, there's all these
layers of details that are on top of

339
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:42,482
this that take a little bit more
time to sink in, so, work with this.
