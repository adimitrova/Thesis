1
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,060
Enough of blobs, let's get rigid.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,370
All right, so now we're going to deal with
everything on, things are going to freeze.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,311
Instead of just general continuum, but
I think this is a good classic thing.

4
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,460
Earlier stuff, definitely things
that I will put on the exam.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,830
Something like that's going to
be on there guaranteed.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,979
But now we're going to freeze it.

7
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:25,857
How do we do that?

8
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:28,190
How does that change my definitions?

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,000
How does it change momentum, energy,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,320
all this kind of stuff and
we want to look at this.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,370
So now angular momentum about a point O,
this is an inertial origin.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,340
I've picked that already.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,690
I can write that as my position vector or
cross or with dots.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,810
That goes to each DM.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,120
I didn't draw the the DMs here anymore.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,840
But this is now a rigid boby.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,280
So if it's rigid, every point in
the body has the same angular velocity.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,420
If I'm spinning, then the speed of
my right hand is different than

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,545
the speed of my left hand,
the velocity, right?

20
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,780
because one's moving forward, that's
a different vector than a velocity vector

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,750
moving backwards relative to me,
opposite for you guys, all right.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,710
But the angular velocity,
if we're spinning,

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,459
everybody needs to be rotating
at one degree per second.

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,430
Otherwise if the panel number two is
rotating at two degrees per second,

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,210
panel number one is only rotating
at one degree per second,

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,150
those panels are going to
catch up at some point, right?

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,030
It's deforming, that's not a rigid body.

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,400
So as before when we argued, RC was common
with the body integrals here we would have

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,330
tricks where we can say omega is constant
on a rigid body or blog the jello.

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,250
That's not true because everybody could
be spinning in different ways right

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,070
in that case.

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,440
So that's one thing.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,220
Another one, this is the basic definition.

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
You've seen now how we break this up.

35
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,160
We write r as big R as Rc plus little r.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,380
And then same thing here, with thoughts,
do the cross products on your own.

37
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,190
Make sure you can derive this.

38
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,950
And then you come there.

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,570
There will be terms that vanish, but again
the angular momentum about point O can be

40
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,350
written as, this is the angular
momentum of the center of mass

41
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,210
plus the angular momentum
about the center of mass.

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,570
Kind of what we did with energy as well.

43
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,700
So I'm leaving this up to you
to practice and go through and

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,830
make sure you can go from here to here.

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,300
Now this part, that's your Orbits class.

46
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,260
You've all taken some type
of Orbits class probably.

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,280
And you hang momentum on orbit and
how it's conserved and

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,410
from that you get all of the different
chronic intersections and trajectories.

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,780
And that comes from here.

50
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,389
That's cool, but
we don't care about that part.

51
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,010
This class is all about
attitude of spacecraft, right?

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,000
The translational side, as you see through
the super particle theorem, you can really

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,140
handle separately and track what happens
to the center of mass of a spacecraft.

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,700
I care about what happens about
the center of mass in this class.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,230
So I have wheels, I have gyroscopics,
all the stuff, that's what I care about.

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,260
That's what the attitude dynamics is.

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,230
So instead of HO, I'm just going to keep
this part which I'm going to write as HC.

58
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,900
That's the angular momentum
about the center of mass and

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,270
that will simply be r cross r dots dm.

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,440
Same definitions we had before right?

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,730
So that's good.

62
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,669
So now if this is rigid.

63
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,220
People, if this is rigid,
what happens to this derivative?

64
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:43,743
>> r dot, it goes to zero doesn't it?

65
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:44,910
>> Okay, who agrees with that?

66
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,342
Who disagrees with that?

67
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:53,756
And the rest of you are asleep,
okay, or just confused, that's fair.

68
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,170
I'm also confused sometimes.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,156
So, you agree that it would go to zero?

70
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,179
Sorry, what was your name again?

71
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:01,724
>> Ansel.

72
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,030
>> Ansel, thank you.

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,784
Why do you think it would go to zero?

74
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,574
>> I thought that's how
a rigid body was defined,

75
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:09,140
that the points don't move
relative to the center of mass.

76
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,982
>> What does this dot mean?

77
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:14,570
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> So this is your body.

78
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,800
And to track this point, this little
knob at the end of the pen, right?

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,702
It's inertial, I mean it's an inertially
fixed spin axis, it's a rigid body.

80
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:34,409
Is the velocity as seen by you,
an inertial observer, zero?

81
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:38,370
Right, the position vector would be center
of mass to this little knob, right?

82
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,630
And that vector is clearly
rotating as seen by you guys.

83
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,975
So as seen by what frame would this time
derivative go to zero if it is rigid?

84
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:51,753
>> Body frame.

85
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:52,753
>> The body frame.

86
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,000
That's the key.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,970
So I'm glad you guys mentioned inertia
because this an easy stumbling block.

88
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,470
Everybody starts out with, it's rigid.

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,690
All the dots go to zero.

90
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,100
No.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,150
This is the inertial
derivative of the velocity.

92
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,830
If it's rigid,

93
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,790
it just means as I'm rotating,
my right hand is always to my right.

94
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,880
It's not moving up, down,
otherwise I'm not being a rigid body.

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,150
So only as seen by the body are these
time derivatives zero for a rigid body.

96
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,670
That's the key thing that
everybody always misses otherwise.

97
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,640
So good, so now if we do that, we know
how to do this transport theorem, right?

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,780
Kinematics comes back and
we take the body frame derivative, why?

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,400
Because we know it's going to go to zero,
we love zero.

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,220
And what you're left
with is omega cross r.

101
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,560
Okay, good.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,310
We do that so r dot is nothing but omega
crossed r and I can plug that in here.

103
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,590
So I get an r cross omega cross r.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,410
This form is not very convenient.

105
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,580
I said omega is constant
as seen by the body itself.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,440
If it's rigid, every point in that body
needs to be tumbling at the same rate or

107
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,975
it's deforming.

108
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:59,860
But in a cross product like this, I can't
just pull the middle term out, all right.

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,140
So I want to make it either at the left
hand side, or the right hand side.

110
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,640
Then I can take it outside of the body
integral, and that's what I'm doing here.

111
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,850
On A cross B is a same
thing as minus B cross A.

112
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,840
So I flipped it, and then I have r cross
r cross omega with the minus sign.

113
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,830
And in matrix form, this r cross r
cross is nothing but r tilde r tilde.

114
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,300
Again, that's where
the minus sign comes from.

115
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,682
And then now I can take the omega

116
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:33,440
outside of that interval because it is
rigid, right, that is the key assumption.

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,625
Anybody recognize what this
term is going to become?

118
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,657
Angular momentum turns to
be something times rates.

119
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:42,469
>> Inertia.

120
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,600
>> Inertia, yeah,
moment of inertia, exactly.

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,253
So these can become our inertia tensor
that you've seen from your statics and

122
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,273
mechanics classes.

123
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,875
So we're just going to derive this now.
