1
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:08,760
Where we have a slender rod
that's falling to the ground.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,100
So basically, think of this rod.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,400
You sign in this up on
a frictionless surface.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
Think of an ice rink, a very slick ice
rink and he's standing it up and for

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,330
some reason this is perturbed.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,300
There's no friction force here
holding your lower end in place.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,975
So once you slide off you're
just going to slide out.

8
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:30,425
So it's basically just going to
fall down and slide down like this.

9
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:31,795
That's what's going to happen.

10
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,345
And what we're going to try to find
here are our equations of motion.

11
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:39,585
And we're going to use these very
principles, super particle theorem,

12
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:40,442
HL equal to L.

13
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:45,420
The inertia tenser definitions and so
forth to derive all the right quantities.

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,330
So I'm giving you here from a material
statics book you can find easily

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:00,200
if you have a slender rod then the inertia
about it's center of mass is mass over 12.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,910
L squared, L's length of the rod.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,200
So slender means we're
ignoring the other dimensions.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,840
It's just a homogeneous, very,
very thin mass distribution, right.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,160
So that's what you get there.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,270
So we're going, okay, so we have that.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,743
Now let's look at the angular momentum.

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,594
If we want to write Hc, the angle
momentum above the center of mass,

23
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:27,270
we needed the inertia tensor times
the angular velocity of this stuff.

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,710
And you can see,
I've got a body fixed point,

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,410
a body fixed frame, E,
that I'm defining here.

26
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,415
So EL, E theta, where is E3 pointing?

27
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,143
Let me just make sure you're
looking at the picture, right.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,977
Into the board or out of the board?

29
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,270
>> Into.
>> Into the board, right?

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,222
eL, e theta, e3,
third finger points into the board,

31
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:51,390
that's where it's pointing, okay?

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,980
So the angular velocity
as we're tilting in 1d,

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,560
it's going to be theta dot about e3,
right.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,210
So that's what this part right here,
those two terms,

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,190
that's omega of e relative to n for
this body.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,270
Now I need the inertia tensor about this
one, so let's just write that one out.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,120
You've seen the matrix notations,

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,600
I want to make sure that you
get all this stuff right.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,030
So if we have this in the E frame,
it's a principle frame,

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,720
you will have I1, I2, I3.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,630
And, let's just ignore this.

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,761
E relative to N, theta dot e3.

43
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:37,168
What does theta dot e3 look
like as a 3 by 1 matrix?

44
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,868
0, 0, theta dot, right.

45
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,650
And yes, you have these other inertias.

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,770
We said, it's a slender rod so
there are some terms about that.

47
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,877
But in the end,
this matrix times this matrix is

48
00:02:54,877 --> 00:03:00,380
just going to give me 0,
0, I3 theta dot, right?

49
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,449
In different components,

50
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:09,607
which is equivalent to
that I3 theta dot E3.

51
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,780
And in this problem I3 is
the N over 12 L squared.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,350
That's the inertia about that,
the third axis that we have, in and

53
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,640
out of the board.

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,500
All right, we didn't need
the inertias about the long axis or

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,830
anything else like that.

56
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,900
That's where, so when you've,
this is something you want to practice.

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,320
Once it clicks,
you go how was this ever confusing?

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,272
But you want to be able to go from
the inertia stuff to this quick other

59
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,711
formulations especially
with the plane of rotation.

60
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,229
It should always give
you equivalent results.

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,470
So good, so that's how we get this part.

62
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,070
We have to angle momentum about C.

63
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,800
Now to get equations of motion,

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,600
one way we often do with rotational
side is we use Euler's equation,

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,480
which means H dot = L and taking moments
about center of mass, H dot = L holds.

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,730
And I need to have L
above the center of mass.

67
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,860
So let's see what do we have here?

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,420
What torch is being applied?

69
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,680
The only torch that's being
applied here is this normal force,

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,400
somethings holding that tip from
sliding beneath the I surface, right?

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,960
So the I is still pushing up.

72
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,310
It's just not pushing laterally.

73
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,040
So it's giving it lateral stability, but

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,910
it is holding that point in place,
all right?

75
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,510
Why does gravity's acting on this?

76
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,702
Why doesn't gravity cause any torques?

77
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:32,090
>> Ax on the center of mass.

78
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,907
>> Right, gravity ax on the center of
mass and therefore the moment on for

79
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,730
the gravity force.

80
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,460
That's when you apply it,
it would actually vanish.

81
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,380
Very good, okay.

82
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,040
So, we need the moment arm.

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,030
What is the point of force relative to the
center of mass then that's this vector.

84
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,680
So, this length is L, so

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,630
if going from here to here is minus
L over 2 in the eL direction, right?

86
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,790
Back to week one,
vectors are distances times direction.

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,255
The distance is eL over 2.

88
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,760
The direction is minus eL hat.

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,810
That's the moment arm
crossed with the force,

90
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,390
which is the normal force on the surface,
right?

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,690
And you now have an eL crossed in n2.

92
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,900
Well you're going to have to map one
into the other and that's what you get,

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,180
a sign term in here in terms of e3.

94
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,980
So we can write this out.

95
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,442
So good, we're looking for
equations of motion for theta, but

96
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:27,810
all of a sudden we have to
introduce an extra unknown.

97
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,580
We don't know what this
force is on the surface.

98
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,149
So we know right away H equal
to L is not going to be enough.

99
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:37,640
You can't have two
unknowns in one equation.

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,140
People try, they try really hard,
it just doesn't work.

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,540
So we'll need additional equations.

102
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,510
Let's first wrap this up,
we have H, we have L,

103
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,260
now the derivative of this H, inertial
derivative has to be equal to this L.

104
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Well e3, this is a rotating frame but
what can you say about e3?

105
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,680
Is that a rotating axis or
a fixed heading axis?

106
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,630
It's fixed, actually, right.

107
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,400
It's the other two that are rotating.

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,530
So e3 is actually N1,
it's the same thing as minus N3.

109
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,288
And N3's definitely an inertial frame so
that's why taken the intertial

110
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,640
derivative of this, I don't have
to treat e3 as a rotating axis.

111
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,510
It's actually a fixed axis.

112
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,120
So this inertia is fixed.

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,719
I'm not changing the mass
distribution of the rod.

114
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,550
The only thing that varies is theta.

115
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,060
So you very quickly get the inertia
times theta double dot.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,385
And here I've dropped e3.

117
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,570
Because in the end,
everything's along the e3 axis.

118
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,420
So it gives me my one thing.

119
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,100
So H dot equal to L.

120
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,310
I brought L over to the left hand side.

121
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,500
And that's how that comes in.

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,820
So this is one equation.

123
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm looking for always second
order differential equations for

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,920
equations of motion.

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,410
And so acceleration, that's my theta
double dot acceleration equation.

126
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,525
But it have an extra unknown.

127
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:56,425
So H dot equal to L was not enough,
what else do we have?

128
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,390
People.

129
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,300
>> Super particle theorem or energy?

130
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,130
Energy here is pretty smart
because there's no friction.

131
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,970
>> Yeah, energy doesn't typically
help quite in these equations of

132
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,410
motion typically.

133
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,330
The principles we use is either H = L,
there's different points we could use.

134
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,967
We've used for now the point c.

135
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,830
What was the other point
we could have used?

136
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,230
An inertia point that
was another approach.

137
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,040
And you can try H equal to L about center
of mass or about the inertial point and

138
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,660
they can give you different information.

139
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,830
And that might be a way
to get a second equation.

140
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,610
But what we're going to do here is
actually use Newton's equation.

141
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,030
Basically, super particle theorem, right?

142
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,650
That said, well whatever the sum
of the external forces is,

143
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,920
mass times the inertial
acceleration to center of mass,

144
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,658
has to be equal to that force, right?

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,590
So if we do that,
the center of mass location,

146
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,410
I'm just going to call this coordinate y,
you can see here.

147
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,455
So Y doubled up in two because its own
center of mass is only moving in N2

148
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,337
direction.

149
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,030
That makes it easy,
it's an inertial direction.

150
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,970
Take it twice derivative it's just
Y doubly NY doubled up in two.

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,660
That's my big M times rc
double dot that we have to

152
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,500
review the particle theorem, right.

153
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,060
Now that has to be equal to the sum of
the forces acting on the system, and

154
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,320
this system only has two forces.

155
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,970
There is a force on the surface that's
pushing back against the pen tip,

156
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,960
keeping it just in place.

157
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,330
And there's gravity acting on the slot and
that's why we're falling.

158
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,460
Otherwise, if you have slippery
surface on the space station and

159
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,090
without any other human slip.

160
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,244
So with gravity +N it's
in the N2 direction and

161
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:48,640
NG is in the -N2 direction so
this gives you your differential equation.

162
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,549
But you look at this and go, I can see
Brian already going wait a minute.

163
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,740
We get an end that's good but
now we introduce a y.

164
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,440
We just seem to be chasing our tail here.

165
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,430
Every time we have an equation
we have an extra unknown.

166
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,620
So now we have two equations and three
unknowns we're not making any progress.

167
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,680
And Brian's absolutely right,
so what are we missing?

168
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,150
We need an extra equation.

169
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,080
Are y and theta independent?

170
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:20,940
Spencer, are those two independent
coordinates of the dynamical system?

171
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,595
Or another question is, this dynamical
system has how many degrees of freedom?

172
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,329
>> One.

173
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,380
>> One, right,
there's only one degree of freedom.

174
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,080
There's only one angle, right.

175
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,350
Now with that angle, we can prescribe
what that height has to be.

176
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,910
So there must be a geometric relationship
between the y coordinate and

177
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,570
the theta coordinates, right.

178
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,640
Because you have y and theta, this didn't
turn it into a two degree freedom problem.

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,610
It's still a one degree
of freedom problem.

180
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,450
So what is the relationship?

181
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,060
And that's what we do here.

182
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,365
It's very simple, this line would be L
over 2 cosine, that gets you to heighth y.

183
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,120
That's what I have here, all right.

184
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,510
So if I have theta, I know y.

185
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,700
And now here, I need theta double dot,

186
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,382
that means you simply take 2 times
derivative of this y expression,

187
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:08,800
chain rule of this cosine, so you get
some sines and cosines and other stuff.

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,880
But that's how your y double
dots relate to your thetas.

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,730
Theta dots and theta double dots, right.

190
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,490
So those are not, we had two kinematic
variables that was convenient.

191
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,870
This y was very convenient
when writing f = ma.

192
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,500
But in the end,
we have to pick one of them and

193
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,720
write everything in terms
of one of the coordinates.

194
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,010
So if you do this, you plug this in here.

195
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,710
You can now,
actually this depends on y and

196
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,160
n, this depends on y and theta,
I can now write n in terms of theta.

197
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,470
So I get rid of one of the variables, y.

198
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,080
And now the last step is this,
this has to go back up in here and

199
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,540
now we can write our
equations of motion for

200
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,920
this slender rod falling in place,
slipping down like this.

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,350
Looks a little bit more complicated.

202
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,090
It's amazing how life gets complicated
quickly, even with simple examples.

203
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,560
Now with this differential equation,
is this a linear differential equation or

204
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,045
a non-linear differential equation?

205
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:09,070
Non-linear.

206
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,440
There's sines,
cosines of the states, right?

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,470
There's even theta dot squares, sine
squared of stuff, definitely not linear.

208
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,857
So who thinks they can quickly
solve this differential equation?

209
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,720
Darn, I always hope somebody raises their
hand because then I want to talk to you

210
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,880
about a PhD program.

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,212
because I can't solve this.

212
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,060
Maybe a mathematician can solve this.

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,650
But it's tricky, right?

214
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,870
So how do we solve this?

215
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,410
Well, we go back to integration, right?

216
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,110
You put this in state space form.

217
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,710
x1 is equal to theta.

218
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,040
x2 is equal to theta dot.

219
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,330
Then you get your sets of equations.

220
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,130
You can integrate.

221
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,530
So numerically, no problem.

222
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,000
But analytically, this can be a challenge.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,300
And very often in these problems
we want to have at least

224
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,180
integration of one time.

225
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,860
That means, I'm looking for the
relationship between positions and rates.

226
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,330
And it happens, you've done this,
high school physics problems.

227
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,620
Bouncing balls,
perfectly elastic bouncing ball, right?

228
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,490
The total energy has to be preserved.

229
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,380
It's a conservative system.

230
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,340
So therefore, we have our
potential energy of the ball, and

231
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,750
we have the kinetic energy.

232
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,730
And as you're up,
you have a lot of potential energy.

233
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,602
No kinetic energy.

234
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:13,260
Let go, it trades potential energy for

235
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,290
kinetic energies, but
the sum has to be the same.

236
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,780
Potential energy always
depends on position.

237
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,380
Never rates.

238
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,238
Kinetic energy, you see the definition.

239
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:26,010
It's always ex dots, theta dots,
it's all the rate of the coordinates.

240
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,790
So if you're looking for a relationship,
and one of the homeworks asks you for

241
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,610
this in part B in particularly,

242
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,070
what's the relationship
between some states and rates?

243
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,160
Your first step shouldn't necessarily be
to try to integrate this equation once.

244
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,660
That might be quite hard.

245
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,000
The trick is you're going to look for
is the system conservative, and

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,190
if yes,
now we can look at the energy balance.

247
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,420
So people was talking
earlier about energy,

248
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,757
this is typically where I use energy
systems and I can come up with directly

249
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:58,310
in analytic, at this angle what
is my rate going to have to be?

250
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,420
It's good conservative.

251
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,480
Now in this system there's
no lateral friction.

252
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,410
There's nothing doing work on the system
it's just a conservative one.

253
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,820
And this point here is not doing work
because this point is not moving

254
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,870
up and down.

255
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,500
Work is typically force
times distance moved and

256
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,160
this point is not moving
in this direction.

257
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,810
So this force end also.

258
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,710
This system is conservative.

259
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,640
And we can use conservation.

260
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,900
So this part should hopefully be boring.

261
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,980
Very simple, mgh, right?

262
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,400
Or this case, y,
we have it as in terms of the angle theta.

263
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,070
I know what the potential
energy is of this rod.

264
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,580
I need the total mass of this rod,
the moment arm,

265
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,180
the height of the surface, I've got that.

266
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,520
The kinetic energy,
now remember how do I get this?

267
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,120
Kinetic energy, like momentum, I can break
up as the kinetic energy of the center of

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,860
mass plus the kinetic energy
about the center of mass.

269
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,080
For weird complicated tumbling things like
this I really recommend that approach.

270
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Sometimes there are shortcuts with
other stuff that you can quickly do but

271
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,060
this is a way that's very rigorous, you
won't double count terms all of a sudden.

272
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,180
So the kinetic energy,
all the center of mass is mass

273
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,350
over 2 times the only
velocity we'll have is y dot.

274
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,420
And we know how to relate
y dot to theta dot right,

275
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,100
by using that earlier geometry
expression and differentiating.

276
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,720
And then here is the moment
over 2 times theta dot squared.

277
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,590
That's the one-half omega
transpose i omega but

278
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,370
put back into everything's about E3.

279
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,980
And it all simplifies down to
the simple scalar equation.

280
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,200
So we've got that.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,420
So you plug in that kinematic
relation between y dot and

282
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,730
theta theta dot simplify.

283
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,700
This is what you end up with.

284
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,520
So you do something very similar
in the homework to this.

285
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,240
So now we have kinetic energy and
potential energy and

286
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,640
if you sum the two up, I'm seeing
initially this rod is standing up,

287
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,260
and yes, something has to disturb it but

288
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,250
the disturb it's been
treating us infinitesimal.

289
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,540
So the total energy is basically
just the initial potential.

290
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,280
And then something turns it ever so
slightly and it will start to slip, right?

291
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,210
And so the initial one is this.

292
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,520
And then we want to look at what is
the relationship at a later time so now

293
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,380
we know at a later time we plug in this
plus this has to always be equal to this.

294
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,340
This is the total energy system.

295
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,550
So no matter how far you slipped
of whatever angle you're at,

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,150
I can come up with a relationship.

297
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,660
And in fact, solve for the theta
dot which we do here analytically.

298
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,120
So energy's become very powerful
expressions that we can use in these

299
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,350
systems to actually predict some great
relationships to states as well.

300
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,490
If you looked at the prior
differential equations,

301
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,910
I would challenge anybody
to just glance at this.

302
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,710
And then predict that this is how
states and rates have to relate.

303
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,970
It's not intuitive,
that's why we have these principles,

304
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,260
these mathematical processes
in there in place, to do that.

305
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,720
So anyway that kind of wraps that one up.

306
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,240
Any questions on this example?

307
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,880
So when you solve this equations,
and there's a few in the homework,

308
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,710
if you want to look for h dot equal to l,
but apply it about points that make sense.

309
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,790
Either center of mass,
that's often a very good place to start.

310
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,450
Or you might find that
inertial point as well.

311
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,420
And that might,
both of those equations might give

312
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,940
you all the information you need.

313
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,960
The other one that we have is
F = m a of the center of mass,

314
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,780
that's the super particle theorem.

315
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,530
Between the combinations of that you
should always get all the states,

316
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,449
everything that you need.

317
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,200
If you have multiple kinematic states,
it's only one degree of freedom look for

318
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,650
the geometric relationship.

319
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,650
How does theta relate to y or z or
whatever you introduced, all right?

320
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,490
And if the statement is somehow
relates states to rates

321
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,000
immediately think energies.

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,290
Look for the system most likely
to system is conservative.

323
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,210
And that allows you to exploit
conservation of energy in some way and

324
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,037
come up with these relationships, okay?

325
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:06,810
Good, so that's good stop, not,
well for that topic that ends there.

326
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,480
We've got two minutes, that's good.

327
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,020
Well let's do a quick thought experiment.

328
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,590
So now what we'll move next
into is torque free motion.

329
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,670
Daniel already mentioned earlier that if
its torque free motion certain special

330
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,510
things happen.

331
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,470
And in fact,
spacecraft once deployed from a rocket,

332
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,590
the initial stage is always
tumbling in one way or a manner.

333
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,850
And then you have to recover,
maybe we use magnetic torque bars or

334
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,910
we use thrusters or
reaction wheels, or something.

335
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,782
And we want to go positive.

336
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:35,414
Or these all these different challenges.

337
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:39,099
And even otherwise, you don't have
a situation typically where you're

338
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,904
continuously controlling attitude
because you just run out of resources,

339
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,016
even with reaction that
only use electrical energy.

340
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,590
It's a lot of effort.

341
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,160
You try to exploit as much you
can the natural dynamics, and

342
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,450
the natural dynamics is no torque,
it's just there.

343
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,500
So can we come up with
spacecraft that spin?

344
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,960
And people do that quite often.

345
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,300
They spin stabilize a single rigid body.

346
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,910
Or we'll be looking at dual spinners that
means we have multiple parts that spin,

347
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,820
but without any feedback.

348
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,080
And then multiple parts that's basically
a stepping stone into reaction wheels,

349
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,000
momentum exchange devices,
which we'll derive afterwards and

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,840
stay up there as well.

351
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,220
So that's kind of the motivation for why
do we want to look at torque free motions?

352
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,010
Really a classic problem, even with three
axis control these days you still want to

353
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,960
understand the different modes.

354
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,640
Why are some motions stable?

355
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,270
Why are some motion unstable?

356
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,820
And one of the equilibria spin conditions.

357
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,340
And if I put it in a particular spin,
will it just stay there or

358
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,510
will it wobble out of that spin and
go and get in the way?

359
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,350
And one way we can investigate that
ends up being angular momentum.

360
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,070
The angular momentum vector H of a rigid
body, we know if it's torque-free, H dot

361
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,620
has to be equal to 0 which immediately
gives us a constraint equation.

362
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,540
But this first cut at it though
is very complicated because

363
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,380
if I do everything in the inertia frame,
I will get three components.

364
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,420
They all have to ce zero.

365
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,902
That's great but your momentum in
the body frame, if I have a principal

366
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:11,999
coordinate frame, is simply i 1 omega 1,
i 2 omega 2, i 3 omega 3, right?

367
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,832
We mentioned principal coordinate frame
that inertia tension that's just diagonal.

368
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:17,150
So it becomes a very simple product.

369
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,830
h is equal to i omega.

370
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,350
But then we have to map this
into the inertial frame.

371
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,010
And here I'm using [INAUDIBLE] in
terms of three to one Euler angles.

372
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,970
And immediately,
you get all these relationships.

373
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,720
But you can see there's tons of sines and
cosines and omegas and

374
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,810
everything varies with time.

375
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,250
And true, that's a constraint, but

376
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,200
it's very had to wrap your brain around
that and get some analytic insight.

377
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,360
So next time when we start off
we're going to start here and

378
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,824
I'm going to show you a different approach
which leads to the pole hold methods.

379
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,600
Those of you who have taken 3200 have
seen a little of this stuff already.

380
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,488
But it's a classic approach in
how we can discuss stability, but

381
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,969
we'll take it all a step
further then from that as well.
