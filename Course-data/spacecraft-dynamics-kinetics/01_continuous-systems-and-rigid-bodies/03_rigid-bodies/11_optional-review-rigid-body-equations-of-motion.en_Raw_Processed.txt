last time, we derived equations 
motion a rigid body 
i got little cube here, 
somewhat rigid right 
we find equations 
motion a rigid body, spencer 
you read much 
you use super particle theorem this 
center mass rigid, so 
center mass shouldnt 
changing position 
true, 
if you worry translational part 
this stage class, really 
talking rigid bodies, 
going to start dropping 
translational, 
if i will make explicit 
so if im talking 
equations motion, 
im really talking 
rotational side 
so we find rotational 
side equation 
we actually looking 
whats variable 
yeah, actually looking 
omega dot, right 
thats the, 
omega is already a rate information so 
omega dot is acceleration 
thats angular acceleration 
we we integrate 
so whereas translation f equals ma, 
you go straight forces to 
acceleration position description, 
in attitude we this kinetics 
kinematics always broken 
we somehow added to coordinate rates 
related to omega, an omega dot 
relates to forces torques 
everything acting it, right 
so you this clear 
split that you to 
so here looking 
second part, kinetics 
whats fundamental property, 
robert, that we use to drive this 
cough 
inaudible 
principle we apply 
conservation angular momentum 
is conserved 
is rotational 
motion a rigid body, 
a conserved 
angular momentum 

ansel, you help 
torquefree 
if torquefree, 
i didnt mention torquefree motion 
so lets assume torque, 
we need 
we get to an omega dot 
mariel, principles we 
use to get equations motion 
like h equals derivative h time, 
plus, omega cross 
okay, youve taken 
derivative already, 
is inertial derivative 
angular momentum system 
right hand side 
yeah, l 
l, there we go, right 
so like f equals ma, this is good 
a continuum if we center mass, or, 
here implied if i dont write a sub c, 
always implied to center 
mass in this notation, right 
so we use hl, key features is, 
this dot to an inertial derivative, 
like f equals ma, 
to inertial acceleration 
this l is net sum 
external ports acting system, 
right writing l 
later on, that could gravity gradient 
torques, could drag torques, 
could control torques 
thrusters, something like that 
many ways to break up, good 
so lets review quickly, this is going to 
a good, is h a rigid body 
right, we said this thing wasnt 
blob jello flexing, solid, 
h become 
it, brett 
sure 
is angular momentum 
go back to sophomore level class, 
fixed axis rotation 
is angular momentum 
is inertia times 
yes, inertia times 
regular rate 
yes, 
this is d version that 
i omega, right 
review this stuff, otherwise, hour 
minutes youre going to 
time to remember things, okay 
getting to that exam point 
so if h is this, this is inertia 
tensor, right, we talked that 
this is written is in a coordinate 
frame independent way, you to 
make sure if this is in b frame, 
this needs to also in b frame 
this gives you answer in 
a rotating frame b frame 
you could pick frame you wish 
good, we need to h dot 
so mariel actually already 
got us this track 
we need an inertial derivative 
we choose to take a body 
frame derivative h 
i wont go details, 
we that last time 
this is a review 
we choose to 
a body frame derivative 
kevin 
is that going to make life 
easier dealing this term 
lets break up, 
youre going to chain rule 
youre going to 
body frame derivative 
this tensor times 
omega plus inertial 
tensor times cough 
anglular velocity 
thats h dot, 
let just, scratch that 
doing, choosing to 
body frame derivative h 
so kevin, body frame 
derivative i omega easier 
derivative 
inertia matrix is going to zero 
exactly, see body, 
every point to here, if you lock 
arms you start rotating, youre 
rotating that arm is always to left 
mass distribution, 
moments you computed, 
you got inertia tenser, 
theyre fixed, seen body 
seen you guys i tumble an object, 
mass distribution is clearly changing 
so if you inertial 
derivative directly this, 
youd lots extra terms 
youd to map to 
inertial frame, dcn, dcn dots, 
dcn dots r minus omega til dcs 
looks much complicated, 
simple answer 
this ends being, 
seen body observer, 
so thats we this, 
happens to this derivative 
anybody remember 
happens to that, yes 
omega dot, 
inertial frame 
this is really, 
if i write omega, short 
omega b relative to n 
typically dealing b n 
next several weeks so 
this becomes much easier 
b n frame derivative 
same, cross product always drops 
good, so if you this stuff, 
h dot mariel pointing out, 
really ends giving you i omega dot plus 
i to transport theorem so 
i an omega crossed h 
h is i omega, thats equal to l 
there we go 
is this true 
particular coordinate frames, 
is this true frame 
daniel, you think 
an inertial frame 
thats two frames 
yeah, this is really written in 
a frame agnostic way 
we havent picked anything, we solved 
it, like we earlier positions 
angular velocities 
theyre vectors, we start adding, 
subtracting without ever 
specifying el really point 
you want to get a numerical answer, 
well you to resolve geometry 
right stuff 
so this is kind way, 
this is a very, like a vector 
we vectors tensors 
theyre written in a frame agnostic way 
you math, make 
sure everythings in frame 
especially we get to control 
side, well this a lot 
this is well 
deriving controls, 
you code it, 
you to go, wait a minute 
this will make a r, thats coming in, 
thats in r frame 
this stuff is in b frame 
well implied, youre going to 
to translations 
matt 
i writing you wrote it, 
cough 
i dont remember last time 
second term in 
that l equation come 
this one 
yeah 
i need h dot equal to l 
basically we is, we take 
body frame derivative h, 
i need inertial derivative, so 
you need omega crossed h well 
omega cross, h is i omega, 
omega cross h is 
thing omega tilde i omega 
thats form we typically see 
cool, thank you 
thats l 
so you see, in exam this is something 
that shouldnt take you three 
minutes if you know youre 
theres lots subtleties, 
if you jump to answer, 
answers in equation 
sheet you guys 
giving answer will 
give you zero points in exam 
path details 
so make sure every time we go 
this, hopefully 
will sink in 
make sure you get this stuff 
so, good, we specific frames 
that make inertia tensor diagonal 
trevor, we call frames 
principle frames 
principle coordinate frames, 
there an infinity 
principle coordinate frames 
you say 
you slow 
laugh 
well, a particular application, 
a particular rigid body, 
itll 
so, heres a nice rigid body, 
there infinity 
principal coordinate frames 
mandara, you think so 

we one axis 
symmetry axis, 
we two in 
plane orthogonal 
okay if a cube 

see, a sudden, 
ooh, wait a minute 
laugh 
if a cube happens to 
principle inertias 
theyre 
yeah, theyre repeated 
hm, right, easy 
questions in morning 
laugh 
i need coffee 
okay, so if theyre same, 
make you hesitate sudden 
vectors, uniqueness 
yeah, you to kind of, 
eigenvectors form different 
ways that you map to there 
you to take a closer look 
if a body, 
lets go to a simpler body 
this one three distinct inertias 
definitely rigid, right 
you going to 
one principle coordinate frame 
bryan, you dont think so 
i think you probably, yeah, 
i think you probably could 
depends symmetry object 
this is it, im showing you object, 
theres depends, is 
right, if you take moment 
inertia around one 
principal axis, negative moment 
inertia one 
right, every body, 
doesnt actually depend shape, 
every body least principal 
axis that will diagonalize 
maybe an infinity, if a cylinder, 
thats kind you guys thinking 
of, if a cylinder, theres definitely 
an infinity ways that you 
if you even three discrete 
ones like this, something 
amorphous will still three 
principal inertias, principal axis 
you pick eigenvectors, 
you remember wait a minute, 
i a positive direction 
says this isnt principle axis 
maybe you want a frame points towards 
tail thats docking 
porter is you want to port towards, 
find points towards nose 
this is a flight frame you 
kind worry youre flying 
theres immediately, well theres two 
options theres another one 
so theres a kind 
permutation you go through, 
theres an infinity principle 
frames that a general body would 
theres definitely a finite set 
you always rearrange whats 
first, whats second, 
whats third 
plus minus, 
always keep righthanded, right 
so yeah, 
there several that we pick 
so if we look that, 
we went that actually 
if this is diagonal, simplify 
to three scalar equations we saw, 
we that 
now, last question we 
we covered integration 
if you want to integrate complete 
motion we something 
we give a spin tumbles 
we numerically solve this 
tosh, help us out, 
we write an integrator 
a complete d attitude dynamics 
so youd look omega dot 
inaudible 
besides omega dot, 
else you need 
describes full 
attitude state a rigid body 
i guess, inaudible general forces 
nope, im asking 
describes, coordinates 
you need to fully describe 
orientation a rigid body 
theres answer 
mrps, i would say 
mrps, 
a good answer, definitely 
laugh 
thanks sucking up, i appreciate 
laugh 
so you need an attitude measure, right 
like if you f equals ma, 
spring mass to amperes system, 
think back to that form 
okay, weve got x double dots, 
thats nice 
i have, every integrator writes 
things back first order form 
so you define that x is equal to x, 
x is equal to x dot 
x dot is equal, 
you that classic stuff 
we to thing attitude, 
we different equations 
so we still need attitude measure, 
that integrator you wrote 
earlier in classes, right 
so you something 
mrps quaternion 
whatever you wish to, 
attitude measure 
so that means you a state 
vector that is going to a, 
if an mrp six one 
if a quaternion a seven one, 
right, 
this is we to propagate forward 
otherwise this is much you 
before, you current states 
you compute k is 
equal to derivative 
so if x dot is equal to an f function, 
depending these, right 
first order one would give 
whats derivative states 
xn is xn 
k times delta 
you a fourth 
order cut 
whatever you wish to integrate, right 
integration that 
youre in problems, 
youre expanding now, we 
to keep track attitude rates 
there discussion that 
we regarding, could we integrate 
attitude separately kinetics 
equation, omega dot equation 
so, nick, you remember arguments 
attitude actually couple 
this differential equation 
cough i guess you could 
single omega dot term 
no, omega is state 
not, 
i guess i dont 
understand question 
attitude 
couple this equation 
this differential equation 
depend instantaneous attitude 
no, well, i confident 
confident, 
i give you kudos that 
completely wrong, 
confident, absolutely 
attitude couple this, 
where, right 
omega thats another state, 
thats coupling 
a derivative stuff 
interia tensor, well, 
that doesnt really, 
i dont different mass 
i point differently 
a rigid body, 
doesnt matter orientation 
thing left is l, 
attitude couple l 
physical 
examples torques 
daniel 
torques added to 
independently 
yes 
drag, srp 
drag, srp, gravity, gradience, 
even feedback control, 
you will see much, 
thats couples 
so while theres instances you 
could solve omega first 
solve 
attitude you kind 
i gave you omegas essentially 
in earlier homeworks, right 
you code it, 
i highly encourage to avoid that, 
give general answer, 
simple enough to 
you want to solve attitude 
omegas simultaneously 
later in class we even add 
stuff like reaction wheels or, 
that quickly moves to , 
follow class 
matt 
cough excuse me, 
i a question that 
equation last page 
so you asking that 
question i thinking that 
you pointing towards is 
this is an inertial derivative 
inertial frame i will change 
is constant 
we derived in body frame 
tensors 
i mean if you say constant i to 
ask constant seen frame 
inertia is a matrix like a dcm, 
a three three grouping 
cosines that we picked, right 
we could picked something else 
this is really fundamentally a tensor 
means like a vector it, 
you numerically evaluate you 
to pick a coordinate frame 
so i said look this a completely 
vectorial thing i take body frames 
derivative this 
happens is, 
well body frame derivative h, 
h is i omega 
you break two parts, right 
here, i immediately say this part is 
going to go to zero, simplifies 
this derivative body frame is 
thing inertial derivative, 
we discussed 
so this h b frame derivative becomes 
nothing i omega dot, thats this part 
could then, to get inertial 
derivative, i to add omega cross h, 
is equivalent to here 
so this gives answer 
ive never actually picked 
a particular courting frame 
remember using 
transport theorem 
we say taking derivative 
vector seen this frame 
doesnt mean you to 
write that vector in that frame 
often we have, 
thats weve chosen that frame 
here, we havent chosen b frame 
derivative we a particular 
coordinate frame, weve chosen a b frame 
derivative seen b frame, 
mass distribution a rigid body is 
constant that derivative goes to zero 
i think this confusion, 
matter i is, constant 
constant, exactly 
shape asymmetries 
whatevers going on, 
this is always true, right 
thing is, rigid 
thats single rigid body 
we this in a general way 
you see this looks suspiciously simple 
in undergraduate stuff we go this 
very, quickly 
this, theres 
layers details that top 
this that take a little bit 
time to sink in, so, work this
