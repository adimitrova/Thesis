Hi and welcome to the first
segment of spacecraft kinetics.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,850
In this section we're going to be
talking about equations of motion of

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,120
a space object.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,000
In fact, we're going to
start with basic principles.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,130
We're going to go to a deformable body,
something that can change shape, and

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,430
then we're going to move and freeze it to
a rigid body, which is very typical for

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,910
many a spacecraft mission.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,670
In all these applications, we're studying
angular momentum on how this stuff spins.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,080
We're looking at the kinetic
energy of these objects.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,200
And we're also showing you how to
use these principles to develop

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,080
equations of motion.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,230
Why do you need this?

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,064
The equations of motion is a fundamental
property you have to analytically derive,

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:42,792
so then you can demur to simulate it and

15
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,963
predict what the space
craft will actually do.

16
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,746
This is also often used for
mission analysis tools.
