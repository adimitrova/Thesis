1
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,420
We're going to go to kinetics.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,500
We focused a lot on how
to describe orientations.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,595
And there's lots of sets, actually,

4
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:17,031
there's an infinity of
different attitude sets.

5
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,390
And they all have benefits and drawbacks.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,490
Now we're going to work
on the full dynamics.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,806
And that means we're going to focus
on mass, inertia, forces, torque,

8
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:25,150
that kind of stuff.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,880
And how do we find,
ultimately always, omega dot.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,630
That's kind of what we're after,
fundamentally.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,483
So, here's some topics, we're going to
start out with a continuous system.

12
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:36,664
Again, that's from chapter two.

13
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:39,760
We're going to jump straight
to that formulation.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,030
Derive some fundamental properties.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,920
Do everything in a vectorial
format formulation.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,995
That's kind of important and nice.

17
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,412
So some of you may not
have seen this before.

18
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:51,490
Then we're going to freeze that blob
of jelly, basically, into a rigid body.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,350
Some of the things will simplify.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,660
And you have to be very careful
as to which terms simplify.

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,320
Momentum, energy, all those things
that we use to derive equations.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,380
And we'll talk about the inertia tensor,
energetic equations.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,520
We talk about stability
of torque-free spins,

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,420
the different equilibrias that we have.

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,840
Why does a body happy, happy to
tumble in one set of direction and

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,990
then other directions if this goes crazy?

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,770
All that stuff will come from there.

28
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,065
Dual spin spacecraft, those are,
used to be more common platform.

29
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,480
You still see them occasionally.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,810
But they used to make all
the geosats that way.

31
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,620
With, basically, you want the antenna
facing at the earth once per day and

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,440
with revolution.

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,970
because it's a geo.
It's always point at us.

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,121
And then the other part is
spun up at a different rate.

35
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,401
I think Cassini is also a dual spinner.

36
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,828
It's a big antenna platforms that
are spinning at a different rate than

37
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:39,700
the rest.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,916
And there's instability
that comes out of this.

39
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,350
So this is just basically
a system of rigid bodies.

40
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,850
So what we've done here is
going to be a single rigid body.

41
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,916
And then we have two rigid bodies.

42
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,493
Another one that we want to
derive is gravity gradient torch.

43
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:56,230
Then we'll go back to very much f=ma,
look at the field equations, expand them.

44
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,250
Why do you truncate?

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,510
Because there's simple questions like,

46
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,460
I know that if I change my orbit,
I will change my attitude torque.

47
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,990
The further I am from the Earth,
the smaller that torque will be,

48
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,250
because gravity's smaller, so differential
gravity's going to be smaller.

49
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,970
But is the inverse true?

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,550
If I change my orientation,
do I impact my orbit?

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,690
And that's the kind of
stuff we'll see there.

52
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,650
And so,
we'll go through in great detail a lot,

53
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,090
again in a vectorial formulation and
go there.

54
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,542
But that's kind of the basic dynamics.

55
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:34,018
Later on in class we will also do
spacecraft with n-reaction wheels.

56
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,360
In fact, variable speed CNGs,
which then contain reaction wheels.

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,970
But that will be at a later stage.
