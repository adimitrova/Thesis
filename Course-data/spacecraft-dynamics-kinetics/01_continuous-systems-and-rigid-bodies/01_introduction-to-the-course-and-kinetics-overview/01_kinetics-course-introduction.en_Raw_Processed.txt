hi, welcome to this course 
sequence spacecraft kinetics 
name is hanspeter schaub 
im a professor here 
university colorado boulder 
sequence will four components 
first component want to 
talk continued mechanics 
also rigid body dynamics 
we developed equations 
motion basic principles 
next component is going to look 
a rigid body a space craft 
study stabilized 
we looking torque free motions 
equilibrium exists 
ones stable 
third component talks 
gravity gradients 
this is a common method stabilizing 
space craft without 
active feedback 
well looking derivation 
this gravity gradient torque, 
also force, stability, 
equilibrium 
last, fourth component, 
is going to look a spacecraft 
multiple momentum exchange 
device developed 
in fact, youve developed a 
general formulation variable speed 
control moment gyros 
we simplify formulations 
cmgs reaction wheels
