Hi, and welcome to this course
sequence on spacecraft kinetics.

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,370
My name is Hanspeter Schaub and

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm a professor here at
The University of Colorado Boulder.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,980
The sequence will have four components.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,870
The first component we're want to
talk about continued mechanics and

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,560
also rigid body dynamics.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,600
How we developed equations of
motion from basic principles?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,840
The next component is going to look
at a rigid body of a space craft and

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,450
study how it's being stabilized.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,420
We are looking at torque free motions and
equilibrium exists and

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,940
which ones are stable.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,670
The third component talks
about gravity gradients.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,630
This is a common method of stabilizing
the space craft without having

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,620
active feedback.

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,130
And we'll be looking at the derivation
of this gravity gradient torque, but

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,700
also the force, its stability,
and equilibrium.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,820
The last, the fourth component,
is going to look at a spacecraft which has

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,370
multiple momentum exchange
device developed.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,450
In fact, you've developed a very
general formulation with variable speed

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,470
control moment gyros.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,740
And then we can simplify the formulations
for CMGs and reaction wheels.
