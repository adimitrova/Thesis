hi, and welcome to this course sequence on spacecraft kinetics.
my name is hanspeter schaub and i'm a professor here at the university of colorado boulder.
the sequence will have four components.
the first component we're want to talk about continued mechanics and also rigid body dynamics.
how we developed equations of motion from basic principles?
the next component is going to look at a rigid body of a space craft and study how it's being stabilized.
we are looking at torque free motions and equilibrium exists and which ones are stable.
the third component talks about gravity gradients.
this is a common method of stabilizing the space craft without having active feedback.
and we'll be looking at the derivation of this gravity gradient torque, but also the force, its stability, and equilibrium.
the last, the fourth component, is going to look at a spacecraft which has multiple momentum exchange device developed.
in fact, you've developed a very general formulation with variable speed control moment gyros.
and then we can simplify the formulations for cmgs and reaction wheels.
