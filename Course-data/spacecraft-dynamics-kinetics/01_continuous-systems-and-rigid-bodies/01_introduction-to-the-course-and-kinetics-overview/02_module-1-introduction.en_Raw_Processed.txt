hi welcome to first 
segment spacecraft kinetics 
in this section going to 
talking equations motion 
a space object 
in fact, going to 
start basic principles 
going to go to a deformable body, 
something that change shape, 
going to move freeze to 
a rigid body, is typical 
many a spacecraft mission 
in applications, studying 
angular momentum this stuff spins 
looking kinetic 
energy objects 
also showing you to 
use principles to develop 
equations motion 
you need this 
equations motion is a fundamental 
property you to analytically derive, 
so you demur to simulate 
predict space 
craft will actually 
this is also often used 
mission analysis tools
