going to go to kinetics 
we focused a lot 
to describe orientations 
theres lots sets, actually, 
theres an infinity 
different attitude sets 
benefits drawbacks 
going to work 
full dynamics 
that means going to focus 
mass, inertia, forces, torque, 
that kind stuff 
we find, 
ultimately always, omega dot 
thats kind after, 
fundamentally 
so, heres topics, going to 
start a continuous system 
again, thats chapter two 
going to jump straight 
to that formulation 
derive fundamental properties 
everything in a vectorial 
format formulation 
thats kind important nice 
so you may 
seen this 
going to freeze that blob 
jelly, basically, a rigid body 
things will simplify 
you to careful 
to terms simplify 
momentum, energy, things 
that we use to derive equations 
well talk inertia tensor, 
energetic equations 
we talk stability 
torquefree spins, 
different equilibrias that we 
a body happy, happy to 
tumble in one set direction 
directions if this goes crazy 
that stuff will come there 
dual spin spacecraft, are, 
used to common platform 
you still see occasionally 
used to make 
geosats that way 
with, basically, you want antenna 
facing earth per day 
revolution 
a geo 
always point us 
part is 
spun a different rate 
i think cassini is also a dual spinner 
a big antenna platforms that 
spinning a different rate 
rest 
theres instability 
that comes this 
so this is basically 
a system rigid bodies 
so weve done here is 
going to a single rigid body 
we two rigid bodies 
another one that we want to 
derive is gravity gradient torch 
well go back to much fma, 
look field equations, expand 
you truncate 
theres simple questions like, 
i know that if i change orbit, 
i will change attitude torque 
i earth, 
smaller that torque will be, 
gravitys smaller, so differential 
gravitys going to smaller 
is inverse true 
if i change orientation, 
i impact orbit 
thats kind 
stuff well see there 
so, 
well go in great detail a lot, 
in a vectorial formulation 
go there 
thats kind basic dynamics 
later in class we will also 
spacecraft nreaction wheels 
in fact, variable speed cngs, 
contain reaction wheels 
that will a later stage
