okay, lets a brief review 
theres a lot little math steps, 
that we went last time 
definitely steps i feel, 
you able to scratch, 
basic principle 
going to cover 
nuances that we go 
so 
inaudible actually, 
going to go here, thatll work 
so one first things we 
looking is, weve got a blob dn 
this blob a center mass, 
we inertial frame 
this is center 
mass position vector 
this little dn element 
a little r vector, 
capital r is to find us 
inertial position that element 
i think solved 
thats kind we started 
so lets see 
cody, is super particle theorem 
quite sure 
inaudible last night 
fresh 
laugh 
yeah, 
i watched video late last night, 
wasnt 
you slept video 
last night youre saying 
laugh yeah 
i see, okay 
good, is super particle, andre 
super particle theorem 
i couldnt tell you 
you watch video 
a long week 
okay, super particle theorem 
acceleration body 
becomes external forces 
right, so actually close 
you mean 
acceleration body 
noise we to 
specific 
right, this is a continuum 
this could fuel slashing in space, 
a jello 
you know astronauts eat jello in space, 
so theres jello wobbling 
space station im sure somewhere 
this stuff 
whats dynamics things 
so you say acceleration jello, 
part jello 
inaudible 
hmm 
every part jello 

cant right, right 
jello may left side is 
perfectly steady, side is 
wobbling, two seconds later 
will shift change 
so you cant every part 
jello acceleration 
even if rigid, this pen 
acceleration everywhere 
no, right 
so right away that statement, 
youre right track 
brett, right 
center mass 
center mass 
so super particle theorem says, 
that total mass this system 
times rc double dot f 
david, goes this f 
basically an integral 
particles, 
sum forces 
particles in body 
yeah 
robert, you specific 
this is true 
not, theres to this 
theres refinements that we 
forces we to really 
consider we this integration 
external forces 
external 
happens to internal forces 
russell 
you sum body, 
happens to internal forces 
inaudible 
sorry 
cancel 
cancel other, exactly 
right 
so this bolt a force one newton, 
another plate is pushing 
vice versa, plate is 
a minus one newton force somewhere 
things will 
sum to zero 
so internal force is completely banished 
external forces, so this is 
really df external thats kind 
you think this, 
integrated whole body 
this is we derived last time 
basically a powerful thing 
well using one examples, 
youll using in 
current homeworks well 
so without knowing whats going 
fuel slosh stuff 
if you know external 
influences space craft, 
regardless flexing is 
going inside in deformations, 
especially if rigid well 
course, you predict 
center mass must 
center mass motion 
spacecraft, 
thats basically translation, 
orbits problem 
so we account that 
theres ways that attitude 
couples this total force 
you think an example where, you 
need to keep track shape is 
orientation an object, 
to figure external force is 
daniel 
drag 
drag, atmospheric drag right 
so there particular 
types disturbances, 
acting a space craft that 
depend orientation 
if this shape in space, 
this shape in space well see in a few 
weeks, gravity gradients 
make a big difference right 
so there external influences 
that matter shape 
so become harder obviously to track, 
you 
to track orientations, 
codes immediately slow way down, 
attitude you to much 
smaller time steps orbits typically, 
so lots lots challenges 
this is 
this is super particle theorem 
we center mass definition, 
mrc equal to this 
this one them, right 
basically, center mass 
a blob is mass averaged location, 
thats one way to look 
instead an integral, 
putting in a summation sign, 
looks like classic 
statics book that you 
mass averaged location 
definition 
that we used again, 
center mass a property 
thibault, you remember 
weighted average 
positions r plus small r 
thats a good answer 
yeah there we go 
so this is average position 
relative to center mass, 
to add to zero 
basically 
balance point right 
you put that little lever right 
there in center mass, 
youll able to balance something 
i cant im quite good 
enough this morning right 
something like that 
pen, i dont care 
laugh 
course i care 
so center mass definitions 
we said, 
we take two derivatives, 
put dots in here right 
this one thing we 
left hand side, 
if you take two inertial 
derivatives you get this 
we second derivative 
this integral rdm right 
here we ended 
this expression 
bret right, 
you that brought that question 
that an excellent question 
we take derivatives 
inside this interval, 
body if jello, 
boundary actually varies time 
if b is defined to this 
boundary actual jello 
so in textbook we have, 
theres actually a statement early in that 
paragraph that section saying hey, 
you body integrals 
integrals b, 
domain to carefully 
selected to encompass mass 
basically means is, 
you create b in this case 
a continuum is 
body surface 
you make a box bigger that 
this isnt a fluids continuum problem 
theres a mass flow air, 
plasma, 
something coming water, 
coming here 
a fixed shape 
stuff 
so you define bounds 
integrations to bigger, basically make 
big enough that matter 
worse case deflections are, 
youve got a bounding box 
thats big enough to cover 
so youre 
integrals afterwords, 
something times dm, here 
dm is simply going to zero 
if this stuff deforms encompasses it, 
sudden dm becomes non zero 
thats a way to look around 
this avoids reynolds transport theorem 
lightness stuff, that otherwise 
youd to use boundary 
again, this is a fixed shape 
adding, 
losing mass to system, 
looking 
deformations right 
so theres a discussion ahead 
coauthor, john jenkins 
i to give credit also to 
johnny hurtado, professor am, 
writes a lot analytical books 
pointed to good references 
this type derivative, we also call 
sometimes material time derivative, 
comoving time derivative 
youre really 
following dm element 
creating new dms 
theres a flow dms like in 
a fluid flow, that comes in 
surface area 
boundary, you change stuff 
theres mass flux coming in 
boundary either 
so lots different ways to look 
easiest explanation i think 
engineers is, 
this kind problems youve got a space 
craft flexing, youre getting 
equations motions, results ive 
shown classic definitely true 
this step theres 
subtleties there 
so brett good 
gold star 
asking right question analytical 
that hansel actually 
hansel 
i thought that you 
well gold star honesty 
so hansel, hes here today 
laugh 
well somebody 
right back there asked 
a great question, thank you 
that an issue 
i wanted to bring 
this is a subtlety, this is an easy 
way to look around that form continuum 
we turn rigid, this stuff 
is completely simple anyway 
results definitely hold 
even a continuum, results 
i showed you absolutely true 
if you derivations in 
books, theres lots little subtleties 
moving a derivative inside 
this differential operator, 
is something you always 
to carefully 
so i didnt a good answer last time, 
i a better answer 
so we derive this 
this gave us in end, 
this dfs this nothing 
a super particle theorem 
good, so we derive that 
now, lets review quickly 
angular momentum 
brian, a blob, you 
remember angular momentum 


there is external torques 
so, if youre saying if 
l is zero h dot 
so, a vectorial quantity 
right 
this becomes important 
so you say preserved, 
saying inertial derivative 
this vectorial quantity is zero 
so a constant seen 
an inertial observer 
we go equations motion 
today, you will see angle momentum 
expression, seen body fixed 
observer, is actually constant 
so body relative 
derivative is zero 
inertial derivative is zero 
is a really good integration check, 
you write in code 
every time stamp, 
recompute derivative 
outside derivative 
compute h 
map h, 
youre typically 
computing body frame, 
map everything end frame 
three end frame components, 
nice flat lines 
you get warm fuzzy feelings 
that youre right thing 
is this true 
is h dot equal to l 
ck 
is that always case 
accelerating 
center mass is accelerating 

center mass accelerating 
youre right track, 
youre talking wrong point 
we moments torques, 
we need to specify something 
robert 
center mass 
that one option 
we derived this h dot, we found 
h dot equal to l, plus something 
that something an rp minus rc 
so if point, 
taking moments in torques, 
is center mass 
that second part went to zero 
one is related to 
ck is talking 
there something inertial 
center mass 
inertial, really rp double log 
so if point youre 
taking moments is an inertial point, 
could stationary 
thats cool 
could moving a constant speed, 
also zero acceleration, 
this equation holds 
so thats an important thing, today you 
will see we get equations 
motion, especially a slender rod, 
in homework youre one 
thats tipping a point 
friction, well one, 
theres friction slides in place 
here well using 
super particle theorem, h dot l, 
we use h dot l we to make 
sure we center mass 
dynamical system, 
an inertially fixed point 
this will work right 
so good 
two important 
subtleties that we needed 
this is h dot 
lets step back talk h 
somebody tell something h 
a blob jello 
right fundamental definition is, 
this integral a domain b 
you position crossed 
linear momentum that one right 
is this form we typically use 
evan 
we usually use sigma form, 
defines that difference between r rp 
right we make that one general 
theres something else though 
we break this angular momentum, 
thing kinetic energy, 
blobs 
theres a way that we actually 
separate two different chunks 
you remember, evan 
id to look to tell you 
i think we 
in words 
in words we see 
we separate 
two integrals 
positions crossed, 
position acceleration 
lucas, help 
id to look notes 
matt 
so going to define r in terms 
little r r center mass, 
inaudible integrals 
one cancels to zero 
yep stuff definitely equals 
to zero, left two parts, 
you guys right track 
two, angular momentum 
shayla, you remember 
inaudible 
is equal to inaudible 
across r 
so you sub that in 
is this one true 
inaudible 
yes 
is this true a blob 
maurice 
im full good questions every morning 
laugh 
this a surprise, 
this many weeks semester 
knew going to ask 
questions last lecture 
laugh 
i know 
inaudible couldnt foresee this 
is this true, people 
a rigid body 
rigid body 
true a rigid body, thats 
in fact inaudible go to rigid bodies 
already answering 
questions that, right 
people sometimes quickly assume 
to look this stuff 
direct to deriving exam 
r dot rigid, r dot must zero 

little particle is going to 
inertial derivative this vector 
growing, shrinking, 
rigid 
is nonzero tumbling 
so this part is true if rigid 
let make that next to 
if rigid 
but, matt saying, 
we make this thing, you plug in, 
you stuff 
okay 
somebody, somebody here surely 
remembers we break this 
two chunks 
that minus 
yeah, is that part 
there is cross product 
no, dm 
okay 
so this is second part 
again, if you get this form 
inaudible, you assumed 
sound okay, so im hearing a lot 
subresults that true rigid 
lets go to a blob 
h is equal to r crossed, r dot dm 
you rewrite this 
essentially rc, is that 
okay 
crossed mrc dot plus 
integral little r dot dm 
is this form convenient 
is first part 
andrew 
inaudible angular momentum 
center mass point 
right, so 
this is inertial point 
something that weve picked, right 
there moments that 
r is defined relative, rc r 
right 
so important problems, 
you start fundamentals 
youre always going to get this, 
well this is a blob, 
i position 
vectors inaudible inertial 
we break like matt explained, 
relative to center, 
motion center mass plus 
motion relative to center mass 
momentum, you want to write 
exactly way 
is that convenient 
this in essence, 
gives you translational side 
thats orbit problem 
inaudible flying space, right 
so, you separate moment to orbital, 
a momentum is essentially this part 
this part contains type motion 
griffin 
attitude 
attitude motion, else 
this is blob still 
deformation 
deformations, right 
so shape changes, 
fuel sloshing, flexing panels, 
this kind stuff would 
also accounted in this 
so this is anglular momentum 
center mass 
this is angular 
momentum center mass 
thats important 
distinction we keep making 
so in this class we derive it, 
we get terms 
going to focus this part 
if you go look kinetic energy, 
we write that in 
much way 
we derive that, similar properties 
that we used, center mass 
properties terms drop out, 
you end getting kinetic energy 
center mass plus kinetic energy 
center mass, right 
so this is classic thing we 
keep doing,
