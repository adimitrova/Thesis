okay 
linear momentum, 
kind wrapping things 
blobs, since onto blobs 
linear momentum is always mass times 
velocity, is linear momentum 
a completely vectorial way in 
a blob you would mass is dm, 
velocity inertial is r dot, 
p is linear momentum 
so dp is linear momentum that 
differential element that you 
if you want total linear 
momentum a system, 
you to integrate body again, 
you plug in things 
rules, we will plug in, 
instead r we rc little r, 
we break this 
we pull this rc 
this integral now, hopefully 
boring you go yep, thats zero 
right, thats center mass property 
again, that ones going to vanish 
this one weve replaced total mass 
so thats 
so a blob, again, 
like super particle theorem, need to 
know is total mass system 
is center mass moving 
we know whats going 
if you differentiate it, this is 
you come newtons equation 
a constant mass solution 
so mass is preserved 
gaining 
losing mass in system 
taking inertial derivative 
linear momentum 
you plug that this equation, 
this r dot becomes an r double dot 
this is nothing force acting 
that element integrated a body 
you care 
external forces 
is a powerful statement 
so if you go to space station 
flew away earth 
shes going deep space 
astronauts in there a sudden 
start running a treadmill 
ever going to change 
centerofmass motion spacecraft 

may change orientation, 
may change shape 
internal forces 
never change linear momentum 
thats we saw in 
superparticle theorem, too, 
that external forces impact 
center mass evolves space 
so, this is a kind handy, 
handy, formula
