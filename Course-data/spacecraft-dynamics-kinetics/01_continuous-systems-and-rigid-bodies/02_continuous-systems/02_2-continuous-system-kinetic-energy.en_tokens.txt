let
us
do
some
more
fun
.
kinetic
energies
for
particles
,
you
guys
know
that
.
that
's
mass
over
two
times
velocity
squared
essentially
,
that
's
what
you
've
had
.
this
is
the
vectorial
form
of
that
.
i
have
dm
,
so
instead
of
mass
i
just
have
dm
over
two
.
that
's
essentially
what
that
does
.
times
my
inertial
speed
squared
.
i
'm
doing
this
in
a
vectorial
way
,
so
r
dot
is
my
,
you
know
if
r
is
my
inertial
position
vector
,
i
need
to
have
my
inertial
velocity
.
that
's
the
first
inertial
time
derivative
of
r
,
that
's
an
r
dot
.
i
'm
dotting
it
with
itself
,
that
's
going
to
give
me
my
inertial
velocity
magnitude
squared
.
it
's
just
a
vectorial
way
to
write
it
,
but
it
's
a
very
general
way
to
write
this
.
so
that
's
it
.
now
that
's
for
one
dm
,
i
need
it
for
the
whole
blob
.
you
simply
integrate
again
over
the
body
.
that
's
where
the
integral
comes
in
.
it
's
just
summing
them
all
up
.
so
good
,
now
we
have
kinetic
energy
.
that
's
not
the
most
convenient
form
.
we
do
n't
typically
write
it
this
way
because
it
's
kind
of
hard
.
we
would
like
to
break
it
up
in
terms
of
rc
and
kinetic
energy
off
the
center
of
mass
and
then
we
're
looking
at
kinetic
energy
about
the
center
of
mass
and
that
will
help
us
separate
rotational
stuff
,
deformational
stuff
and
translational
stuff
.
that
's
what
you
'll
see
popping
out
of
this
.
so
let
's
do
this
.
r
dot
.
r
was
defined
as
rc
+
r
,
so
r
dot
,
you
just
put
dots
everywhere
.
again
,
vectorial
form
,
dead
simple
,
right
.
the
3.6
comes
back
.
do
n't
do
part
b
any
more
.
do
part
a
where
we
only
take
time
derivatives
and
vectorial
parts
.
you
plug
this
in
and
you
carry
out
the
various
dot
products
.
you
guys
know
how
to
do
basic
dot
products
in
calculus
.
i
'm
not
going
to
do
that
again
.
so
we
end
up
with
these
terms
.
and
,
as
kevin
was
saying
earlier
,
in
these
body
intervals
,
anything
that
's
rc
and
rc
dot
,
those
are
all
going
to
be
things
that
are
fixed
over
the
body
interval
.
because
every
point
in
that
blob
has
the
same
center
of
mass
.
therefore
,
it
has
the
same
center
of
mass
velocity
.
so
we
can
always
treat
these
quantities
as
constants
over
the
integration
.
so
when
you
carry
,
you
know
,
this
is
a
step
i
'm
not
doing
here
,
i
'm
purposely
not
,
because
i
want
you
guys
to
,
you
should
do
this
yourself
.
[
cough
]
run
through
the
notes
,
that
's
how
it
's
going
to
stick
.
if
we
do
that
,
these
can
be
pulled
out
.
same
thing
gets
pulled
out
here
.
and
at
the
end
there
's
a
factor
of
two
with
the
half
that
cancels
,
and
you
have
also
this
other
term
.
now
one
of
these
will
go
to
zero
.
medal
.
which
one
of
these
is
going
to
be
zero
?
>
>
tom
tom
.
>
>
why
is
this
one
going
to
be
zero
?
that
's
always
my
second
question
.
first
part
is
50/50
.
might
be
lucky
.
who
recognizes
this
part
?
trevor
?

well
,
we
just
went
over
that
the
body
integral
of
the
radius

the-

's

it
's
not
radius
.
let
me
correct
quickly
.
that
's
the
position
vector
.
>

position
vector
,
yeah
,
that
's
[
inaudible
]
.

take

exactly
without
the
dot
this
is
nothing
but
the
center
of
mass
definition
.
we
rewrote
that
instead
of
the
mass
average
location
also
saying
that
if
all
locations
are
relative
to
the
center
of
mass
those
summing
ups
have
to
give
you
zero
.
so
integral
of
little
r
times
dn
is
zero
.
so
therefore
,
the
derivative
of
zero
is
still
going
to
be
zero
.
so
this
one
,
the
center
of
mass
location
.
this
is
,
basically
,
using
the
center
of
mass
definition
.
that
one
will
go
to
zero
leaving
us
with
this
term
and
this
term
.
now
this
term
is
nothing
but
total
mass
again
.
so
i
have
a
big
m.
so
mass
over
2
velocity
squared
,
so
you
can
see
for
the
blob
,
the
center
of
mass
acts
like
a
particle
again
,
which
is
really
nice
.
and
if
you
're
doing
an
orbit
problem
,
this
would
be
your
orbital
energy
of
your
spacecraft
basically
.
and
then
the
second
part
is
this
integral
,
body
integral
of
r
dot
,
so
that
's
the
position
vector
,
of
each
dm
relative
to
the
center
of
mass
.
get
its
inertial
derivative
though
.
that
's
important
.
this
is
a
dot
.
this
is
not
a
body
frame
derivative
.
that
's
the
inertial
derivative
and
we
sum
them
up
.
so
this
is
basically
your
kinetic
energy
about
the
center
of
mass
.
and
in
this
form
it
contains
two
parts
.
one
part
of
kinetic
energy
comes
from
rotation
.
if
all
the
stuff
is
rotating
then
these
things
could
be
spinning
,
and
that
gives
you
all
that
kind
of
kinetic
energy
.
the
other
part
is
because
this
is
blobs
,
you
might
have
deformational
energy
,
where
things
are
changing
shape
as
well
and
you
're
redistributing
mass
.
i
'm
not
gaining
or
losing
mass
in
this
system
,
but
i
'm
just
redistributing
.
so
if
you
had
fuel
slosh
bouncing
around
,
that
's
one
example
you
know
.
so
you
might
have
deformational
energy
happening
here
.
so
that
's
what
that
is
,
but
this
is
the
kinetic
energy
of
a
jello
,
written
in
the
very
form
,
basic
form
.
now
,
we
very
often
want
to
have
power
,
that
means
the
time
derivative
of
kinetic
energy
.
we
have
that
expression
,
broken
up
into
the
translational
part
of
the
cm
and
energy
about
the
cm
.
if
you
differentiate
this
,
you
come
up
with
these
here
.
let
me
show
you
that
one
trick
.
if
you
do
n't
see
that
,
how
to
go
from
there
.
if
you
have
a
vector
,
x
dotted
with
x.
if
i
have
a
scalar
x
squared
and
then
i
take
a
time
derivative
of
the
scalar
i
will
simply
have
2
times
x
times
x
dot
,
right
?
very
simple
.
here
,
if
you
have
this
vectorial
quantities
i
mean
these
expressions
we
see
a
lot
of
vectors
dotted
with
vectors
again
,
especially
themselves
.
if
you
have
this
and
you
take
a
time
derivative
and
here
,
i
'm
going
to
take
an
inertial
time
derivative
,
so
i
can
just
put
dots
over
my
vectors
.
with
the
chain
rule
,
you
would
have
x
dot
,
dotted
with
x
,
plus
x
dotted
with
x
dot
,
right
?
why
is
this
the
same
as
2
times
x
dotted
with
x
dot
?
why
can
i
simply
add
these
two
things
up
?
>
>
[
inaudible
]
reverse
the
order
.
>
>
right
.
the
answer
here
,
the
dot
part
is
actually
a
scalar
.
so
if
you
do
this
in
vector
form
a
dotted
with
b
is
the
same
thing
as
b
dotted
with
a.
if
you
're
doing
it
in
matrix
form
this
would
have
been
written
as
a
trans
x
transpose
x.
right
?
it
's
equivalent
.
and
in
that
case
too
,
the
answer
is
a
scalar
.
so
any
scalar
you
can
transpose
and
it
's
the
same
scalar
.
so
it
allows
you
to
reverse
the
matrix
order
with
the
right
transposes
on
it
.
this
is
nothing
but
the
vector
form
of
it
.
so
here
,
here
we
just
end
up
with
2
times
x
times
x
dot
,
or
you
could
've
rewritten
this
by
putting
the
dot
on
the
first
one
.
whatever
's
more
convenient
in
your
analytical
development
.
so
practice
that
if
you
have
n't
.
that
's
how
i
go
from
r
dot
r
dot
.
the
one
half
cancels
with
the
two
.
same
thing
here
.
little
r
dots
there
's
a
one
half
in
front
of
it
that
cancels
with
the
two
that
comes
out
of
the
differentiation
.
this
is
what
you
end
up
with
.
now
we
're
going
to
apply
some
stuff
.
we
know
from
the
super
particle
theorem
that
the
mass
time
initial
acceleration
of
the
center
of
mass
is
equal
to
the
net
external
force
.
so
that
's
good
.
so
we
can
plug
in
this
becomes
nothing
but
f.
over
here
little
r
dot
we
have
to
do
a
little
more
math
.
we
knew
that
big
r
is
rc
plus
little
r
,
so
you
just
put
two
dots
over
everything
.
now
we
have
the
inertial
derivatives
of
all
these
quantities
,
and
i
can
plug
that
one
in
.
so
that
will
break
up
this
integral
as
being
rc
double
dot
,
dotted
with
r
dot
.
and
,
sorry
,
there
's
an
r
double
dot
and
a
rc
double
dot
that
plugs
in
.
you
break
up
the
math
,
this
is
the
form
that
you
're
going
to
have
.
so
this
part
is
actually
pretty
much
done
.
so
the
power
equation
gives
you
force
dotted
with
velocity
.
the
shift
makes
sense
,
hopefully
with
high
school
physics
,
if
you
look
at
power
stuff
.
that
's
typically
always
the
force
times
a
velocity
measure
.
that
's
the
instantaneous
power
being
produced
mechanically
.
these
other
parts
,
we
're
going
to
have
to
look
at
.
now
here
,
anybody
see
a
term
that
's
going
to
go
to
zero
?
>
>
how
about
the
one
at
the
end
?
>
>
yep
,
this
one
again
,
right
?
due
to
the
center
of
mass
property
.
these
things
will
pop
up
everywhere
and
we
love
that
,
because
zero
is
great
.
it
really
simplifies
the
stuff
.
so
we
're
going
to
see
that
one
go
to
zero
and
this
is
nothing
but
mass
times
the
initial
acceleration
of
an
infinitesimal
element
that
was
nothing
but
df
,
that
little
force
.
so
on
the
body
,
this
is
your
general
power
expression
that
you
would
have
to
do
and
you
can
write
,
if
you
have
to
energy
change
between
two
points
,
you
would
integrate
these
equations
over
time
.
and
this
is
one
form
or
you
can
do
a
substitution
of
variables
.
this
is
a
classic
thing
you
've
probably
seen
where
you
can
also
do
it
force
times
distance
gives
you
the
energy
take
put
into
this
system
.
so
,
you
can
replace
it
.
there
's
different
forms
you
can
write
this
.
this
is
the
general
one
.
what
we
'll
use
in
class
will
be
the
rigid
body
specific
one
,
but
i
just
wanted
to
highlight
first
the
general
formulation
.
we
're
going
to
then
write
it
later
on
.
because
this
one
does
n't
make
much
sense
practically
for
you
right
now
.
once
you
make
it
rigid
,
we
'll
have
a
turn
that
would
be
very
very
clear
.
this
is
how
we
compute
this
.
