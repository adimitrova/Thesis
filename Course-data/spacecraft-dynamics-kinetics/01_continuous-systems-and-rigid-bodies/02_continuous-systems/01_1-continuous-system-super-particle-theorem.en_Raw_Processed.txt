continuous system, basically jello, 
blobs jello, right 
this is kind 
starting 
so we a dynamical system, thats this 
every selfrespecting dynamics 
class to 
amorphous flying potatoes right 
a general thing we want to 
compute certain properties 
newtons law is simply f ma, 
written in this form 
you see 
now, i a continuum, 
kind hard to full thing, 
a blob jello, right 
different things will 
different forces acting 
so we want to is track 
infinitesimal little elements here, 
thats little box thats 
dm infinitesimal object 
like classic calculus that youve 
seen many many times hopefully 
so df is force thats acting 
differential element, dm 
r is inertial position vector, so 
big r is inertial position vector 
little r is position vector relative 
to systems center mass 
so whatever this bulb is you 
an infinity little dms that add 
to this thing 
in common this instant 
thats center mass is so 
thats a classic location 
well writing equations 
that point so thats 
thats basically f ma times that 
so f ma important 
that we an inertia derivative so 
dots derivatives 
seen inertial frame, 
you to write position 
relative to inertial origin 
thats you wouldnt little r double 
dot, you to big r double dot, 
relative to inertial frame df 
forces, 
we categorize generally 
theres external stuff internal stuff 
give an example an external 
force that might acting 
a spacecraft 
drag 
drag, right, atmospheric 
drag is one definitely 
gravity could an external 
force acting 
you could solar radiation pressure 
you may thrusters 
this is a man made object, 
maybe you way to control 
you to stuff 
thats external things, so 
examples internal forces 
acting this blob jello 
torquers 
actually, good question 
so magnet torquers actually objects 
that push external magnetic field 
i would see external inaudible 
influences acting elements 
element might inside craft, 
still pushing an external field 
so would an internal 
force that you might 
reactions 
reactions is a good example 
you 
fly disks that we put in, 
sometimes called flywheels 
reaction wheels 
control movement gyros that 
spinning objects inside spacecraft, 
motors attached that 
will spin spin 
that motor is taking wheel 
pushing space craft 
so a dynamical system basically 
means part jello is pushing 
part jello 
thats cause spinning 
this would an internal force 
system right 
if you a free body diagram 
reaction wheel maybe we treat 
an external one that system 
here we space craft jello 
could fuel this stuff 
fuels another one 
fuel slash backing back forth 
internal forces 
that will key well 
talking internal forces, 
external forces, 
things impact momentum energy 
there good high level things 
that really useful a spacecraft 
analysts 
so going to break 
in two ways 
if i need a total 
force acting jello, 
i gazillion dms, 
i to integrate 
so if you look chapter we 
a summation we a gazillion 

if you a continuum you 
simply replace summation 
an integral sign 
thats really, if you go back look 
calculus you integrals, 
you kind broke 
little bitty chunks 
made chunks 
infinitesimally small 
basically this big summation 
so if youre summing this, 
claim here is total force 
acting this blob is sum 
forces acting individual dms 
is simply going to 
sum external forces 
happens to internal forces 
blots it, cancels 
yeah, law is that 
newtons third law 
yeah, one newtons laws, right 
so if you take a wall, push 
wall, wall is actually going to 
push back you exactly 
amount in opposite directions 
so im torquing a spacecraft, 
applying forces to wheel, 
youre getting equal 
opposite forces applied to spacecraft 
you sum 
things to mutually cancel 
so internal forces never contribute 
to a net force system, 
external ones that 
so im sure youve seen that 
basic properties jello is 
continuum, dynamical system is 
whatever mass distribution is, 
will a center mass location 
theres many ways to define 
im going to show you 
least two here 
one is center mass is 
essentially mass averaged location 
so rc is center mass this blob 
if you look r times dm 
you really, you think you got 
one kilogram, half a meter 
two kilograms, a full meter 
five kilograms, 
a half a meter to left, right 
you would add 
a distances divide a total mass 
thats going to 
center mass location, 
if you this mass 
distribution a system 
if continuum, instead 
summing you integrals mass, 
you know, 
mass object times location 
we divide 
total mass to get rc 
so thats a classic 
definition center mass, 
this works 
continuum dynamical system 
we break this 
vectors, inertial position vector 
so we say r here 
to rc pass r 
again, this is done in 
a purely vectorial way 
im saying r to expressed in 
body frame in inertial frame 
thats a book keeping 
element we keep to later 
right adding vectors 
vectors plus vectors that 
so if you this you see 
this will actually break 
lets that one quickly here 
we that 
rc r 
dm thats sum two vectors 
so im going to this, say okay 
thats going to rc dm rdm 
little subscript b that notation 
is actually a triple integral 
i to integrate entire body 
instead writing triple integrals 
limits, this is a short kind 
i one integral b that mean 
understood to integrating 
an entire, whenever this body is, 
right 
so we break things 
thats nice 
that a vector 
theres simplifications 
that going to happen 
we knew earlier, definition, 
this m times rc right 
this term somebody say 
this is going to refined 
right 
kevin 
youll get rc interval 
okay 
we get big m times r 
yeah this is nothing sum 
mass elements is total mass 
you get there 
so kevin you explain 
to okay to take 
rc varies time everything 
is okay to take 
outside integral 

intergrating phase 
right 
integrating body 
so you see b integrals, 
think that, this body, 
lets say center mass right 
here microphone easy right 
stop im looking this 
going this instant, 
whatever mass distribution is, 
left hand is part system 
center mass left hand is 
still here, right, system 
that rc location 
right hand is also going to here 
every element body, 
a continuum, 
shares 
center mass location 
so far body integral goes, 
a constant 
like integral times x 
you pick outside integral 
integral x right 
continue, thats we treat 
so this is a spatial integral 
yes rt varies time 
a spatial integration 
body volume right 
that location is a fixed doesnt 
change depending if youre looking 
nose spacecraft 
tail spacecraft 
one system that system 
one center mass location 
so yes thats reason, 
well use this trick several times today 
so if didnt quite make sense 
hopefully will sink in 
so you this 
that gives mrc plus 
little rdm mrc 
cancel 
you will little r times dm 
this is way 
if you classic sophomore 
level center mass stuff, 
you kilograms here, 
kilograms there, you add 
if positions taken 
relative to center mass 
mass times positions 
to sum to 
that means youve balanced perfectly 
thats looks like 
generally speaking 
we little r dms body 
integrals to equal to 
thats a complete d version 
that works jello 
so good 
so that, here, 
a few steps you prove this 
kind things 
i would definitely expect you to able 
to easily quickly in an exam 
so if you havent done much this, 
practice 
now, going to next is 
going to differentiate this 
so going to take that 
definition that we had, 
center mass location, 
this is good, 
im going to take two 
inertial time derivatives 
so that means left hand side, 
mass is constant 
im losing 
gaining mass in this dynamical system 
rc, i to put two 
dots im done 
this is kind like homework 
that you guys that inertial 
derivatives stuff 
in vectorial form this is dead simple, 
two dots youre done 
right hand side dm i guess 
doesnt change, losing 
gaining mass system 
this is a body integral, 
kevin saying 
so thing that varies is r 
so we get big r 
two dots 
you go back look newtons 
equation that mass times inertial 
acceleration is force 
acting that one 
so 
this replaced also force 
integral df force 
we show that integral df force 
is nothing net external force 
you ignore internal forces 
so you end an equation that 
look pretty darn familiar 
mass acceleration equal to force 
youve used primarily 
im assuming particles 
this is particle, heres mass, 
heres force this is 
going to go 
this actually also works a continuum 
blobs in space 
anybody seen muppet show 
there pigs in space, you know, 
a lot jiggling going 
thats that kind stuff 
this works anything, even muppets 
okay, so this is key thing 
we call this superparticle theorem 
this basically says, 
matter dynamical system is, 
this complete closed system, 
you treat center mass that 
system will act like a particle 
if i know there is two forces 
acting a megatometer 
maybe atmospheric drag force 
that daniel talking about, thats 
two forces i 
to consider acting center mass 
i will predict 
translational motion perfectly 
that blob may pull apart 
may kinds weird stuff 
so if external force depends 
shape, gets complicated 
so if this blob would pulling apart, 
gravity gradients parts 
closer to planets would 
different force parts top 
net forces change 
shape 
that makes complicated 
we didnt gravity 
we net thrusters 
youve got blobs in space 
somebody fires a thruster 
this thing is going to take 
go 
looking force 
knowing mass, i predict whats 
going to happen to center mass 
i dont know happens 
to shape yet, 
i know happens to 
center mass that system 
is a powerful argument 
so thats whats called 
super particle theorem 
blob in space 
if you concerned 
center mass, 
center mass will 
act like a particular 
f ma holds 
f to net external force 
m is total mass rc double dots 
to inertial second time derivative
