1
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,050
Okay, let's do a brief review.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,750
There's a lot of little math steps,
that we went through last time.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,630
These are definitely steps I feel,

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,988
you should be able to do from scratch,
basic principle.

5
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:20,130
And we're going to cover some
nuances that we go through.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,630
So.

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:27,960
[INAUDIBLE] no actually,
it's going to go here, that'll work.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,090
So one of the first things we were
looking at is, we've got a blob dn.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,680
This blob has a center of mass,
and we have some inertial frame.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,920
This is the center of
mass position vector.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,560
This little dn element has
a little r vector, and

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,150
then capital R is to find us
the inertial position of that element.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,290
I think it solved it.

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,400
That's kind of where we started out from.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,590
So let's see.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,199
Cody, what is the Super Particle Theorem?

17
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,165
>> Not quite sure.

18
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:11,380
[INAUDIBLE] last night.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,002
>> When it's fresh?

20
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:14,990
>> [LAUGH]
>> But yeah,

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,999
I watched the video late last night,
and it wasn't.

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,160
>> You slept through the video
last night you're saying?

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,680
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.
>> I see, okay.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Good, what is the super particle, Andre?

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Super particle theorem?

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,790
>> I couldn't tell you.

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,840
>> Did you watch the video?

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,435
>> It's just been a long week.

29
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:36,370
>> Okay, Super Particle Theorem?

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,211
>> The acceleration of the body
becomes on the external forces

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,266
>> Right, so actually close.

32
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,205
What did you mean by
acceleration of the body?

33
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:50,743
[NOISE] we have to be

34
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,983
more specific.

35
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:56,600
All right, this is a continuum.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,260
This could be your fuel slashing in space,
a jello.

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,720
You know astronauts eat jello in space,

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,130
so there's jello wobbling through
the space station I'm sure somewhere.

39
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,290
How does this stuff?

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,290
What's the dynamics of these things?

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,555
So when you say the acceleration of jello,
which part of the jello?

42
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,737
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Hmm?

43
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:15,200
>> Every part of the jello.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,700
>> No.

45
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,850
Can't be right, right?

46
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,340
because jello may have left side is
perfectly steady, the other side is

47
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,420
wobbling, two seconds later
it will all shift and change.

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,770
So you can't have every part of
the jello having the same acceleration.

49
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,840
Even if it's rigid, does this pen have
the same acceleration everywhere?

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,780
No, right?

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,640
So right away that statement,
you're on the right track.

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,240
What was it Brett, right?

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,140
>> It's the center of mass.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
>> It's the center of mass.

55
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,900
So the Super Particle Theorem says,
that the total mass of this system

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,930
times Rc double dot = F.

57
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,040
Now David, what goes into this F?

58
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,678
>> It's basically an integral
over all the particles,

59
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:09,374
the sum of the forces over all
the particles in the body.

60
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,930
>> Yeah.

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,710
Robert, can you be more specific?

62
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,300
This is true.

63
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,940
But it's not, there's more to this.

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,030
There's some refinements that we can do.

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,980
Which forces do we have to really
consider when we do this integration?

66
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,660
>> External forces?

67
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,240
>> External.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,630
What happens to the internal forces?

69
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,130
Russell?

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,938
When you sum up over the body,
what happens to internal forces?

71
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:38,444
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Sorry.

72
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,530
>> They cancel each other.

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,100
>> They cancel each other, exactly.

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,770
Right.

75
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,720
So this bolt has a force of one newton,
because another plate is pushing on it.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,950
But vice versa, the plate is having
a minus one Newton force somewhere.

77
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,596
And these things will
all sum up to be zero.

78
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:53,984
So internal force is completely banished.

79
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:01,203
Only the external forces, so this is
really dF external that's kind of what

80
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:07,240
you can think of this,
integrated over the whole body.

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,610
This is what we derived last time.

82
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,150
And basically it's a very powerful thing.

83
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,610
We'll be using it one of the examples,

84
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,800
you'll be using it in
the current homeworks as well.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,410
So without knowing what's going on with
fuel slosh and all the other stuff.

86
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,292
If you just know the external
influences on your space craft,

87
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,230
regardless of what flexing is
going on inside in deformations,

88
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,620
especially if it's rigid as well.

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,270
Of course, you can predict what
the center of mass must be doing.

90
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,850
And the center of mass motion for
spacecraft,

91
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,250
that's basically your translation,
your orbit's problem.

92
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,069
So we can account for all of that.

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,990
Now there's ways that attitude
couples into this total force.

94
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,850
Can you think of an example where, you
need to keep track of what the shape is

95
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,080
and the orientation of an object,
to figure out what the external force is?

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,730
Daniel?

97
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,490
>> Drag.

98
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,170
>> Drag, atmospheric drag right?

99
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,350
So there are particular
types of disturbances,

100
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,520
acting on a space craft that
depend on the orientation.

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,610
And if it's this shape in space, or
this shape in space as we'll see in a few

102
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,960
weeks, gravity gradients
make a big difference right?

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,920
So there are external influences
that do matter on the shape.

104
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,120
So those become harder obviously to track,

105
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,890
because now you have
to track orientations,

106
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,460
your codes immediately slow way down,
because for attitude you have to have much

107
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,720
smaller time steps than orbits typically,
and so lots and lots of challenges.

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,430
But this is it.

109
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,410
This is the Super Particle Theorem.

110
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,230
Now we had the center of mass definition,
MRc equal to this.

111
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,420
This was one of them, right.

112
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,460
Basically, the center of mass of
a blob is the mass averaged location,

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,380
that's one way to look at it.

114
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,220
Instead of an integral,
putting in a summation sign,

115
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,660
it looks just like your classic
statics book that you had.

116
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,310
Mass averaged location.

117
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,782
What was the other definition
that we used over and over again,

118
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,627
for center of mass of a property?

119
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,540
Thibault, do you remember?

120
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,680
>> The weighted average of
the positions with the r plus small r.

121
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,500
That's a good answer.

122
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,950
>> Yeah there we go.

123
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,780
So this is the average position
relative to the center of mass,

124
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,990
have to add up to zero.

125
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,590
Then basically it's
the balance point right?

126
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,430
You put that little lever right
there in the center of mass, and

127
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,970
you'll be able to balance something.

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,010
I can't I'm not quite good
enough this morning all right.

129
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,450
But it's something like that.

130
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,578
It's not my pen, I don't care.

131
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:28,810
>> [LAUGH]
>> No of course I care.

132
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,840
So these are center of mass definitions.

133
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,520
And then we said,

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,890
we can take two derivatives,
put the dots in here all right.

135
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,053
This was one thing we did
on the left hand side,

136
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,673
if you take two inertial
derivatives you just get this.

137
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:47,804
Then we have the second derivative
of this integral Rdm right?

138
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:53,290
And from here we ended
up with this expression.

139
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,400
Bret right,
it was you that brought up that question.

140
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,179
That was an excellent question.

141
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,900
Why can we take these derivatives
inside this interval,

142
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,310
because the body if it's jello,
the boundary actually varies with time.

143
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,300
If B is defined to be this
boundary of the actual jello.

144
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,638
So in the textbook we have,

145
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:16,610
there's actually a statement early in that
paragraph on that section saying hey,

146
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,580
when you do these body integrals or
these integrals over B,

147
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,640
the domain has to be carefully
selected to encompass all the mass.

148
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,040
Basically what it means is,
you create B in this case for

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,150
a continuum is not just
the body surface itself.

150
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,130
You can make a box bigger than that.

151
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,310
This isn't a fluids or continuum problem.

152
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,750
There's not a mass flow of air,
or some plasma, or

153
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,960
something coming with water,
coming through here.

154
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,240
It's a fixed shape.

155
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,630
And it's doing some stuff.

156
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,210
So you can define the bounds of these
integrations to be bigger, basically make

157
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,515
it big enough that no matter what
the worse case deflections are,

158
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,710
you've got a bounding box
that's big enough to cover it.

159
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,690
So when you're doing all
these integrals afterwords,

160
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,700
something times dm, out here
the dm is simply going to be zero.

161
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,120
If this stuff deforms and encompasses it,
all of the sudden dm becomes non zero.

162
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
That's a way to look around it.

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,870
This avoids Reynolds transport theorem or

164
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,930
lightness stuff, that otherwise
you'd have to use on the boundary.

165
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,330
But again, this is a fixed shape.

166
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,260
We're not adding,
losing mass to the system,

167
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,194
we're just looking at
deformations right now.

168
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:24,597
So there's a discussion ahead with
my co-author, John Jenkins and

169
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:27,824
I have to give credit also to
Johnny Hurtado, professor at A&M,

170
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,660
he writes a lot of analytical books.

171
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,350
He pointed me to some good references.

172
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,050
This type of derivative, we also call
sometimes the material time derivative, or

173
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,795
the co-moving time derivative.

174
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,480
because you're really
following each dm element.

175
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,780
And we're not creating new dms.

176
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,080
There's not a flow of dms like in
a fluid flow, that comes in and

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,590
out of the surface area.

178
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,970
On the boundary, as you change stuff
there's no mass flux coming in and

179
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,480
out of the boundary either.

180
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,930
So lots of different ways to look at it.

181
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,730
But the easiest explanation I think for
engineers is, just for

182
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,450
this kind of problems you've got a space
craft flexing, you're getting all these

183
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,550
equations of motions, the results I've
shown are classic and definitely true.

184
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,210
It's just this step there's
some subtleties there.

185
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,290
So Brett very good.

186
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,390
Gold star for
asking the right question from analytical-

187
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,610
>> That was Hansel actually.

188
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,960
>> Hansel?
I thought that was you.

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,990
Well gold star for honesty.

190
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,408
So Hansel, he's not here today.

191
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,080
>> [LAUGH]
>> Well somebody

192
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,630
right back there who asked
a great question, thank you.

193
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,010
But that was an issue
I wanted to bring up.

194
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,090
This is a subtlety, but this is an easy
way to look around that form continuum.

195
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,610
Once we turn rigid, all this stuff
is completely simple anyway.

196
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,360
Then all these results definitely hold.

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,530
But even for a continuum, the results
I showed you are absolutely true.

198
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,050
But if you do these derivations in these
books, there's lots of little subtleties.

199
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,170
And moving a derivative inside
this differential operator,

200
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,860
is something you always
have to do carefully.

201
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,450
So I didn't have a good answer last time,
but I do have a better answer now.

202
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,550
So we did derive this.

203
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,420
And this gave us in the end,
this was the dFs and this was nothing but

204
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,860
a Super Particle Theorem.

205
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,630
Good, so we derive that.

206
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,010
Now, let's review quickly
angular momentum.

207
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,848
Brian, of a blob, what do you
remember about angular momentum?

208
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:10,986
>> It's.

209
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:11,701
>> When?

210
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,507
>> When there is no external torques.

211
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:21,910
>> So, if you're saying if
L is zero then H dot = 0.

212
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,570
So, it's a vectorial quantity.

213
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,990
Right.
This becomes important.

214
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,850
So when you say it's preserved,

215
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,780
we're saying the inertial derivative
of this vectorial quantity is zero.

216
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,609
So it's a constant as seen
by an inertial observer.

217
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,370
As we go through equations of motion
today, you will see the angle momentum

218
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,970
expression, as seen by the body fixed
observer, is actually not constant.

219
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,710
So the body relative
derivative is not zero.

220
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,550
But the inertial derivative is zero.

221
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,390
Which is a really good integration check,
when you write in code.

222
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,670
Every time stamp,
recompute the derivative.

223
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,710
All outside the derivative.

224
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,767
Compute h.
And then map h,

225
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,132
because you're typically
computing the body frame,

226
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:03,140
map everything into the end frame.

227
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,160
And those three end frame components,
should be nice flat lines.

228
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,460
Then you get warm fuzzy feelings
that you're doing the right thing.

229
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,740
Now when is this true?

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,630
When is h dot equal to L?

231
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,740
CK.
Is that always the case?

232
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,040
>> It's not accelerating?

233
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:26,180
Center of mass is not accelerating.

234
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,930
>> No.

235
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,416
Center of mass can be accelerating.

236
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,130
You're on the right track, but
you're talking about the wrong point.

237
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,520
When we have moments and torques,
we need to specify something.

238
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,140
Robert?

239
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,420
>> When the about the center of mass?

240
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,459
>> That was one option.

241
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,590
When we derived this H dot, we found it
was H dot equal to L, plus something.

242
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,840
And that something had an RP minus RC.

243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,860
So if the point, about which
we're taking moments in torques,

244
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,280
is the center of mass then
that second part went to zero.

245
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,930
The other one is related to
what CK is talking about.

246
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,200
There was something about being inertial.

247
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,170
But it's not the center of mass being
inertial, but it's really rp double log.

248
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,520
So if the point about which you're
taking moments is an inertial point,

249
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,890
it could be stationary.

250
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,660
That's cool.

251
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,650
Or it could be moving at a constant speed,
also has zero acceleration,

252
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,050
then this equation holds.

253
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,300
So that's an important thing, today you
will see when we get through equations

254
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,190
of motion, especially a slender rod,

255
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,690
in homework you're doing one
that's tipping off a point and

256
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,190
has some friction, we'll do one,
there's no friction slides in place.

257
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,110
But here we'll be using
Super Particle Theorem, H dot = L,

258
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,000
and when we use H dot = L we have to make
sure we do it about the center of mass of

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,186
the dynamical system, or
about an inertially fixed point.

260
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:46,070
And then this will work right?

261
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,650
So good.

262
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,360
Those were two important
subtleties that we needed.

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,288
But this is about H dot.

264
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,990
Let's step back and talk about H itself.

265
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,610
Can somebody tell me something about H?

266
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,940
For a blob of jello.

267
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:07,766
Right the fundamental definition is,
this integral over a domain B.

268
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:15,420
You have position crossed with
linear momentum of that one right?

269
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,344
Is this the form we typically use then?

270
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:21,860
Evan?

271
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,850
>> No we usually use the sigma form, which
defines that difference between r and rp.

272
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,310
>> Right we can make that one general.

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,920
There's something else though.

274
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,180
We can break this angular momentum,

275
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,570
same thing with kinetic energy,
with these blobs.

276
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,330
There's a way that we can actually
separate into two different chunks.

277
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,280
Do you remember, Evan?

278
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,670
>> I'd have to look to tell you but
I think we-

279
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,600
>> Just in words.

280
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,350
In words what then we can see?

281
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,080
>> We can separate it
into two integrals of

282
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,650
the positions crossed, and
then position of acceleration?

283
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,530
>> Lucas, help him out.

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,810
>> I'd have to look at my notes.

285
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,190
>> Matt?

286
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,318
>> So we're going to define R in terms
of little r and R of the center of mass,

287
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:15,085
and then [INAUDIBLE] integrals and
one of them cancels to zero?

288
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,440
>> Yep some stuff definitely equals
to zero, we're left with two parts,

289
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,850
you guys are on the right track.

290
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,585
But what are those two, angular momentum?

291
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,212
Shayla, do you remember?

292
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:28,067
>> [INAUDIBLE]
is equal to [INAUDIBLE]

293
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,240
across R.

294
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,870
So you sub that in.

295
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,135
>> When is this one true?

296
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:36,440
>> [INAUDIBLE]?

297
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,940
>> Yes?

298
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,410
Is this true for a blob?

299
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:48,456
Maurice?

300
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,616
I'm full of good questions every morning.

301
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:55,770
>> [LAUGH]
>> This should not be a surprise,

302
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,260
this many weeks into the semester.

303
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,628
Who knew he was going to ask me
questions about last lecture?

304
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:00,364
>> [LAUGH]
>> I know.

305
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,070
[INAUDIBLE] couldn't foresee this at all.

306
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,170
>> When is this true, people?

307
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,650
>> For a rigid body.

308
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,720
>> Rigid body.

309
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,950
It's only true for a rigid body, that's
in fact [INAUDIBLE] go to rigid bodies.

310
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,220
But we're already answering
questions about that, right.

311
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,821
People sometimes quickly assume
to look at this stuff and

312
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,784
direct to deriving of the exam.

313
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,311
R dot rigid, R dot must be zero.

314
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:22,500
No.

315
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,610
Each little particle is going to have
some inertial derivative of this vector.

316
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,450
It's not growing, it's not shrinking,
because it's rigid.

317
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,280
But it is non-zero because it's tumbling.

318
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,990
So this part is only true if it's rigid.

319
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,260
Let me make that not next to it.

320
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,760
If rigid.

321
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:44,053
But, as Matt was saying,
we do make this thing, you plug it in,

322
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,770
you do all the stuff.

323
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,580
Okay.

324
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,420
Somebody, somebody here surely
remembers how we break this up.

325
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,978
What are the two chunks?

326
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,474
>> That minus.

327
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:58,552
>> Yeah, what is that part?

328
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,947
>> There is the cross product.

329
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:08,070
>> No, not dm.

330
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,867
Okay.

331
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:18,650
So this is the second part.

332
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,431
But again, if you get into this form
[INAUDIBLE], what have you assumed?

333
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,644
[SOUND] Okay, so I'm hearing a lot of
sub-results that are true for rigid.

334
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,330
Let's go to a blob.

335
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,160
H is equal to R crossed, R dot dm.

336
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,520
You can rewrite this.

337
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:56,110
Where essentially Rc, why is that?

338
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,663
Okay.

339
00:16:56,663 --> 00:17:00,719
Crossed MRc dot plus

340
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:06,450
integral of little r dot DM.

341
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,220
Why is this form convenient?

342
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,520
What is the first part then?

343
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:14,984
Andrew?

344
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:20,210
>> [INAUDIBLE] the angular momentum of
the center of mass about some point.

345
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,023
>> Right, so
this is about the inertial point or

346
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,656
something that we've picked, right.

347
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,100
There are moments about that.

348
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,110
R is defined relative, it's the Rc not R.

349
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,820
Right.
So it's important with these problems, and

350
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,260
you start from the fundamentals.

351
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,140
You're always going to get this,
well this is a blob,

352
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,340
I have all my position
vectors [INAUDIBLE] inertial.

353
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,250
We break it up like Matt explained,
relative to center,

354
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,880
the motion of the center mass plus
motion relative to the center of mass.

355
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,100
Momentum, you want to write
exactly the same way.

356
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,390
Why is that convenient?

357
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,540
This in essence,
gives you the translational side.

358
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,980
That's the orbit problem when
[INAUDIBLE] flying through space, right?

359
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,730
So, you can separate moment to orbital,
a momentum is essentially this part.

360
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,950
This part contains what type of motion?

361
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,410
Griffin.

362
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,420
>> Attitude.

363
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,250
>> Attitude motion, and what else?

364
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,220
This is blob still.

365
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:14,972
>> Deformation.

366
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:16,160
Deformations, right.

367
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,260
>> So shape changes,
fuel sloshing, flexing of panels,

368
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,210
all this kind of stuff would
also be accounted in this.

369
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,100
So this is the anglular momentum
about the center of mass.

370
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,960
And this is the angular
momentum of the center of mass.

371
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,040
That's the important
distinction we keep making.

372
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,810
So in this class we derive it,
we get these terms but

373
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,010
now we're going to focus on this part.

374
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
And if you go look at the kinetic energy,

375
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,640
we can write that in
very much the same way.

376
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,170
We derive that, similar properties
that we used, the center of mass

377
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,925
properties terms drop out, but
you end up getting the kinetic energy of

378
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:57,160
the center of mass plus the kinetic energy
about the center of mass, all right?

379
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,480
So this is the classic thing we can
keep doing, over and over again.
