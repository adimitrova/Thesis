1
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:07,380
Let us do some more fun.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,780
Kinetic energies for
particles, you guys know that.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,980
That's mass over two times
velocity squared essentially,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,430
that's what you've had.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,550
This is the vectorial form of that.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,680
I have dm, so
instead of mass I just have dm over two.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,390
That's essentially what that does.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,000
Times my inertial speed squared.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,810
I'm doing this in a vectorial way,
so R dot is my, you

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,630
know if R is my inertial position vector,
I need to have my inertial velocity.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,000
That's the first inertial time
derivative of R, that's an R dot.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm dotting it with itself,

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,740
that's going to give me my inertial
velocity magnitude squared.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,480
It's just a vectorial way to write it, but
it's a very general way to write this.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
So that's it.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,070
Now that's for one dm,
I need it for the whole blob.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,350
You simply integrate again over the body.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,100
That's where the integral comes in.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,220
It's just summing them all up.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,560
So good, now we have kinetic energy.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,700
That's not the most convenient form.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,260
We don't typically write it this
way because it's kind of hard.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,900
We would like to break it up in terms of
rc and kinetic energy off the center of

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,920
mass and then we're looking at kinetic
energy about the center of mass and

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,230
that will help us separate rotational
stuff, deformational stuff and

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,220
translational stuff.

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,480
That's what you'll see
popping out of this.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,260
So let's do this.

29
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:23,820
R dot.

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,060
R was defined as Rc + r, so R dot,
you just put dots everywhere.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,520
Again, vectorial form, dead simple, right.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,670
The 3.6 comes back.

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,491
Don't do part b any more.

34
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,920
Do part a where we only take time
derivatives and vectorial parts.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,300
You plug this in and
you carry out the various dot products.

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,480
You guys know how to do basic
dot products in calculus.

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm not going to do that again.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,000
So we end up with these terms.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,210
And, as Kevin was saying earlier, in these
body intervals, anything that's RC and

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,130
RC dot, those are all going to be things
that are fixed over the body interval.

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,260
Because every point in that blob
has the same center of mass.

42
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,750
Therefore, it has the same
center of mass velocity.

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,140
So we can always treat these quantities
as constants over the integration.

44
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,690
So when you carry, you know,
this is a step I'm not doing here,

45
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,685
I'm purposely not, because I want you
guys to, you should do this yourself.

46
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:18,620
[COUGH] Run through the notes,
that's how it's going to stick.

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,630
If we do that, these can be pulled out.

48
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,310
Same thing gets pulled out here.

49
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,920
And at the end there's a factor of
two with the half that cancels, and

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,179
you have also this other term.

51
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,810
Now one of these will go to zero.

52
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,310
Medal.

53
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,103
Which one of these is going to be zero?

54
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,690
>> Tom Tom.

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,821
>> Why is this one going to be zero?

56
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,130
That's always my second question.

57
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,589
First part is 50/50.

58
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:53,813
Might be lucky.

59
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,206
Who recognizes this part?

60
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:58,260
Trevor?

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,710
>> Well, we just went over that the body

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,850
integral of the radius times the-
>> That's the vector.

63
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,540
It's not radius.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,560
Let me correct quickly.

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,580
That's the position vector.

66
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,950
>> Position vector, yeah,
that's [INAUDIBLE].

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,945
>> Radius would be a scalar.

68
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:16,663
>> [CROSSTALK] And so
that's equal to zero.

69
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,430
>> Yes.
>> Take

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,490
the derivative of that
that should still be zero.

71
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,890
>> Exactly without the dot this is nothing
but the center of mass definition.

72
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,680
We rewrote that instead of the mass
average location also saying that if

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,800
all locations are relative to the center
of mass those summing ups have to give

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,360
you zero.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,590
So integral of little r times dn is zero.

76
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,190
So therefore, the derivative of
zero is still going to be zero.

77
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,940
So this one, the center of mass location.

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,860
This is, basically,
using the center of mass definition.

79
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,540
That one will go to zero leaving
us with this term and this term.

80
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,890
Now this term is nothing but
total mass again.

81
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,110
So I have a big M.

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,450
So mass over 2 velocity squared,
so you can see for

83
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,030
the blob, the center of mass acts like
a particle again, which is really nice.

84
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,270
And if you're doing an orbit problem,

85
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,260
this would be your orbital energy
of your spacecraft basically.

86
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,520
And then the second part is this integral,
body integral of r dot, so

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,720
that's the position vector,
of each DM relative to the center of mass.

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,320
Get its inertial derivative though.

89
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,940
That's important.

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,450
This is a dot.

91
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,960
This is not a body frame derivative.

92
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,630
That's the inertial derivative and
we sum them up.

93
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,930
So this is basically your kinetic
energy about the center of mass.

94
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,200
And in this form it contains two parts.

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
One part of kinetic energy
comes from rotation.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,310
If all the stuff is rotating then
these things could be spinning, and

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,480
that gives you all that
kind of kinetic energy.

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,941
The other part is because this is blobs,
you might have deformational energy,

99
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:44,149
where things are changing shape as
well and you're redistributing mass.

100
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm not gaining or losing mass in this
system, but I'm just redistributing.

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,230
So if you had fuel slosh bouncing around,
that's one example you know.

102
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,020
So you might have deformational
energy happening here.

103
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,350
So that's what that is, but

104
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,510
this is the kinetic energy of a jello,
written in the very form, basic form.

105
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,880
Now, we very often want to have power,

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,080
that means the time
derivative of kinetic energy.

107
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,030
We have that expression, broken up into
the translational part of the cm and

108
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,860
energy about the cm.

109
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,630
If you differentiate this,
you come up with these here.

110
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,870
Let me show you that one trick.

111
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,535
If you don't see that,
how to go from there.

112
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:28,240
If you have a vector, x dotted with x.

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,940
If I have a scalar x squared and then
I take a time derivative of the scalar

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,005
I will simply have 2 times x times x dot,
right?

115
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,800
Very simple.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,240
Here, if you have this vectorial
quantities I mean these expressions

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,520
we see a lot of vectors dotted with
vectors again, especially themselves.

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,010
If you have this and you take a time
derivative and here, I'm going to

119
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,720
take an inertial time derivative, so
I can just put dots over my vectors.

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,120
With the chain rule, you would have x dot,

121
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,830
dotted with x,
plus x dotted with x dot, right?

122
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,632
Why is this the same as 2
times x dotted with x dot?

123
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,314
Why can I simply add these two things up?

124
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,770
>> [INAUDIBLE] Reverse the order.

125
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,360
>> Right.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,510
The answer here,
the dot part is actually a scalar.

127
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,610
So if you do this in vector form
a dotted with b is the same thing as b

128
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,220
dotted with a.

129
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,523
If you're doing it in matrix form this
would have been written as a trans x

130
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:33,600
transpose x.

131
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,230
Right?

132
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,470
It's equivalent.

133
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,590
And in that case too,
the answer is a scalar.

134
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,160
So any scalar you can transpose and
it's the same scalar.

135
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,440
So it allows you to reverse the matrix
order with the right transposes on it.

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,540
This is nothing but the vector form of it.

137
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,460
So here, here we just end up
with 2 times x times x dot, or

138
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,535
you could've rewritten this by
putting the dot on the first one.

139
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:57,520
Whatever's more convenient in
your analytical development.

140
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,970
So practice that if you haven't.

141
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,690
That's how I go from R dot R dot.

142
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,490
The one half cancels with the two.

143
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,230
Same thing here.

144
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,800
Little r dots there's a one half in front
of it that cancels with the two that

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,010
comes out of the differentiation.

146
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,560
This is what you end up with.

147
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,870
Now we're going to apply some stuff.

148
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,710
We know from the super particle
theorem that the mass time initial

149
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,440
acceleration of the center of mass
is equal to the net external force.

150
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,990
So that's good.

151
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,050
So we can plug in this becomes nothing but
f.

152
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,065
Over here little r dot we have
to do a little more math.

153
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:37,990
We knew that big R is Rc plus little r,
so you just put two dots over everything.

154
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,910
Now we have the inertial derivatives
of all these quantities, and

155
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,210
I can plug that one in.

156
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,310
So that will break up this integral as
being Rc double dot, dotted with R dot.

157
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,780
And, sorry, there's an R double dot and
a Rc double dot that plugs in.

158
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,800
You break up the math, this is
the form that you're going to have.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,880
So this part is actually pretty much done.

160
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,070
So the power equation gives you
force dotted with velocity.

161
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,080
The shift makes sense,
hopefully with high school physics,

162
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,470
if you look at power stuff.

163
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,580
That's typically always the force
times a velocity measure.

164
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,960
That's the instantaneous power
being produced mechanically.

165
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,470
These other parts,
we're going to have to look at.

166
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,019
Now here, anybody see a term
that's going to go to zero?

167
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,360
>> How about the one at the end?

168
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,580
>> Yep, this one again, right?

169
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,200
Due to the center of mass property.

170
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,710
These things will pop up everywhere and
we love that, because zero is great.

171
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,510
It really simplifies the stuff.

172
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,370
So we're going to see that one go
to zero and this is nothing but

173
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,630
mass times the initial acceleration of an
infinitesimal element that was nothing but

174
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,650
dF, that little force.

175
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,340
So on the body, this is your general power
expression that you would have to do and

176
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,380
you can write, if you have to
energy change between two points,

177
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,910
you would integrate these
equations over time.

178
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,000
And this is one form or
you can do a substitution of variables.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,640
This is a classic thing you've probably
seen where you can also do it force times

180
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,250
distance gives you the energy
take put into this system.

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,360
So, you can replace it.

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,670
There's different forms
you can write this.

183
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,830
This is the general one.

184
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,538
What we'll use in class will be
the rigid body specific one, but

185
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,410
I just wanted to highlight
first the general formulation.

186
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,840
We're going to then write it later on.

187
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,780
because this one doesn't make much
sense practically for you right now.

188
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,960
Once you make it rigid, we'll have
a turn that would be very very clear.

189
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
This is how we compute this.
