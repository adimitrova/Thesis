1
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:06,770
Okay.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,810
Linear momentum,
just kind of wrapping things up for

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,800
blobs, since we're onto blobs.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,380
The linear momentum is always mass times
velocity, is your linear momentum.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,730
Then a completely vectorial way in
a blob you would have your mass is DM,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,770
your velocity inertial is R dot,
and P is my linear momentum.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,830
So DP is my linear momentum of that
differential element that you have.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,190
If you want the total linear
momentum of a system,

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,200
you have to integrate over the body again,
and you just plug in all these things.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,350
Then same rules, we will plug in,

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,690
instead of R we have Rc + little r,
and we can break this up.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,460
We can pull this Rc out again.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,070
And this integral by now, hopefully
boring you can go yep, that's zero.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,300
Right, that's the center of mass property
again, and that one's going to vanish.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,290
This one we've replaced with total mass.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:53,840
So that's it.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,790
So for a blob, again,
like the super particle theorem, need to

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,890
know what is the total mass of the system
and how is the center of mass moving?

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,540
And then we know what's going on.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,790
If you differentiate it, this is how
you come up with Newton's equation for

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,630
a constant mass solution.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,670
So mass is preserved.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,870
We're not gaining and
losing mass in the system.

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,580
Taking the inertial derivative
of linear momentum and

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,710
you plug that into this equation,
this R dot becomes an R double dot.

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,370
This is nothing but the force acting on
that element but integrated over a body.

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,470
You only care about
the external forces again.

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,180
Which is a very powerful statement.

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,800
So if you go to space station
have flew away from earth and

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,890
she's going through deep space.

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,110
And astronauts in there all of a sudden
start running up on a treadmill.

32
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,150
Are they ever going to change the
center-of-mass motion of the spacecraft?

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,080
No.
They may change the orientation,

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,520
they may change the shape.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,900
But these internal forces can
never change your linear momentum.

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,510
That's what we saw in
the superparticle theorem, too,

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,989
that only external forces impact how
the center of mass evolves through space.

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,415
So, this is a kind of handy,
handy, formula.
