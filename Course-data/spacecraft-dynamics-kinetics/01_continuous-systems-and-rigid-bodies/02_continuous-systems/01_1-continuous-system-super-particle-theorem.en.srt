1
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:09,370
Continuous system, basically jello,
blobs of jello, right?

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,770
This is kind of what
we're starting out with.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,672
So we have a dynamical system, that's this
and our every self-respecting dynamics

4
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:20,200
class has to have these
amorphous flying potatoes right.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,970
It's just a general thing and we want to
now compute certain properties of it.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,240
Newton's Law is simply F = MA,
written in this form.

7
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:34,265
You can see.

8
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:38,055
And now, because I have a continuum, it's
kind of hard to do it for the full thing,

9
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,165
a blob of Jello, right?

10
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,102
Different things will have
different forces acting on it.

11
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:46,336
So what we want to do is track
infinitesimal little elements here, and

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,845
that's my little box that's
DM infinitesimal object.

13
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:54,375
Just like classic calculus that you've
seen many many times before hopefully.

14
00:00:54,375 --> 00:01:00,737
So df is the force that's acting
on the differential element, dm.

15
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:06,710
R is my inertial position vector, so
big R is the inertial position vector.

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,039
Little r is my position vector relative
to the system's center of mass.

17
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,557
So whatever this bulb is you have
an infinity of little DM's that all add up

18
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:17,307
to this thing.

19
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:21,038
They have in common at this instant
that's where the center of mass is so

20
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:22,610
that's a classic location.

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,946
We'll be writing all our equations
about that point so that's it.

22
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,884
That's basically F = MA times that.

23
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:32,547
So but for F = MA it was important
that we have an inertia derivative so

24
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,643
these dots are derivatives as
seen by the inertial frame,

25
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:39,800
and you have to write your position
relative to the inertial origin.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,861
That's why you wouldn't do little r double
dot, you have to do big R double dot,

27
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,912
relative to the inertial frame then dF.

28
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,280
Now these forces,
we can categorize them generally.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,620
There's external stuff and internal stuff.

30
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,641
Who can give me an example of an external
force that might be acting on

31
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,336
a spacecraft?

32
00:01:58,808 --> 00:01:59,370
>> Drag.

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,480
>> Drag, right, atmospheric
drag is one of them definitely.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,130
Gravity could be an external
force acting on it.

35
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,300
You could have solar radiation pressure.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,600
You may have your thrusters.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,890
This is a man made object,
maybe you have some way to control it.

38
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,480
Now you have to do some stuff.

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,794
That's all the external things, so

40
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,982
what are examples of internal forces
acting on this blob of jello?

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,811
>> Torquers?

42
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,930
>> Actually, good question.

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,023
So magnet torquers are actually objects
that push off the external magnetic field.

44
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:39,130
I would see them as external [INAUDIBLE]
influences acting on these elements.

45
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,175
The element might be inside the craft, but
it's still pushing off an external field.

46
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:47,020
So what would be an internal
force then that you might have?

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,990
>> Reactions.

48
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,800
>> Reactions is a good example.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,810
because you have these
fly disks that we put in,

50
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,190
sometimes called flywheels or
reaction wheels or

51
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,670
control movement gyros that are all
spinning objects inside our spacecraft,

52
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,390
and then they have motors attached that
will spin them up or spin them down.

53
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,780
That motor is taking the wheel and
it's pushing off the space craft.

54
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,380
So as a dynamical system it basically
means some part of jello is pushing

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,750
off the other part of the jello and
that's what cause the spinning.

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,354
This would be an internal force for
the system all right?

57
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:20,212
If you do a free body diagram of just the
reaction wheel then maybe we can treat it

58
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,920
as an external one on that system.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,101
But here we have space craft jello
could be fuel and all this stuff.

60
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,305
Fuel's another one.

61
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,105
Fuel slash backing back and forth.

62
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,135
Those are all internal forces.

63
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:35,085
And that will be key because we'll
be talking about internal forces,

64
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:38,530
external forces, and
how do things impact momentum and energy.

65
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,247
And there are some good high level things
that are really useful as a spacecraft

66
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:42,818
analysts.

67
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,350
So we're going to break
it off in two ways.

68
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,520
Now if I need a total
force acting on jello,

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,900
I have it gazillion dm's,
I have to integrate over them.

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,840
So if you look at chapter 2 we do
a summation because we have a gazillion

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,580
of them.

72
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,750
And if you have a continuum you
simply replace the summation

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,890
with an integral sign.

74
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,860
That's really, if you go back and look
at calculus and how you did integrals,

75
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,750
you kind of broke it up into
little bitty chunks and

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,260
then made those chunks
infinitesimally small.

77
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,865
It's basically this big summation.

78
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:14,117
So if you're summing up over this,
the claim here is the total force

79
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:18,909
acting on this blob is the sum of all
the forces acting on the individual DMs.

80
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,250
Which is simply going to be
the sum of the external forces.

81
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,904
What happens to the internal forces?

82
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,440
>> It blots it, it cancels out.

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,862
>> Yeah, which law is that?

84
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,646
>> Newton's third law.

85
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,650
>> Yeah, it's one of Newton's laws, right?

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,260
So if you take a wall, and push against
the wall, the wall is actually going to

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,330
push back with you exactly the same
amount but in opposite directions.

88
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,870
So as I'm torquing on a spacecraft,
applying forces to the wheel,

89
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,210
you're getting equal and
opposite forces applied to the spacecraft.

90
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,280
When you sum them up all those
things have to mutually cancel.

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,890
So internal forces never contribute
to a net force on the system,

92
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,950
only the external ones do that.

93
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,480
So I'm sure you've seen that before.

94
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,061
Now some basic properties of jello is
any continuum, any dynamical system is

95
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:10,584
whatever the mass distribution is,
it will have a center of mass location.

96
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,960
And there's many ways to define it.

97
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,150
I'm going to show you
it's at least two here.

98
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,959
One of them is the center of mass is
essentially your mass averaged location.

99
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,290
So Rc is the center of mass of this blob.

100
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,400
If you look at R times dm.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,370
You really, you think of it you got
one kilogram, half a meter out.

102
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,810
Two kilograms, a full meter out.

103
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,270
And five kilograms,
a half a meter to the left, right?

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,050
You would add them up with
a distances divide by a total mass.

105
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,156
That's going to be
the center of mass location,

106
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:43,320
if you have this mass
distribution on a system.

107
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,986
If it's continuum, instead of
summing you do integrals of mass,

108
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:51,750
you know,
the mass of the object times its location.

109
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,990
And then we divide by
the total mass to get Rc.

110
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,969
So that's a classic
definition of center of mass,

111
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,772
this works for
any continuum dynamical system.

112
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:06,400
Now we can break this up because these
are vectors, the inertial position vector.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,540
So we can say R here has
to be RC pass the r.

114
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,640
Again, this is done in
a purely vectorial way.

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,490
I'm not saying r has to be expressed in
the body frame or in the inertial frame.

116
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,220
That's a book keeping
element we keep to later.

117
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,690
Right now we're just adding vectors.

118
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,150
Vectors plus vectors and doing with that.

119
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,510
So if you do this you can see
this will actually break up and

120
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,870
let's do that one quickly here.

121
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,510
We had that.

122
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:40,157
Rc + r.

123
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,560
Dm that's the sum of two vectors.

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,120
So I'm going to do this, and say okay.

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,012
That's going to be Rc dm + rdm.

126
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:57,510
And my little subscript b that notation
is actually a triple integral.

127
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,570
I have to integrate over the entire body.

128
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,950
But instead of writing triple integrals
with all the limits, this is a short kind.

129
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,369
I just do one integral with b that mean
it understood to be integrating over

130
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:10,237
an entire, whenever this body is,
all right?

131
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,290
So we can break these things up.

132
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
That's nice.

133
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,980
That should be a vector.

134
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,161
Then there's some simplifications
that are going to happen.

135
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:24,450
We knew earlier, by definition,
this was M times Rc right?

136
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,711
This term can somebody say how
this is going to be refined?

137
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,137
All right?

138
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,460
Kevin.

139
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,908
>> You'll get RC out of the interval
>> Okay.

140
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:44,120
>> We get big M times R.

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,140
>> Yeah this is nothing but the sum of all
the mass elements which is the total mass.

142
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,940
You can get there.

143
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,870
So now Kevin can you explain
to me why it's okay to take

144
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,790
Rc varies with time and everything.

145
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,245
Why is it okay to take
it outside the integral?

146
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,080
>> because we're only
intergrating the phase.

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,940
>> Right.
>> We're integrating over the body.

148
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,280
So when you see these B integrals,
think of that, over this body,

149
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,414
let's say my center of mass was right
here by the microphone just easy right?

150
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:13,430
Stop I'm looking at this and
going at this instant,

151
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,070
whatever the mass distribution is,
my left hand is part of the system

152
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,050
the center of mass for the left hand is
still down here, right, for the system.

153
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,660
That Rc location for
the right hand is also going to be here.

154
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,520
Every element of my body,
because it's a continuum,

155
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,690
it shares the same
center of mass location.

156
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,128
So as far as the body integral goes,
it's just a constant.

157
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,450
Just like integral of 3 times x.

158
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,070
You pick the 3 outside the integral and
just do integral of x right?

159
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,050
And continue, that's how we can treat it.

160
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,920
So this is just a spatial integral.

161
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
Yes rt varies with time but

162
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,810
we're doing a spatial integration
over the body volume right?

163
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,830
And that location is a fixed it doesn't
change depending on if you're looking at

164
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,230
the nose of the spacecraft or
the tail of the spacecraft.

165
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,171
It's one system and that system
has one center of mass location.

166
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,841
So yes that's the reason, and
we'll use this trick several times today.

167
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:08,410
So if it didn't quite make sense now
hopefully it will sink in more and more.

168
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,240
So you can do all of this.

169
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,965
That gives me MRc Plus

170
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:19,170
little rdm = MRc.

171
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:27,458
These cancel and
you will have little r times dm = 0.

172
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,980
This is the other way.

173
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,490
If you do your classic sophomore
level center of mass stuff,

174
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,270
you have 5 kilograms here,
2 kilograms there, you add them up.

175
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,940
If all your positions are taken
relative to the center of mass.

176
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,730
All these mass times positions
have to sum up to be 0.

177
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,950
That means you've balanced it perfectly.

178
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,170
And that's what it looks like for
generally speaking.

179
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,810
We have the little r dm's body
integrals have to be equal to 0.

180
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,477
That's just a complete 3D version
that works for any jello.

181
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,508
So good.

182
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:01,370
So that, from here,
a few steps you can prove this.

183
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,230
These are the kind of things

184
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,100
I would definitely expect you to be able
to do easily and quickly in an exam.

185
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,604
So if you haven't done much of this,
practice.

186
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:12,480
Now, what we're going to do next is
we're going to differentiate this.

187
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,869
So we're going to take that
definition that we just had,

188
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:19,037
the center of mass location,
all this is good, and

189
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:22,072
I'm going to take two
inertial time derivatives.

190
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,960
So that means on the left hand side,
mass is constant.

191
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,050
I'm not losing or
gaining mass in this dynamical system.

192
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,010
And RC, I just have to put two
dots over it and I'm done.

193
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,837
This is kind of like homework 3.6
that you guys did that had inertial

194
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:35,120
derivatives and stuff.

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,580
In vectorial form this is dead simple,
two dots and you're done.

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,030
The right hand side dm I guess
doesn't change, we're not losing or

197
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,530
gaining mass with the system.

198
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,530
This is a body integral,
as Kevin was saying.

199
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,530
And so the only thing that varies is r.

200
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,510
So we get big R and
it has two dots over it.

201
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,487
But then you go back and look at Newton's
equation that mass times inertial

202
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:00,573
acceleration is the force
acting on that one.

203
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,520
And so
this can be replaced with also the force.

204
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,730
The integral over the DF force and

205
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,860
we show that the integral of the DF force
is nothing but the net external force.

206
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,240
You can ignore all the internal forces.

207
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,150
So you end up with an equation that
should look pretty darn familiar.

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,500
Mass acceleration equal to force.

209
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,140
But you've used it primarily
I'm assuming on particles.

210
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,900
This is the particle, here's the mass,

211
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,090
here's the force this is
where it's going to go.

212
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,770
This actually also works on a continuum.

213
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,720
Blobs in space.

214
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,953
Anybody seen the Muppet Show?

215
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,520
There was pigs in space, you know,
a lot of jiggling going on.

216
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,480
That's that kind of stuff.

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,200
This works for anything, even muppets.

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,930
Okay, so this is the key thing.

219
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,580
We call this the superparticle theorem.

220
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,660
What this basically says,

221
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,110
no matter what the dynamical system is,
this complete closed system,

222
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,110
you can treat the center of mass of that
system will act just like a particle.

223
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,860
If I know there is two forces
acting on it from a megatometer and

224
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,210
maybe from the atmospheric drag force
that Daniel was talking about, that's it.

225
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,860
Then those are the only two forces I have
to consider acting on the center of mass

226
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,254
and I will predict
the translational motion perfectly.

227
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:14,280
Now that blob may pull apart.

228
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,650
It may do all kinds of weird stuff.

229
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,910
So if your external force depends on
the shape, then it gets more complicated.

230
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,430
So if this blob would be pulling apart,
then with gravity gradients the part's

231
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,491
closer to the planets would have
different force than the parts top.

232
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:31,120
The net forces change
because of the shape.

233
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,760
That makes it more complicated.

234
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,010
But we didn't have gravity.

235
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,123
We have just net thrusters
you've got blobs in space.

236
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,810
Somebody fires a thruster.

237
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,660
And this thing is going to take off and
go.

238
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,030
Just by looking at the force and

239
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,980
knowing the mass, I can predict what's
going to happen to the center of mass.

240
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,680
I don't know what happens
to the shape yet, but

241
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,380
I do know what happens to
the center of mass of that system.

242
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,277
Which is a very powerful argument.

243
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:55,480
So that's what's called
the super particle theorem.

244
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,250
Any blob in space.

245
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,040
If you just are concerned
with the center of mass,

246
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,190
the center of mass will
act like a particular.

247
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,466
F = Ma holds but
F has to be the net external force.

248
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:10,620
M is the total mass and Rc double dots has
to be the inertial second time derivative.
