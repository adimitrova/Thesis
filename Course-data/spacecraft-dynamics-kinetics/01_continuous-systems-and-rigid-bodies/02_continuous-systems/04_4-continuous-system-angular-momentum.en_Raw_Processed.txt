a little bit curious, 
angular momentum 
angular momentum we to specify 
point taking moments 
we take torques a certain point 
wed measure angular momentum 
point typically in a system 
so here, i mean people often use 
center mass, im that nice 
im giving you a general point p 
so sigma is position vector 
dm relative to this moment point 
cough 
this is hinge point 
reason i want to know 
momentum this body 
is tumbling here 
that behave 
so well derive general formulation 
you will see sympathize 
to to classy 
answers many you familiar 
momentum here h 
point p angular momentum 
always position crossed linear 
momentum that quantity 
so sigma, that position 
vector relative to p, so 
i a dot, inertial derivative that 
you plug in 
sigma is r 
rp would position vector going 
here way up, right 
so sigma is nothing r rp 
you start plugging this in 
lets see, we differentiation 
so that we get a dot here 
we get a double 
dot second term 
this first one, trivially, goes to , 
a vector crossed is always , 
thats kind boring 
nice this will vanish 
left this term 
so, youre going to see okay 
now, happens this term 
we plugged instead sigma 
double dot, we r double dot 
rp double dot 
i plugged in 
now, you notice r, i cannot take 
outside body integral 
r depends element in 
body i pointing to 
so thats going to different 
every dm 
you cant take outside 
rp hand thats 
a general hinge point that i 
really connected to body 
keeping very, general 
so that one is fixed rp 
might stationary, might moving, 
might spinning 
knows 
whatever doing, 
if i differentiate twice, 
i need inertial acceleration 
second order derivative 
that one i take 
outside body integral 
so good, left term 
lets look this one 
if we focus whats 
body integral sigma dm 
so sigma, again, is r minus rp 
so i break that integral 
rdn minus integral rpdn, 
rp i take outside 
body integral, 
allows to 
get a mass times this 
this part, if you recognize it, 
that right hand side 
center mass definition 
right 
n times rc equal to body integral 
big rdm 
so im using that definition 
center mass definition 
so this becomes m rc, 
this one here becomes m a rp 
so this term here, 
i rewrite given there 
okay, wheres this going 
if we look torques, 
torques point b is 
basically moment arm cross 
force acting that particle 
so, if theres a magnetic torque 
bar mentioned earlier, 
may a particular torque, 
force acting 
moment that 
force relative to point p 
right, so 
sigma crossed r double dot 
dm is thing 
force acting that element 
if you write this, 
we rearrange this, so 
you see this term 
actually appeared here 
here, weve simplified that term to here, 

this first term appears nothing 
torque around that point p 
minus this, well that it, 
that is talk p 
so i use this, 
inertial derivative h point p 
is equal to torque point p, 
plus this stuff 
im leaving slightly greyed, 
we typically, 
a lot dynamics books dont 
talk this, least 
many people remember inertial 
derivative momentum is torque 
is true times 
so must true point p 
to make this second term vanish 
tosh, you make 
this term go to zero 
inaudible 
inaudible 
this doesnt matter actually 
this rc is, 
this true continuum is 
rigid one rp is an arbitrary 
point outside body that i picked 
i could place anywhere 
ck 
rp rc 
yeah, if you set rp, 
happens to equal to rc 
in that case, this one minus 
is zero that will vanish 
probably common use 
h dot equal to l is theyve assumed 
implicitly that is a center 
mass location, moments rc 
spacecraft staff 
if you keep spinning things, we will tend 
to use center mass a point, 
a pivot point 
we take moments 
doesnt to 
sometimes you a space craft 
a cad drawing, reason 
you got mass distribution 
is locations that 
like an offbalanced wheel 
sudden you to account 
that difference, 
this is you would to 
whats way 
theres a second way we 
make this term go to zero 
evan 
you make 
difference between rc 
rp perpendicular to 
acceleration rp 
okay, theres a third way 
you make go to zero 
laugh thats kind a hard 
way to retract that 
you might come 
a condition that would that 
good point 
whats second way 
you guys think 
roda is that 
we almost exhausted terms, 
whats left 
rp is constant 
a treat 
okay if rp is constant 
rp double is zero 
thats true i would say rp 
constant is a little bit 
rp dot is constant 
could also constant right 
so we call emotion that has, 
either fixed in space 
moving inertially 
a constant rate 
we call motion 
nonlinear, inertial, exactly 
definition something 
inertial, an inertial point typically is 
a non accelerating point, 
thats whats required 
condition is really 
rp double dot to 
if that point is nonaccelerating 
so if moving in a constant line, 
fine 
if something is spinning immediately 
centrifugal accelerations 
stuff, you know, 
going to to inertial 
you could take a point thats 
center mass, an inertial point 
you take moments 
h dot equal to l holds well 
so in fact, homeworks well 
getting you need to use 
sometimes you take hs 
ls center mass 
sometimes youre finding this inertial 
point, o, you there 
sets will give you 
information that you use to 
that, right 
so going to much 
general body fixed points 
different formulations that 
that exists, you look 
aware hr is equal to 
l is universally true 
true if you take 
moments center mass 
inertial points guaranteed 
this is going to go to zero 
two conditions 
well use in class
