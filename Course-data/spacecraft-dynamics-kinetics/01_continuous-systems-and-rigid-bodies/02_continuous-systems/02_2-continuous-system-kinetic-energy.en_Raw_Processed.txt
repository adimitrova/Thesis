let us fun 
kinetic energies 
particles, you guys know that 
thats mass two times 
velocity squared essentially, 
thats youve 
this is vectorial form that 
i dm, so 
instead mass i dm two 
thats essentially that 
times inertial speed squared 
im this in a vectorial way, 
so r dot is my, you 
know if r is inertial position vector, 
i need to inertial velocity 
thats first inertial time 
derivative r, thats an r dot 
im dotting itself, 
thats going to give inertial 
velocity magnitude squared 
a vectorial way to write it, 
a general way to write this 
so thats 
thats one dm, 
i need whole blob 
you simply integrate body 
thats integral comes in 
summing 
so good, we kinetic energy 
thats convenient form 
we dont typically write this 
way kind hard 
we would like to break in terms 
rc kinetic energy center 
mass looking kinetic 
energy center mass 
that will help us separate rotational 
stuff, deformational stuff 
translational stuff 
thats youll see 
popping this 
so lets this 
r dot 
r defined rc r, so r dot, 
you put dots everywhere 
again, vectorial form, dead simple, right 
comes back 
dont part b 
part a we take time 
derivatives vectorial parts 
you plug this in 
you carry various dot products 
you guys know to basic 
dot products in calculus 
im going to that 
so we end terms 
and, kevin saying earlier, in 
body intervals, anything thats rc 
rc dot, going to things 
that fixed body interval 
every point in that blob 
center mass 
therefore, 
center mass velocity 
so we always treat quantities 
constants integration 
so you carry, you know, 
this is a step im here, 
im purposely not, i want you 
guys to, you this 
cough run notes, 
thats going to stick 
if we that, pulled 
thing gets pulled here 
end theres a factor 
two half that cancels, 
you also this term 
one will go to zero 
medal 
one is going to zero 
tom tom 
is this one going to zero 
thats always second question 
first part is 
might lucky 
recognizes this part 
trevor 
well, we went that body 
integral radius times 
thats vector 
radius 
let correct quickly 
thats position vector 
position vector, yeah, 
thats inaudible 
radius would a scalar 
crosstalk so 
thats equal to zero 
yes 
take 
derivative that 
that still zero 
exactly without dot this is nothing 
center mass definition 
we rewrote that instead mass 
average location also saying that if 
locations relative to center 
mass summing ups to give 
you zero 
so integral little r times dn is zero 
so therefore, derivative 
zero is still going to zero 
so this one, center mass location 
this is, basically, 
using center mass definition 
that one will go to zero leaving 
us this term this term 
this term is nothing 
total mass 
so i a big m 
so mass velocity squared, 
so you see 
blob, center mass acts like 
a particle again, is really nice 
if youre an orbit problem, 
this would orbital energy 
spacecraft basically 
second part is this integral, 
body integral r dot, so 
thats position vector, 
dm relative to center mass 
get inertial derivative though 
thats important 
this is a dot 
this is a body frame derivative 
thats inertial derivative 
we sum 
so this is basically kinetic 
energy center mass 
in this form contains two parts 
one part kinetic energy 
comes rotation 
if stuff is rotating 
things could spinning, 
that gives you that 
kind kinetic energy 
part is this is blobs, 
you might deformational energy, 
things changing shape 
well youre redistributing mass 
im gaining losing mass in this 
system, im redistributing 
so if you fuel slosh bouncing around, 
thats one example you know 
so you might deformational 
energy happening here 
so thats that is, 
this is kinetic energy a jello, 
written in form, basic form 
now, we often want to power, 
that means time 
derivative kinetic energy 
we that expression, broken 
translational part cm 
energy cm 
if you differentiate this, 
you come here 
let show you that one trick 
if you dont see that, 
to go there 
if you a vector, x dotted x 
if i a scalar x squared 
i take a time derivative scalar 
i will simply times x times x dot, 
right 
simple 
here, if you this vectorial 
quantities i mean expressions 
we see a lot vectors dotted 
vectors again, especially 
if you this you take a time 
derivative here, im going to 
take an inertial time derivative, so 
i put dots vectors 
chain rule, you would x dot, 
dotted x, 
plus x dotted x dot, right 
is this 
times x dotted x dot 
i simply add two things 
inaudible reverse order 
right 
answer here, 
dot part is actually a scalar 
so if you this in vector form 
a dotted b is thing b 
dotted a 
if youre in matrix form this 
would written a trans x 
transpose x 
right 
equivalent 
in that case too, 
answer is a scalar 
so scalar you transpose 
scalar 
so allows you to reverse matrix 
order right transposes 
this is nothing vector form 
so here, here we end 
times x times x dot, 
you couldve rewritten this 
putting dot first one 
whatevers convenient in 
analytical development 
so practice that if you havent 
thats i go r dot r dot 
one half cancels two 
thing here 
little r dots theres a one half in front 
that cancels two that 
comes differentiation 
this is you end 
going to apply stuff 
we know super particle 
theorem that mass time initial 
acceleration center mass 
is equal to net external force 
so thats good 
so we plug in this becomes nothing 
f 
here little r dot we 
to a little math 
we knew that big r is rc plus little r, 
so you put two dots everything 
we inertial derivatives 
quantities, 
i plug that one in 
so that will break this integral 
rc double dot, dotted r dot 
and, sorry, theres an r double dot 
a rc double dot that plugs in 
you break math, this is 
form that youre going to 
so this part is actually pretty much done 
so power equation gives you 
force dotted velocity 
shift makes sense, 
hopefully high school physics, 
if you look power stuff 
thats typically always force 
times a velocity measure 
thats instantaneous power 
produced mechanically 
parts, 
going to to look 
here, anybody see a term 
thats going to go to zero 
one end 
yep, this one again, right 
due to center mass property 
things will pop everywhere 
we love that, zero is great 
really simplifies stuff 
so going to see that one go 
to zero this is nothing 
mass times initial acceleration an 
infinitesimal element that nothing 
df, that little force 
so body, this is general power 
expression that you would to 
you write, if you to 
energy change between two points, 
you would integrate 
equations time 
this is one form 
you a substitution variables 
this is a classic thing youve probably 
seen you also force times 
distance gives you energy 
take put this system 
so, you replace 
theres different forms 
you write this 
this is general one 
well use in class will 
rigid body specific one, 
i wanted to highlight 
first general formulation 
going to write later 
this one doesnt make much 
sense practically you right 
you make rigid, well 
a turn that would clear 
this is we compute this
