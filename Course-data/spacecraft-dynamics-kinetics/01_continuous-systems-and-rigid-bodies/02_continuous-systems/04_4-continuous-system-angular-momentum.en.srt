1
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,310
A little bit more curious,
angular momentum.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,840
With angular momentum we have to specify
about which point we're taking moments.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,680
We take torques about a certain point and

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,490
we'd measure angular momentum about
the same point typically in a system.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,880
So here, I mean people often use
center of mass, but I'm not that nice.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,734
I'm giving you a general point p.

7
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:31,892
And so sigma is now my position vector
of dm relative to this moment point.

8
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:33,920
>> [COUGH]
>> This is the hinge point.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,518
For some reason I want to know
momentum about this on my body

10
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:37,975
is tumbling out here.

11
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:38,985
How does that behave?

12
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:43,485
So we'll derive the general formulation
and then you will see when it sympathize

13
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,856
down to the down to the classy
answers many of you are familiar with.

14
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:50,035
The momentum here H about
point P angular momentum.

15
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:53,775
It's always position crossed linear
momentum of that same quantity.

16
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:57,430
So sigma, that was my position
vector relative to P, so

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,380
I have a dot, inertial derivative on that.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,120
And you plug it in.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
Sigma is R.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,760
RP would be the position vector going
from here all the way up, right?

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,920
So sigma is nothing but R- RP.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,570
You should start plugging this in.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,270
Let's see, we do it with differentiation
so that we get a dot here and

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,560
then we get a double
dot on the second term.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,030
>> This first one, trivially, goes to 0,
a vector crossed itself is always 0,

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,050
that's kind of boring.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,720
But it's nice because this will vanish and
we're left with this term.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,870
So, you're going to see okay.

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,140
Now, what happens with this term?

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,590
And we plugged instead of sigma
double dot, we have R double dot and

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,990
Rp double dot.

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,580
And I plugged those in.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,060
Now, you notice R, I cannot take
outside of the body integral because

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,160
R depends on which element in
the body am I pointing to.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
So that's going to be different for
every dm.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,880
You just can't take it outside.

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,470
Rp on the other hand that's
a general hinge point that I have.

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not really connected to the body and
keeping it very, very general.

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,520
And so that one is just fixed Rp.

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,240
Might be stationary, it might be moving,
it might be spinning or

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,680
who knows what it's doing.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,870
And whatever it's doing,
if I differentiate it twice,

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,040
I need its inertial acceleration.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,620
Its second order derivative.

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,210
But that one I can take
outside of my body integral.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,180
So good, we're left with those term.

47
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,150
Now let's look at this one.

48
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,790
If we focus just on what's
the body integral of sigma dm.

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,520
So sigma, again, is r minus rp.

50
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,470
So I can break that up as the integral
of Rdn minus the integral of Rpdn, but

51
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,900
Rp I can take outside
of the body integral,

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,110
which allows me to just
get a mass times this.

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,330
And this part, if you recognize it,

54
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,310
that was the right hand side of
the center of mass definition.

55
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,830
Right?
n times Rc was equal to body integral

56
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,330
big Rdm.

57
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,810
So I'm using that definition from
the other center of mass definition.

58
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,630
So this just becomes M Rc,
this one here becomes M and then a Rp.

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,540
So this term here,
I can rewrite as given by there.

60
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,360
Okay, where's this going?

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,520
If we look at torques,
the torques about point B is

62
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,410
basically the moment arm cross with
the force acting on that particle.

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,440
So, if there's a magnetic torque
bar as mentioned earlier,

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,100
it may have a particular torque,
force acting.

65
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Once the moment of that
force relative to point P.

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,120
All right, so
it's sigma crossed R double dot

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,810
dm which is the same thing as
the force acting on that element.

68
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,530
If you write this,
we can rearrange this, and so

69
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,340
you can see this term
actually appeared over here.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,610
Here, we've simplified that term to here,
but

71
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,310
this first term appears as being nothing
but the torque around that point P.

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,820
Minus this, well that was it,
that is the talk about p.

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,840
So I can use this,
the inertial derivative of H about point p

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,670
is equal to the torque about point p,
plus this other stuff.

75
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,628
And I'm leaving it as slightly greyed,
because we typically,

76
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:10,480
a lot of dynamics books don't
talk about this, at least.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,810
Many people just remember the inertial
derivative on momentum is torque

78
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,260
which is true at times.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,760
So what must be true of point p
to make this second term vanish?

80
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:31,166
Tosh, how can you make
this term go to zero?

81
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:36,633
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> No because [INAUDIBLE] or

82
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:41,770
not this doesn't matter actually.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,010
This only has Rc which is,
this true for continuum as it is for

84
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,170
rigid one and RP is just an arbitrary
point outside of the body that I picked.

85
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,350
And I could place it anywhere.

86
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,330
CK.

87
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,090
>> RP at RC.

88
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,540
>> Yeah, if you set RP,
it happens to be equal to RC.

89
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,200
In that case, this one minus itself
is zero and that will vanish.

90
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,551
And then probably the most common use
of h dot equal to l is they've assumed

91
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,470
implicitly that is about a center of
mass location, all moments are about Rc.

92
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,530
And for spacecraft staff and

93
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,120
if you keep spinning things, we will tend
to use the center of mass as a point,

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,350
a pivot point about which
we take all of the moments.

95
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,450
But it doesn't have to be.

96
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,350
Sometimes you have a space craft and
a CAD drawing, and for some reason

97
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,060
what you got with the mass distribution
is all the locations are not about that.

98
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,920
It's like an off-balanced wheel.

99
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,330
All of the sudden you have to account for
that difference, and

100
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,240
this is what you would have to do.

101
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,390
What's the other way?

102
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,550
There's a second way we can
make this term go to zero.

103
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,520
Evan.

104
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,580
>> You can make
the difference between Rc and

105
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,610
Rp perpendicular to
the acceleration of Rp.

106
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,055
>> Okay, there's a third way
you can make it go to zero.

107
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:56,400
[LAUGH] That's kind of a hard
way to retract that but

108
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,140
you might come up with
a condition that would do that.

109
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,230
Good point.

110
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,180
What's the second way?

111
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,485
What do you guys think?

112
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,720
Roda what is that?

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,670
We have almost exhausted all the terms,
what's left?

114
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,930
>> RP is constant.

115
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,270
A treat of.

116
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,190
>> Okay if RP is constant
the RP double both is zero.

117
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,880
But that's true but I would say RP
being constant is a little bit.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,610
>> RP dot is constant.

119
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,480
>> Could also be constant right?

120
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,640
So what do we call emotion that has,
either it's fixed in space or

121
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,220
it's only moving inertially
at a constant rate?

122
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,410
What do we call such motion?

123
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,960
No not nonlinear, inertial, exactly.

124
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,030
The definition for something being
inertial, an inertial point typically is

125
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,630
it's a non accelerating point,
and that's what's required.

126
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,040
The condition is really just
RP double dot has to be 0.

127
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,220
If that point is non-accelerating.

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,170
So if it's moving in a constant line,
we're fine.

129
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,650
If something is spinning immediately
it's centrifugal accelerations and

130
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,280
stuff, you know,
it's not going to to be inertial.

131
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,920
But you could take a point that's not
center of mass, but it's an inertial point

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,160
about which you take moments and
then H dot equal to L holds as well.

133
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,220
So in fact, some of the homeworks we'll
be getting into you need to use both.

134
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,850
Sometimes you take Hs and
Ls about center of mass.

135
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,270
And sometimes you're finding this inertial
point, o, and you can do it there.

136
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,920
And both sets will give you some
information that you can use to do

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,690
that, all right?

138
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,790
So we're not going to do much
about general body fixed points or

139
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,080
other different formulations of that
that exists, you can look them up.

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,390
Just be aware Hr is equal to
l is not universally true.

141
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,670
It's only true if you take your
moments about center of mass or

142
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,300
inertial points then we're guaranteed
this is going to go to zero.

143
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,920
Those are two conditions
we'll use in class.
