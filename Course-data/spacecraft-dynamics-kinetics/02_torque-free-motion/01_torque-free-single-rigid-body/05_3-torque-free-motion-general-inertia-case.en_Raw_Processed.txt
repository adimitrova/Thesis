torque free motion 
momentum to constant 
momentum magnitude to constant, 
is im writing 
here in first equation 
kinetic energy to constant 
so considering actual 
mechanical energy loss right 
like, before, like paul will plots, 
lets assume 
h perfectly preserved 
you write momentum energy 
constraints in terms omegas 
h i omega, so that 
magnitude is component squared 
thats easy, magnitude squared 
kinetic energy , so 
comes to lefthand side 
this one to make a transpose 
i omega, that i is a diagonal 
again, makes easy 
this is form that you would 
two constraints 
we three variables 
quickly this illustrates again, 
that omega curve that youre 
going to get isnt going to a plane 
a volume, solution space 
going to one dimensional curve 
in three dimensional omega space, right 
thats looking 
we three unknowns, omega one, 
two three two constraints 
so i always use two constraints 
thats im laying here 
i say, okay well let pick to 
write everything in terms omega 

first thing one that 
appears 
so i use this 
solve omega squared 
thats you in this equation 
i solve this 
omega squared comes here 
so youve got two equations 
two terms, omega one 
two that im solving for, so 
rule algebra you reduce 
so, constrains if i 
an omega one i know momentum 
i know energy added 
beginning, i quickly tell you 
magnitude squared omega two 
thing omega three, right 
so way 
rewriting momentum 
energy constrains 
exclusively in omega terms 
makes omega special 
nothing really 
theres nothing special omega 
you couldve easily solved 
everything in terms omega 
you couldve used in two equations 
say, well, 
im going to solve everything 
omega in terms omega , right 
you solve this way you wish 
substitute 
i will use 
this in paper junkins, 
jacobson, 
blanton that youve got 
a reference here 
actually 
you werent even born 
an eloquent result here 
you will see, 
this analogy to 
axisymmetric cases 
gives you a general 
formulation that you dont often see 
so this page, weve done is weve 
taken momentum energy equations 
weve used to express omegas 
in terms momentum energy 
one omegas, thats 
so lets go back to original problem 
this is one trying to solve 
weve got differential equations 
theres ls righthand 
side theres torque 
we solve this 
axis symmetry, 
one 
so we could say omega is fixed 
therefore we took a derivative this, 
substitute others, right 
came nicely decoupled ones 
everything varies time 
i longer that trick directly 
theres still similar steps 
going to start 
kind a step 
we three fully coupled 
nonlinear differential equations, 
whereas i two coupled 
linear differential equations 
im still going to take a derivative 
worked so well axis 
metric lets try here, right 
you this, chain rule, 
omega is omega omega , everything 
varies time, here you go, to make 
a , , double outs divided inertia 
thats basically 
so youre going okay, 
great, is this going 
so you took a derivative 
similar to axis 
symmetric case, omega dot 
axis symmetric depended 
omega omega constant 
well, going to 
is we plug in second 
third differential equation here 
rewrite this 
you end this expression 
here that you going to 
so omega , 
is equal to omega omega squared 
omega omega squared 
you see theres 
still quite coupled 
theres still nonlinear i went 
three non linear first order differential 
equations to three non linear second 
order differential equations 
seems like going backwards, 
making much progress 
heres elegant thing now, 
prior slide, 
i example omega squared 
in terms a constant 
something times omega 
thing omega squared 
so if you look second 
order differential equations, 
here is omega , omega 
i write omega squared in 
terms a constant omega 
thing omega squared 
so using momentum 
kinetic energy constraints, 
i substitute in 
instead time varying quantities, 
i everything in terms constants 
energy consular momentum magnitude 
you one, 
you follow process here 
we use here expressions omega 
written in terms omega 
here we use third set that writes 
omega in terms omega , right 
theres three different ways we could 
take two constraints solve 
two to three variables 
if you that plug in, 
so thats process, 
equations we found, 
you plug in here 
you thing 
two look happens in end 
this is omega , 
a bunch constants 
omega times constant something 
times omega squared 
so youre going to get omega term 
something times omega squared 
will give you omega cubed essentially 
so final form everyone 
omegas, i write a, 
whats called a homogeneous 
undamped duffing equations 
homogeneous means 
right hand side is 
undamped, theres omega dot 
omega double dots omegas 
duffing equation, is this classic, 
this would a spring mass equation 
duffing equation is a spring mass 
a cubic stiffness term added to it, so 
like a cubic spring instead 
a linear spring 
a common modeling 
thing to see well 
so, three omegas actually 
an equation this form 
you would 
bs depend omega , , 
you see, 
inertias computed differently, 
you plug in, energy 
momentum come in different terms so 
we formulas 
bs to 
so this is actually elegant 
we often see systems that are, 
we end x double dot plus kx, 
right 
if x double dot plus k equal to , 
trivial to talk 
linear stability, least 
youve linearized system 
small motions locally 
if k is positive, we know well 
a restoring force let draw 
that to mute that 
so if you, if i m 
forget m, well normalized 
that means x double dot kx 
so if x is here, you look 
happens to x double dot 
if x is positive, 
x double dot is going to negative 
a linear relationship 
so if youre far ahead, force is 
going to restore you back to origin 
if youre far behind, 
x is negative, 
k positive value that 
makes positive, you catch 
this gives you typical oscillator 
equation that youd have, 
a stable motion 
so that works 
this result is typically due 
to a linearization that you get 
here we linearized 
anything we derived this 
no, we used full nonlinear 
differential equations, 
differentiated them, 
substituted in energy momentum, 
you end three equations, 
weve a first order term a cubic term 
cubic term , if you structures, 
you often see this cubic term 
result an approximation 
you go beyond 
first order stiffness, 
next term people typically 
include is cubic term 
if fractions get really big like 
strain hardening a spring something 
you get this extra stiffness that 
comes in, thats cubic term 
again, 
in structures, thats an approximation 
a much complex behavior 
like next order 
term thats included 
here this is a perfectly 
rigorous equation 
so in structures, 
this is often found an approximation 
here theres approximation 
is exact thing 
tumbling general inertia, motions 
so good, so we want to study this 
a little bit detail 
we three equations 
we parts, 
that axisymmetric case 
easy, spring mass 
a sine 
a cosine response, right 
here going to get 
a little complicated 
unfortunately i dont analytic 
answers we axisymmetric 
codes there arguments we 
talk like global stability 
motions departures that you write 
in this form is kind a nice thing 
so yeah, 
ill lead departure hookes law 
thats linear part, 
this is an exact differential equation 
so we this 
so this is actually three equations 
three equations decoupled 
cough 
sorry, name 
mark 
mark, decoupled 
yes 
okay 
independent 
yes 
well, constants 
you said conviction 
you almost convinced 
independent 
everybody agrees theyre decoupled 
if you look this equation 
omega in there 
next term omega 
one omega theres 
omega times omega 
we originally 
so we definitely made independent 
you initial conditions 
parameters you solve three 
independent differential equations 
numerically get answer 
independent is something 
different that means, 
lets say i a spin 
omega 
next simulation is a spin omega 
tumble b something 
is omega 
a different b 
will different in 
differential equations 
youre right, 
arent independent, matt 
energy momentum terms 
exactly 
energy momentums actually 
cross couples them, so 
theyre independent 
i cant go well, 
if omega is one radium per second, 
i a fixed answer thats true 
coefficients that go 
here depend momentum energy 
so a little bit complicated 
if you also tumbling another access, 
energy state is different, 
momentum states different, 
that will give you different bs 
so you to solve 
that particular case 
so there three uncoupled equations 
independent equations 
is that make sense 
theyre coupled this coefficients 
energy momentum, precisely 
so, three uncoupled oscillators 
thats there 
if i write to bs, this 
is are, you see, 
h appeared 
inertias always same, 
body 
math saying, 
if h is different 
is different, i would different 
coefficients, a sudden 
we get a different response 
omegas, right 
so thats matter 
elegant so general 
case you always write this 
a harmonious, 
homogenous to duffling equation 
parameters well look 
this a little bit carefully 
you see, 
example, cubic stiffness terms bs, 
theres differences inertias 
so we know right away 
if axis symmetric, 
things will go away, 
insight you get 
time, 
id say if a cube 
a sphere, terms go away 
a sphere, none that matters 
even in here theres always differences 
inertia so sphere again, 
bs go away we talked 
a sphere you tumble axis 
itll continue to tumble, 
mega , , flat lines, 
always, a cube response 
general bodies, 
if i is largest inertia 
you see this is going to 
a positive term times a positive term, 
this is going to 
a positive cubic stiffness 
here again, if i is largest, 
so this is going to negative, 
thats negative, 
negative times negative is positive 
well a positive 
stiffness whereas here 
youll a negative stiffness 
so is positive stiffness good 
bad a stability a cubic one 
good 
good 
pretty much analogous 
instead a liner response, you 
something thats kind cubic 
you need kind a sign, 
right 
if youre positive, you want something 
pulling you back to origin 
origin is equilibrium 
that well studying here 
if youre negative, you want 
something positive to pull you back 
got to aggressive 
big departures, 
way less aggressive small departures 
so theres a difference 
in cubic terms 
thats a linearization, this is 
linear part going to dominate 
if you go really big departures, 
cubic one is always going to win 
point, 
x cubed is going to bigger x, 
regardless constant 
coefficients are, bs 
so good 
so you see looking 
signs this we get 
insight 
must happening 
well cover this a little bit in 
another slide we go
