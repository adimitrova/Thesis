going to next is 
going to spend a little bit time, 
least two lectures, talking 
torque free motion, 
spacecraft this is 
a pretty common situation 
youre always thrusting 
youre always reacting, youre 
using lots resources, energy, fuel 
so we understand 
torque free motion 
in fact theres many missions that exploit 
torque free motions to spin stabilize 
kinds stuff 
well look 
disturbances like gravity gradients, 
well derive that scratch using 
much kind notation 
dual spinners, thats another one 
well jump 
control stuff afterwards 
okay, so i didnt 
put that one 
lets talk torquefree 
attitude motion 
weve saying today, 
h dot is equal to l 
if torquefree 
l becomes zero 
that says nerve, whatever this 
vector is, h is a vector in space 
a vector a magnitude 
times a direction 
saying h dot equal to l 
is that seen an inertial observer, 
this vector is fixed 
so that means, you seen before, 
h is equal to i omega, we compute 
this stuff, we i in body 
frame, we omega in body frame 
we often write h is equal 
to something, something, 
something in body frame 
body frame components h 
torque free motion zero 
inertias fixed, omegas 
going to vary, go back forth 
if you reconstruct in body frame, 
this is vector is, 
you know body attitude is 
so times bn, right 
you map back end frame 
those, three inertia frame 
components to fixed 
thats essentially 
here 
this is in body frame 
this is typically we write 
here weve assumed type 
body frame to get this form 
principle, exactly 
diagonal 
well this a lot analysis 
we always this anybody 
simplifies basic stability 
analysis that looking 
so that we that 
times dcm in 
whatever coordinates you wish 
people that use 
something besides mrp 
i want to highlight that 
that happen 
so you get this 
you to take derivative 
this is n frame components 
you to take derivative 
this stuff set equal to zero 
you get a lot theta one dots 
omega dots yeah that to 
true i this dots 
insightful 
so thats this is 
fundamentally happens 
so this is a good test if 
youre writing an integrator 
you give initial attitude 
give a spin 
torque 
set torque to zero 
that equations motion let tumble 
let spin 
you watch attitude history 
every time step, 
if you compute this 
attitude computed dcn, 
map momentum coordinates 
body inertial frame, 
you three coordinates 
that give you perfect flat lines 
if that, 
you get really warm fuzzy feelings 
that integrator is working 
a guarantee that you get 
warm fuzzy feelings something 
theres always ways people 
get creative screw things 
but, if you preserve momentum 
in inertial frame 
thats a really good indicator 
youre right track 
good numerical checks, 
good analysis 
so next step is 
analytical insight 
we look this stuff 
so really, key component is we want 
to everything in body frame 
helps us 
we want to look at, we want to 
make use that momentum is preserved 
if torque free motion is there 
something else that preserved well 
cough 
momentum 
yes, spencer, energy actually 
you remember power equation dot 
ended omega dotted l, 
l 
that one cases, 
we get power system 
so inaudible to 
preserved well 
thats a result well jump next 
so if you everything in body frame, 
h equal to i omega 
omega, in body frame is 
classic omega one b one, 
omega two b two, so forth 
if you take in h vector 
putting in body frames, 
im using h one, h two, h three 
thats labels b 
frame components h vector 
i omega means h one 
must i one omega one 
thats that first vector component h, 
im using a principle frame 
that diagonalised stuff 
is saying okay, 
good we going this 
written age in body frame 
instead using 
a rewritten version prior 
slide going to next is 
instead saying three in actual 
vector component to constant, 
nice flat lines you plot out, 
going to 
focus magnitude 
magnitude is a scalar 
we discussed in first week, 
to take a derivative a scalar 
doesnt a framed dependency 
so if h a vector is 
constant in frame, 
that must mean magnitude 
to constant well 
therefore, 
magnitude is something i always 
compute even in body frame components 
so thats a nice trick 
we go, okay, we get magnitude 
well, going to get magnitude 
squared dotting h 
in a matrix form we h transpose h 
math, gives you stuff 
so this times gives you i one 
squared, omega one squared, i two squared, 
omega two squared 
you start adding 
this to 
give you a constant 
whatever spin you gave system 
whatever gyrations going 
things to add 
omega ones twos 
threes vary time 
to add to give you 
number in end momentum 
so good this gives one equation 
kinetic energy 
one that we talked 
if you look kinetic energy that 
one half omega transpose i omega, 
if i is diagonal really 
simplifies quickly 
you end one half 
inertia rate squared 
principle axis, thats 
energy is also preserved 
so you notice in two equations, 
independent coordinates omegas 
giving an initial spin, 
i know omegas, rates, change 
that gives three degrees freedom 
rates, subject to two constraints 
momentum magnitude to fixed 
energy to fixed 
so in end jordan, two constraints, 
three degrees freedom, 
many degrees 
freedom you left 
one, right 
so that means immediately, 
we top free motion, 
omega time history become to 
a single curve in three dimensional space 
a one b sub space 
that we to find 
so right looking this 
we intercept this, this, 
predict that behaves 
this is quite geometrically intuitive 
thats next stuff comes 
let go back here 
could somebody tell 
replace omega one, 
two three x, y 
z three coordinates 
that tracking 
if you ax squared plus bx 
squared plus y squared plus cz 
squared equal to a constant 
type shape you describing 
okay, a circle this 
is a three dimensional shape 
a sphere 
crosstalk 
a, b, c different 
if a, b, 
c would ge a sphere 
so is shape 
ellipsoid 
an ellipsoid that you actually, 
this is a classic equation 
surface an ellipsoid 
so that means, this is kind like stuff, 
we this d hyper sphere, 
thats hard to visualize 
a d surface, i draw, so 
well see visualizations this 
this equation actually 
means that solutions 
omega , , , reside this ellipsoid 
ellipsoid a constant shape, 
change shape time 
inaudible 

x,y, 
z parameters inaudible time 
x, y, 
z independent coordinates 
lets look that 
much fire, okay 
if we this, this is a classic 
way, you might see this ellipsoid 
thats constant, 
right is this an ellipse 
if a, b, c constants is 
this an ellipse a fixed shape, 
is this ellipse varying size 
fixed shape 
fixed shape, right 
so here we 
a lot coordinates that 
people get quickly confused is 
is independent stuff that 
looking 
so omegas would independent things, 
like x, y z 
you see in classic ellipsoidal, 
wiki notes something 
i, , principle inertias 
that fixed in time we 
a rigid body 
if werent rigid, 
would fixed things 
well see that actually dual 
spinners, so you multiple buttons 
thing here, 
this also will make a squared y 
so thats x squared y squared 
z squared times constant 
equals to something thats constant 
this is also an ellipse, so 
that that george talking right, 
thats space we 
actually looking 
we two constraints, 
this is an ellipse, thats an ellipse 
this two to intercepted thats 
answer, thats intuitive, 
easy to intercept 
two ellipsis to 
so people came 
this approach 
instead treating omega one, two, three, 
independent coordinates 
trying to figure whats happening 
we use scaled versions omega one, 
two, three 
basically you multiply in times 
principle inertias so new independent 
coordinates simply body frame 
angular momentum vector components 
so im treating h, , 
i find h, , time histories, 
to map back to omegas, 
i is divide principal 
inertias you get omegas 
if you this, you get momentum, 
constraint looks like this, 
type geometric shape is this 
this is a sphere, right, 
basically constants equal to x 
square plus y square plus z square 
so this is definitely a sphere, 
thats easy to draw, you will see 
energy constraint, 
in terms this, 
i will let you this 
you to plug in that h 
is i omega, yeah we arrange 
you end getting energy constraint 
divided gives you this 
this is kind a classic normalized 
forward ellipsoidal 
form is something old square equal to one 
this terms if you go look 
ellipsoids you could easily 
become related to semiminor, 
semiintermediate, 
semimajor axes that ellipsoid 
that youre going to have, right 
this is a unit, a unit sphere 
a sphere size h, you 
get energies that come in there, 
this is something we 
start to put together 
so torquefree motion, 
to consider happens to rates 
time youre jumbling tirading 
anybody, this is nothing cylindrical 
symmetric, inertias 
two constraints, weve 
moved omega space to h space, 
that gave us a simpler way to 
geometrically find things 
so thats a sphere, 
this is classic ellipsoidal equations, 
that you find a, bs cs 
youre semiaxes 
three things, so yep, 
thats you find there 
so well three, 
if we three distinct inertias, 
you will three distinct axis, 
a key element is well lets see, 
vary a spacecraft 
im full simple questions this morning 
torquefree motion, 
theres external torque 
acting a spacecraft, 
could vary, ansel 
yeah 
could h vary 
if torquefree, external 
force acting spacecraft 
you dont think so, 
you guessing, you feeling lucky 
h l, goes back to that 
is that good a rigid body 
yes, is good a continuum 
yeah, so if you spacecraft 
rigid, fuel slosh 
people wandering around in there, 
a space station 
big panels that flex, 
space station again, huge panels right 
h dot equal to l still holds, 
if theres external torque acting 
system, h to preserved 
so torquefree motions, 
we always treat h a constant 
thats religion, i mean, 
doesnt change, t, though, energy 
we say this is rigid, 
rigid is structure, 
everything a little bit flex 
theres always something, 
maybe stiff, 
there is always amount flexing 
so soon you flex, 
happens mechanically 
happens to energy state 
yeah, youre going to 
start dissipating energy 
theres always a resistance to flexing 
theres damping coefficient 
might really, really small 
if internal friction theres stuff 
rubbing ach there 
theres walls, theres always 
friction ways to dissipate energy, so 
even though might almost rigid 
you nothing is truly rigid 
so in practice in this math we 
assuming right perfectly rigid 
thats an artefact mathematics 
in real life an engineer we 
realize nothing is perfectly rigid, 
in fact first satellite 
that went us 
explorer 
explorer 
explorer 
kind in this shape, go hey, 
we looked this equations 
if we spin this axis 
i heard spinning stabilizes things, 
so spun this axis right 
big antenna sticking out, 
thats communicated 
antenna flopping, 
stuff, anybody remember 
long went unstable 
less an orbit, bery glorious 
that started to listen 
to astrodynamicist go 
to help if you right axis 
right stuff, right 
so that one is flexing 
definitely lost energy 
you will see here shortly 
constraints 
this leads to something that 
unstable, actually, 
move towards 
theres definite stable equilibrium, 
this spin, 
youre spinning this nice 
symmetry axis, skinny one, right 
so energy vary, 
that means, momentum doesnt, 
if torquefree, 
momentum sphere is locked 
that amount momentum there is 
a finite range energies that you 
have, this ellipsoid 
to intercept momentum 
so theres a minimum energy 
state you have, 
theres a maximum energy 
state you 
so you a fixed amount 
momentum you cannot predict 
actual energy state is 
theres a range energies you 
we dissipate energy we go one to 
another 
happens though we change energy, 
you see x principle inertia 
x energy takes square root 
energy scales, going to 
scale axes simultaneously 
so this ellipsoid, basically, 
grows homogeneously 
shrinks homogeneously energy 
you change energy, you dont make 
this ellipsoid longer in one direction 
skinnier in another 
grows scales evenly 
right 
thats key 
thing you want to get 
this equation 
good, now, lets look this 
this is first many figures 
going to assume, 
without loss in generality, 
that principal in body frame, 
principal frame, 
lined that b 
gives axis maximum inertia 
that would like kind like 
this axis here this box 
you b is axis 
intermediate inertia 
thats one inbetween 
that would this 
kind a skinnier side 
axis least inertia is here 
we said principal frames 
is to find that permutation 
i always choose a frame 
this is true 
so, i dont to this 
math six different ways 
i 
you flip 
frames if needed 
plotting 
things in momentum corner space 
omega space 
we realize that omega omega h, 
sorry h h omega times i 
so forth 
momentum shows a sphere, 
thats nice 
ellipsoid shows here, 
to intercept 
so, we said earlier weve got three 
coordinates looking for, omega , 
, , subject to two constraints 
answer must a curve 
thats curve is 
is that intersection 
theres one im showing 
backside 
thank you 
laugh 
so, even here, so 
if you energy specified 
momentum specified, theres actually two 
possible trajectories you could 
theyre related 
theyre kind mirror images 
shape isnt flat, 
this is kind potatoshaped 
things, ellipsoid, 
wrapped around a sphere, 
thats intersection 
curve looks like 
thats you would 
here you would wobble 
around in this direction, 
there in this direction 
so, this gives you something, 
this scale body inertia, 
you tell right away, 
this is omegas to reside 
this also used 
an integration check 
so we play energy levels 
start to look different spin conditions 
also talk stability 
so, i know, you taking , 
youve seen slides 
so, well quickly go to new stuff 
h, lets look 
smallest ellipse you 
if you shrink energy 
remember axes proportional 
to principal inertias so this axis b 
that largest principal inertia 
longest elongation 
if you shrink ellipsis small you 
make it, longest elongation is 
going to point that 
barely touches momentum sphere 
thats kind geometric 
interpretation 
so that means, 
kind spin you 
thats a single intersection point here 
here 
so that means, in this case, 
you a spin thats 
either youre rotating positive 
negative b axis, youre 
a pure spin a principle axis 
so in this case here, 
actually would wobble 
youd spinning this case that way 
so h you 
an h axis intercept, thats there 
you plug back equations, 
in kinetic equations 
in end, if you h 
principle inertias, 
you compute this 
that minimum energy state is 
so, theres a clementine mission that 
went to moon, successful 
one first ones that 
found signs potential water, 
ice kind in shadowy parts 
polar craters moon 
we going to go 
visit asteroid comet something 
along way a slight 
glitch sudden 
thrusters told to stay 
until you run fuel 
wasnt thrusters, maybe 
balanced, like theres one 
thing went on, so spun to 
a crazy momentum mission 
now, torp free still, 
probably whatever is flexing 
going in structure might still 
dissipating energy will never 
ever come to rest unless you 
external force acting system 
you need an external torque to change 
a total angle momentum, right 
so even damping in system 
that you fuel slosh, 
itll dissipate 
dissipate 
to this, thats limiting case 
lower energy that ellipsoid 
sphere dont intersect 
youre violating momentum 
youve changed 
momentum system 
we must applied an external force 
maybe srps could this stuff 
thats one thing we 
space debris tracking 
srps atmospheric drag 
im looking electrostatic drag forces, 
well, torques 
change momentum time, 
really complicates 
analysis objects 
but, this is one 
so, good 
you think this is going to stable 
this is an equilibrium spin 
that means, if i put body in this 
condition omega , 
if you go back to look 
differential equations, you end 
getting is omega data zero 
omega data zero, omega data zero 
right, lets actually look at, 
let go back a few 
here we go 
if omega omega , 
while times , thats 
times something is , something 
times is , torques 
you see a pure spin b 
is going to in equilibrium, 
omegas , right 
so good 
so we found that 
we want to know, 
is this going to a stable equilibrium 
so if i take this object, 
i a pure spin this, im never 
going to physically give a pure spin 
im that good 
right 
im always a smidgen 
so, stability is always well 
this particular spin rate would perfect 
to give you zero rates in everything 
if youre a little bit, 
you going to stay close 
is that going to drive upside 
gravity gradient is easy example, 
right 
here, like this kind a pendulum 
would stable, if i this, 
anyhow, keeps wobbling, 
friction, 
keeps wobbling here to 
stay close versus this one 
this is in equilibrium 
if i wouldnt hold tight im 
a little bit, drives away 
thats an unstable one, right 
here, if we neighboring motion, 
we cant make energy smaller, 
we wouldnt intercept 
so we make energy slightly bigger, 
happens to interception curves 
stay tight 
bounded around that equilibrium 
louis 
yes, everything looks rounded 
so, if you make a little bit bigger, 
you would think, okay, 
youve got this little 
bit a curve there 
okay, youre wobbling 
if youre a fierce spin, 
you would wobble 
we see that, right 
if you take this object 
i take here spin it, 
that spun pretty well, biggie 
lets see so ive got videos here 
inertias, im showing an object 
that kind scales inertias 
im giving a sphere spin, 
would in equilibrium 
i never see wobble 
axis, that pure b spin 
here im giving slight 
offsets half a degree, 
you see, look almost identical 
perfectly identical 
stay, 
little wobbles stay small 
bounded life behaves well,right 
kind makes sense 
deviations a minimum 
energy states 
youve often learned in physics, 
nature loves minimum energy 
everything kind converges 
to minimum energy state 
right, thats stable 
one that we would 
so, thats this spin 
if we look intermediate energy, 
we increase energy, right 
everything scales evenly, a sudden, 
intermediate access is 
along b intercepts you would 
a pure spin this point, 
a pure spin 
that means object 
spinning this axis in a positive 
negative set 
two options if you 
this specific energy state 
before, you said h 
h equal to 
then, you quickly solve that 
intermediate energy state is momentum 
squared times 
intermediate inertia 
if you that energy state, 
two points you could spinning 
intersection 
line isnt points, 
like minimum energy state 
theres also this whole 
curve that happens, 
a saddle point that 
wraps around 
that is a physical motion well, 
thats called separatrix motion 
so if youre spinning nearly it, 
now, if i a pure spin here, im good 
that give a spin, 
is that one going to stable 
if youre slightly, if youre 
this point, we increase energy 
a sudden youre 
a point slightly here 
you going to stay close, 
things 
you think 
no, right 
so this curve actually takes you 
here, back here 
here comes in, so question is if 
youre this curve, well, wait a minute 
if i hit this point, i go this way 
that way, happens 
answer is you never hit that point 
spin conditions, you put 
mathematically perfectly 
if youre separatrix motion, 
you will get there 
infinite amount time 
an asymptote, right 
otherwise mathematically you see you 
a decision point a sudden 
stuff go left right 
that never happens, 
you asymptotically, 
would take an infinite amount 
time to actually reach that point 
is that patient 
so if youre slightly, 
you will see interception lines 
that kind look like this 
anytime i get close to 
this interception point, 
thats i know this actually 
takes a long, long, long time 
itll hang there, 
then, eventually, 
goes back to side 
this is why, 
if you try to flip an object 
axis intermediate inertia, right 
flipped, didnt, 
there we go, flipped again, 
flipped 
in one twist im trying hard, 
immediately , , 
unstable in that sense, right 
that becomes 
kinds behaviors 
so, intermediate axis 
spins never stable 
theyre highly unstable, 
may deceiving 
may look stable 
a short period time 
so, lets see if i 
get this video to work 
went commercial 
lets see if youtube is going to this 
this is space station, 
an object, took spun 
is this motion 
thats so cool laugh 
perturbed slightly goes 
definitely a spin 
theyre here, 
this is a spin axis 
inner median inertia 
theres a little bit a wobble, 
a perfect spin 
i guess astronauts arent 
that well trained, right 
laugh 
so, this is hard to do, 
you see 
short periods time, 
almost looks stable, right 
gets close 
stays close, crap 
hell breaks loose, right 
you flip upside again, 
you hang awhile 
no, youtube, thank you, 
knows going to show us 
laugh 
okay, goes back 
forth, yep, you stop 
so thats whats happening here 
you see, looks stable 
short periods time, 
getting close to here, 
hangs a while 
then, eventually, going to 
get here hang 
a while come back 
never settles one point, 
thats stable 
you may look like youre staying close 
a finite period time 
we go through, later on, 
control proof, stable mean, 
so forth 
you enter a bounded region, 
you to remain in that region forever, 
you will 
if youre off, you may stay there 
, years, you got really, 
really, really, really close 
eventually you will, you give 
enough time, you will bounce back 
will go to side 
hang a while come back 
so thats kind a really cool video, 
i like that one 
kind illustrates whats happening, 
right 
this is youre going one direction, 
floats around 
comes back here 
and, except air drag in that space 
station, really a torquefree motion 
bouncing back 
forth satisfying, this stuff 
this is actually 
leads to chaos well 
so a single rigid body, 
proof completely rigorous 
mathematic that this is a chaotic system 
if youre spinning nearly around 
a separatrix kind energy state 
a infinitesimal change 
here you spinning this way 
another one you spinning this way, 
is different orientations 
so infinite sensitivity to small 
changes is redefines chaos 
so separatrix motions is 
a chaotic type motion 
so you see kinds 
papers published 
so chaos is fun, here we look it, 
ive done a minor minor inaudible, 
degrees 
even less one revolution, 
hugely different orientations, right 
thats youre seeing 
you flip this thing 
let spin already tumbled 
so definitely unstable, 
lets see whats maximum energy state 
if you scale this ellipse 
big you can, 
you end this kind a huge 
ellipse, still to intercept 
thats going to 
polar points, b axis 
so this is a pure spin 
to axis least inertia, 
thats we define b 
that would this, 
so if i try to spin this, 
reasonably stable, 
an awkward way to spin 
little bit a tumble, 
looks stable 
again, you make , 
this term, you derive energy 
is h squared , minimum inertia 
that makes sense, 
you divide smallest inertia to 
get biggest energy state, right 
so thats maximum energy you could 
this amount momentum 
to more, you to apply 
external torques increase sphere 
you intercept points, 
is good 
now, here, if you have, 
we cant energy 
thats a maximum energy state, 
if we slightly less, nathan, 
is that motion going to stable 
unstable 
unstable 

itll go to minimum 

going to lose energy, 
going to dissipate energy 
if you dont consider energy loss, 
this really explorer , 
bad could 
really, a little dappy, 
nothing, small, right 
so without energy loss, if youre like 
this, thats exactly explorer 
doing, spinning 
skinny axis rocket 
got going, 
you would wobbling here 
this looks perfectly stable, 
soon you count energy loss, 
you know this ellipse 
to get smaller smaller 
point, 
youre going to go separatrix 
that point, knows happens, 
you might end upside down, 
right side 
impossible to predict, 
a chaotic thing, right 
and, then, end, energy loss, 
will we converge to 
inaudible 
yeah, this ellipse will go smaller 
smaller smaller 
smallest one would 
motions here 
so, in end, everything in nature 
rigid body converges to a flat spin 
so you 
space situational awareness, 
tracking debris objects so forth, 
this is things would converge 
assuming null external torques, right 
so you include srp, 
a recent graduate we this a lot 
looking statics 
joes work, 
things go quite 
different a sudden 
you need an external influence 
to pump momentum energy level, 
takes you 
things get way complicated, 
much, much harder to track 
if is torque free, 
classic results 
good, heres an example, 
theres energy dissipation here 
so this one, yes, 
a slight difference 
you see a little 
bit pronounced, 
overall, 
nothing like intermediate axis one 
that one really went hog wild 
went place 
so three, 
you look infinite inaudible, 
thats im looking here 
so minimum energy would here, 
maximum energy would here 
separatrix energies is here, 
you see arrows go 
so if you look h, omega , , 
coordinates spaces, 
you actually quickly tell 
actually, wobbling 
an axis maximum inertia 
im wobbling around 
in a positive sense 
if i omegas 
hs move around this axis, 
you see thats actually 
orbiting in a negative 
so this is a positive sense, 
this is a negative sense 
i know i spinning an axis 
least inertia, near to 
if flipping back 
forth closer to separatrix, 
crazy stuff 
you look 
interceptions, 
this kind gives you a quick geometric 
way to interpret stability rigid bodies 
we dual spinner, 
well a complete mathematical 
way to talk stabilities 
well rediscover results, 
a a linearization 
approach that works
