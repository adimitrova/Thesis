1
00:00:06,543 --> 00:00:07,100
Quick questions.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,530
What kind of shape do I have if my
interception curves look like this?

3
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,111
>> Symmetric.
>> Is it axisymmetric?

4
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,666
I know, you took it in 3200.

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,709
You've seen this one.

6
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,167
But why is it axisymmetric?

7
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:31,405
>> The energy ellipsoid is the same
width in one and two axis?

8
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:35,453
>> The interception
lines have constant H3.

9
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,578
If you go back and
look at the differential equations here,

10
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:42,381
H3 that means omega three is constant,

11
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:46,850
this will go to omega three dot
goes to zero if I2 is equal to I1.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,804
And then you can have a constant H3,
right?

13
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,930
That's the intersection point
that you're going to have, and

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,670
we're spinning this way.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,154
If you're here though, that means that my
omega three, my H3 coordinate is zero,

16
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:01,502
therefore omega three coordinate is zero.

17
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:02,756
If omega three is zero,

18
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:06,340
then this one is already zero to
begin with because of the inertias.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,121
If omega three is zero these, omega threes
make both of those terms go to zero.

20
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,130
That's why you get points.

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,274
Those are now pure spin conditions
that you would have and

22
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,699
they don't wobble beyond that.

23
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:21,340
What kind of shape is this going to be?

24
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,253
So basically, it says whatever spin axis
I pick, it's just going to stay there.

25
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,270
>> Sphere.
>> Sphere.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,161
>> A sphere, good.

27
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:33,864
With a sphere, you can take a sphere and
spin it about any axis and

28
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:36,340
it'll just keep spinning.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,497
And that is a pure spin.

30
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,160
So, the sphere is an easy one.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,727
No matter how bad you are,
you're spinning about a principal axis, or

32
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,044
it wouldn't be a sphere.

33
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,850
Is there another shape you could use?

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,774
The cube.

35
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:55,454
All you need is your principal inertias
have to be equal, and for a cube,

36
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:57,440
that's the case.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,444
We don't have a spherical
mass distribution, but

38
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,477
we still get three equal.

39
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,450
That's why it's easy,
actually, to throw a cube.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,654
A cube should be random, in that case.

41
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:09,100
So if you go to Vegas and throw the dice,
it should give you some random stuff.

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,587
Every throw should have
an equal probability,

43
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,780
unless you're playing with
a professional gambler, in which case,

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,055
they put a slight mass in there, right?

45
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,170
And bias it in one direction.

46
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,250
And all this kind of is no longer true,
because we no longer have equal inertias.

47
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,597
That's how gamblers today,
they're very smart with the math.

48
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:24,845
I'm sure you did it this way,
not just testing that.

49
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,753
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

50
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,295
>> But the cube is one of the things,

51
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:27,940
exactly.

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,152
Spheres people often think about it,
but the cubes,

53
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:31,785
cubes ask these kind of things as well.

54
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,458
If you want to spin them about any axis,
actually you can spin them,

55
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,730
as long as it's a perfect
mass distribution.

56
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,178
While we build cube sized spacecraft, the
internals aren't necessarily homogeneous,

57
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:46,350
so even with a cube outer shape,
you still have to look the internal.

58
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,990
Where's the battery?

59
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,924
Where's the antenna?
Right, that could shift and

60
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,470
give you three unique inertias.

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,872
But if you fill it up with lead and
launch it, that would happen.

62
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:55,440
Okay.
