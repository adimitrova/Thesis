and
what
we
're
going
to
do
next
is
we
're
going
to
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
,
at
least
two
lectures
,
talking
about
torque
free
motion
,
because
for
spacecraft
this
is
a
pretty
common
situation
.
you
're
not
always
thrusting
.
you
're
not
always
reacting
,
because
you
're
using
lots
of
resources
,
energy
,
fuel
.
so
how
do
we
understand
torque
free
motion
.
in
fact
there
's
many
missions
that
exploit
torque
free
motions
to
spin
stabilize
or
do
all
kinds
of
stuff
.
and
then
we
'll
look
at
some
disturbances
like
gravity
gradients
,
we
'll
derive
that
from
scratch
using
very
much
the
same
kind
of
notation
.
and
dual
spinners
,
that
's
another
one
.
and
then
we
'll
jump
into
the
control
stuff
afterwards
.
okay
,
so
i
did
n't
put
that
one
off
.
let
's
talk
about
torque-free
attitude
motion
.
as
we
've
been
saying
today
,
h
dot
is
equal
to
l.
if
it
's
torque-free
the
l
just
becomes
zero
.
that
says
the
nerve
,
whatever
this
vector
is
,
h
is
just
a
vector
in
space
.
and
a
vector
has
a
magnitude
times
a
direction
.
all
we
're
saying
with
h
dot
equal
to
l
is
that
as
seen
by
an
inertial
observer
,
this
vector
is
fixed
.
so
that
means
,
what
you
just
seen
before
,
h
is
equal
to
i
omega
,
we
compute
all
this
stuff
,
we
have
i
in
the
body
frame
,
we
have
omega
in
the
body
frame
.
we
very
often
write
h
is
equal
to
something
,
something
,
something
in
the
body
frame
.
the
body
frame
components
of
h
for
torque
free
motion
are
not
zero
.
the
inertias
are
fixed
,
but
the
omegas
are
going
to
vary
,
go
back
and
forth
.
but
if
you
reconstruct
in
the
body
frame
,
this
is
what
the
vector
is
,
now
you
know
what
the
body
attitude
is
.
so
times
bn
,
right
.
you
map
it
back
into
the
end
frame
.
those
,
the
three
inertia
frame
components
have
to
be
fixed
.
and
that
's
essentially
what
we
're
doing
here
.
this
is
in
the
body
frame
.
this
is
typically
how
we
write
it
.
here
we
've
assumed
what
type
of
body
frame
to
get
this
form
.
principle
,
exactly
.
now
it
's
diagonal
.
we
'll
do
this
a
lot
for
analysis
.
we
can
always
do
this
for
anybody
.
it
just
simplifies
our
basic
stability
analysis
that
we
're
looking
at
.
so
that
we
do
that
.
then
times
some
dcm
in
whatever
coordinates
you
wish
.
some
people
that
use
something
besides
mrp
.
i
just
want
to
highlight
that
.
that
does
happen
.
so
you
get
this
and
now
you
have
to
take
the
derivative
.
this
is
only
the
n
frame
components
.
now
you
have
to
take
the
derivative
of
all
this
stuff
and
set
it
equal
to
zero
.
and
you
get
a
lot
of
theta
one
dots
and
omega
dots
and
yeah
that
has
to
be
true
but
what
do
i
do
with
this
dots
.
it
's
not
very
insightful
.
so
that
's
this
is
fundamentally
what
happens
.
so
this
is
a
good
test
if
you
're
writing
an
integrator
because
you
give
it
initial
attitude
.
give
it
a
spin
.
no
torque
.
set
the
torque
to
zero
and
that
equations
of
motion
let
it
tumble
.
let
it
spin
and
you
watch
the
attitude
history
.
and
at
every
time
step
,
if
you
compute
this
.
from
the
attitude
computed
dcn
,
map
your
momentum
coordinates
from
the
body
into
the
inertial
frame
,
you
should
have
three
coordinates
that
give
you
perfect
flat
lines
.
if
they
do
that
,
then
you
get
really
warm
fuzzy
feelings
that
your
integrator
is
working
.
it
's
not
a
guarantee
that
you
get
warm
fuzzy
feelings
something
.
there
's
always
ways
people
can
get
creative
and
screw
things
up
.
but
,
if
you
preserve
momentum
in
the
inertial
frame
that
's
a
really
good
indicator
you
're
on
the
right
track
.
it
's
good
for
numerical
checks
,
it
's
not
good
for
analysis
.
so
the
next
step
is
now
for
analytical
insight
.
how
do
we
look
at
this
stuff
.
so
really
,
the
key
component
is
we
want
to
do
everything
in
the
body
frame
.
it
helps
us
.
and
we
want
to
look
at
,
we
want
to
make
use
that
momentum
is
preserved
.
if
we
're
doing
torque
free
motion
is
there
something
else
that
preserved
as
well
.
[
cough
]
.
any
momentum
.
yes
,
spencer
,
energy
actually
.
do
you
remember
the
power
equation
t
dot
.
ended
up
being
omega
dotted
with
l
,
and
at
l0
.
that
was
one
of
the
cases
,
how
we
can
get
0
power
on
the
system
.
so
[
inaudible
]
has
to
be
preserved
as
well
.
that
's
a
result
we
'll
jump
into
next
.
so
if
you
do
everything
in
the
body
frame
,
h
was
equal
to
i
omega
.
omega
,
in
the
body
frame
is
the
classic
omega
one
b
one
,
omega
two
b
two
,
and
so
forth
.
if
you
just
take
in
the
h
vector
and
putting
it
in
body
frames
,
i
'm
just
using
h
one
,
h
two
,
h
three
.
that
's
just
my
labels
of
the
b
frame
components
of
the
h
vector
.
and
i
omega
means
h
one
must
be
i
one
omega
one
.
that
's
that
first
vector
component
of
h
,
because
i
'm
using
a
principle
frame
now
that
has
diagonalised
my
stuff
.
she
is
saying
okay
,
good
where
we
going
with
this
.
it
's
written
age
or
in
the
body
frame
.
now
instead
of
using
just
a
re-written
version
of
the
prior
slide
what
we
're
going
to
do
next
is
instead
of
saying
all
three
in
actual
vector
component
have
to
be
constant
,
nice
flat
lines
when
you
plot
them
out
,
we
're
just
going
to
focus
on
the
magnitude
.
because
the
magnitude
is
a
scalar
.
and
as
we
discussed
in
the
first
week
,
to
take
a
derivative
of
a
scalar
does
n't
have
a
framed
dependency
.
so
if
h
as
a
vector
is
constant
in
the
frame
,
that
must
mean
it
's
magnitude
has
to
be
constant
as
well
.
and
therefore
,
the
magnitude
is
something
i
can
always
compute
even
in
body
frame
components
.
so
that
's
a
nice
trick
.
we
go
,
okay
,
how
do
we
get
the
magnitude
.
well
,
we
're
going
to
get
the
magnitude
squared
by
just
dotting
h
with
itself
.
or
in
a
matrix
form
we
do
h
transpose
h.
same
math
,
gives
you
the
same
stuff
.
so
this
times
itself
just
gives
you
i
one
squared
,
omega
one
squared
,
i
two
squared
,
omega
two
squared
.
and
you
start
adding
them
up
.
and
all
of
this
has
to
give
you
a
constant
.
because
whatever
spin
you
gave
the
system
whatever
gyrations
are
going
on
these
things
have
to
add
up
.
omega
ones
twos
and
threes
can
vary
with
time
but
they
have
to
add
up
to
give
you
the
same
number
in
the
end
same
momentum
.
so
good
this
gives
me
one
equation
.
kinetic
energy
was
the
other
one
that
we
talked
about
.
if
you
look
at
kinetic
energy
that
was
one
half
omega
transpose
i
omega
,
and
if
i
is
diagonal
it
really
simplifies
very
quickly
.
and
you
end
up
with
one
half
inertia
rate
squared
for
each
of
the
principle
axis
,
that
's
it
.
but
energy
is
also
preserved
.
so
you
notice
in
these
two
equations
,
the
independent
coordinates
are
the
omegas
.
and
giving
it
an
initial
spin
,
and
i
know
the
omegas
,
my
rates
,
can
change
.
but
that
gives
me
three
degrees
of
freedom
for
the
rates
,
subject
to
two
constraints
.
momentum
magnitude
has
to
be
fixed
.
energy
has
to
be
fixed
.
so
in
the
end
jordan
,
two
constraints
,
three
degrees
of
freedom
,
how
many
degrees
of
freedom
are
you
left
with
.
one
,
right
.
so
that
means
immediately
,
once
we
have
top
free
motion
,
the
omega
time
history
has
become
down
to
a
single
curve
in
three
dimensional
space
.
it
's
a
one
b
sub
space
that
we
have
to
find
.
and
so
right
now
looking
at
this
how
do
we
intercept
this
,
and
this
,
and
predict
how
that
behaves
.
this
is
not
quite
geometrically
intuitive
.
that
's
where
the
next
stuff
comes
.
let
me
go
back
here
.
could
somebody
tell
me
.
just
replace
omega
one
,
two
and
three
with
x
,
y
and
z
as
your
three
coordinates
that
we
're
tracking
.
if
you
have
ax
squared
plus
bx
squared
plus
y
squared
plus
cz
squared
equal
to
a
constant
.
what
type
of
shape
are
you
describing
.
>
>
okay
,
not
a
circle
because
this
is
a
three
dimensional
shape
.
it
's
not
a
sphere
.
>
>
[
crosstalk
]
>
>
a
,
b
,
and
c
are
different
.
if
a
,
b
,
and
c
were
the
same
it
would
ge
a
sphere
.
so
what
is
the
shape
then
.
>
>
ellipsoid
.
>
>
it
's
an
ellipsoid
that
you
actually
,
this
is
a
classic
equation
for
the
surface
of
an
ellipsoid
.
so
that
means
,
this
is
kind
of
like
stuff
,
where
we
have
this
4d
hyper
sphere
,
that
's
hard
to
visualize
.
a
3d
surface
,
i
can
draw
,
so
we
'll
see
visualizations
of
this
.
but
this
equation
actually
means
that
your
solutions
for
omega
1
,
2
,
3
,
reside
on
this
ellipsoid
.
does
the
ellipsoid
have
a
constant
shape
,
or
does
it
change
its
shape
with
time
?
>
>
[
inaudible
]
>
>
why
?
>
>
because
its
x
,
y
,
and
z
parameters
[
inaudible
]
over
time
?
>
>
x
,
y
,
and
z
are
your
independent
coordinates
.
let
's
look
at
that
.
too
much
fire
,
okay
.
if
we
have
this
,
this
is
more
of
a
classic
way
,
you
might
see
this
ellipsoid
and
that
's
some
constant
,
right
is
this
an
ellipse
?
if
a
,
b
,
and
c
are
just
constants
is
this
an
ellipse
of
a
fixed
shape
,
or
is
this
ellipse
varying
with
size
?
>
>
fixed
shape
.
>
>
fixed
shape
,
right
?
and
so
here
we
just
have
a
lot
of
coordinates
that
.
where
people
get
quickly
confused
is
what
is
the
independent
stuff
that
we
're
looking
at
.
so
the
omegas
would
be
independent
things
,
like
x
,
y
and
z.
you
see
in
the
classic
ellipsoidal
,
wiki
notes
or
something
.
i1
,
2
and
3
,
those
are
principle
inertias
that
are
fixed
in
time
because
we
have
a
rigid
body
.
if
these
were
n't
rigid
,
these
would
not
be
fixed
things
.
and
we
'll
see
that
actually
with
dual
spinners
,
so
you
have
multiple
buttons
.
same
thing
here
,
this
also
will
make
a
squared
y.
so
that
's
x
squared
y
squared
z
squared
times
some
constant
equals
to
something
that
's
constant
.
this
is
also
an
ellipse
,
so
that
that
george
was
talking
about
right
,
that
's
the
space
we
are
actually
looking
for
.
we
have
two
constraints
,
this
is
an
ellipse
,
that
's
an
ellipse
.
this
two
has
to
be
intercepted
and
that
's
the
answer
,
and
that
's
not
very
intuitive
,
it
's
not
easy
to
intercept
two
ellipsis
to
.
so
people
came
up
with
this
other
approach
.
instead
of
treating
omega
one
,
two
,
three
,
as
the
independent
coordinates
we
're
trying
to
figure
out
what
's
happening
.
we
use
scaled
versions
of
omega
one
,
two
,
three
.
basically
you
multiply
in
times
of
principle
inertias
so
the
new
independent
coordinates
are
simply
your
body
frame
angular
momentum
vector
components
.
so
i
'm
treating
h1
,
2
,
3s
.
i
can
find
h1
,
2
,
3
time
histories
,
and
then
to
map
them
back
to
omegas
,
all
i
do
is
divide
them
by
the
principal
inertias
and
you
get
omegas
again
.
but
if
you
do
this
,
and
you
get
momentum
,
constraint
looks
like
this
,
what
type
of
geometric
shape
is
this
?
this
is
a
sphere
,
all
right
,
it
's
basically
constants
equal
to
x
square
plus
y
square
plus
z
square
.
so
this
is
definitely
a
sphere
,
that
's
easy
to
draw
,
as
you
will
see
.
and
then
the
energy
constraint
,
in
terms
of
this
,
i
will
let
you
do
this
on
your
own
.
you
just
have
to
plug
in
that
h1
is
i1
omega1
,
yeah
we
arrange
it
you
end
up
getting
the
energy
constraint
of
divided
by
t
gives
you
this
.
this
is
kind
of
a
classic
normalized
forward
where
the
ellipsoidal
form
is
something
old
square
equal
to
one
.
and
then
this
these
terms
if
you
go
look
up
ellipsoids
which
you
could
do
easily
.
these
become
related
to
your
semi-minor
,
semi-intermediate
,
and
semi-major
axes
of
that
ellipsoid
that
you
're
going
to
have
,
right
?
this
is
just
a
unit
,
not
a
unit
sphere
.
it
's
a
sphere
of
size
h
,
and
then
you
get
these
energies
that
come
in
there
,
and
this
is
something
we
can
start
to
put
together
.
so
for
torque-free
motion
,
to
consider
what
happens
to
the
rates
over
time
as
you
're
jumbling
and
tirading
for
anybody
,
this
is
nothing
cylindrical
or
symmetric
,
it
's
any
inertias
.
these
are
the
two
constraints
,
we
've
moved
from
omega
space
to
h
space
,
and
that
gave
us
a
simpler
way
to
geometrically
find
these
things
.
so
that
's
a
sphere
,
and
this
is
the
classic
ellipsoidal
equations
,
that
you
can
find
your
a
,
bs
and
cs
.
which
are
you
're
semi-axes
for
the
three
things
,
so
yep
,
that
's
what
you
can
find
there
.
so
we
'll
have
three
,
if
we
have
three
distinct
inertias
,
you
will
have
three
distinct
axis
,
and
a
key
element
again
is
well
let
's
see
,
can
t
vary
on
a
spacecraft
?
i
'm
full
of
simple
questions
this
morning
.
torque-free
motion
,
there
's
no
external
torque
acting
on
a
spacecraft
,
could
t
vary
,
ansel
?
>
>
yeah
.
>
>
could
h
vary
?
if
it
's
torque-free
,
no
external
force
acting
on
the
spacecraft
?
you
do
n't
think
so
,
you
guessing
,
you
feeling
lucky
?
>
>
h
=
l
,
it
goes
back
to
that
.
is
that
good
for
a
rigid
body
?
yes
,
is
it
good
for
a
continuum
?
yeah
,
so
if
you
have
the
spacecraft
it
's
not
rigid
,
it
has
fuel
slosh
.
it
has
people
wandering
around
in
there
,
it
's
a
space
station
.
it
has
big
panels
that
can
flex
,
space
station
again
,
huge
panels
right
?
h
dot
equal
to
l
still
holds
,
if
there
's
no
external
torque
acting
on
the
system
,
h
has
to
be
preserved
.
so
for
all
the
torque-free
motions
,
we
always
treat
h
as
a
constant
.
that
's
religion
,
i
mean
,
it
does
n't
change
,
t
,
though
,
the
energy
.
we
say
this
is
rigid
,
but
how
rigid
is
any
structure
,
everything
has
a
little
bit
of
flex
.
there
's
always
something
,
maybe
very
stiff
,
but
there
is
always
some
amount
of
flexing
.
so
as
soon
as
you
flex
,
what
happens
mechanically
?
what
happens
to
your
energy
state
?
yeah
,
you
're
going
to
start
dissipating
energy
.
there
's
always
a
resistance
to
flexing
and
there
's
some
damping
coefficient
.
it
might
be
really
,
really
small
but
if
internal
friction
there
's
stuff
rubbing
against
ach
other
there
.
there
's
walls
,
there
's
always
friction
ways
to
dissipate
energy
,
so
even
though
it
might
be
almost
rigid
and
you
now
nothing
is
truly
rigid
.
so
in
practice
in
this
math
we
are
assuming
right
now
it
's
perfectly
rigid
but
that
's
an
artefact
of
our
mathematics
.
in
real
life
as
an
engineer
we
realize
nothing
is
perfectly
rigid
,
in
fact
what
was
the
first
satellite
that
went
up
for
the
u.s.
?
>
>
explorer
1
.
>
>
explorer
.
how
did
explorer
1
do
?
it
was
kind
of
in
this
shape
,
they
go
hey
,
we
looked
at
this
equations
and
if
we
spin
about
this
axis
.
i
heard
spinning
stabilizes
things
,
so
they
spun
about
this
axis
right
?
had
big
antenna
sticking
out
,
that
's
how
they
communicated
.
those
antenna
were
all
flopping
,
doing
stuff
,
anybody
remember
how
long
before
it
went
unstable
?
it
was
less
than
an
orbit
,
bery
glorious
.
after
that
they
started
to
listen
to
astrodynamicist
they
go
to
help
if
you
do
it
by
the
right
axis
and
the
right
stuff
,
and
all
right
?
so
that
was
one
because
it
is
flexing
it
definitely
lost
energy
and
you
will
see
here
shortly
why
with
all
these
constraints
.
this
leads
to
something
that
can
be
very
unstable
,
actually
,
and
what
does
it
move
towards
?
there
's
definite
stable
equilibrium
,
but
it
's
not
this
spin
,
where
you
're
spinning
about
this
nice
symmetry
axis
,
the
skinny
one
,
right
?
so
energy
can
vary
,
that
means
,
momentum
does
n't
,
if
it
's
torque-free
,
our
momentum
sphere
is
locked
.
but
for
that
amount
of
momentum
there
is
a
finite
range
of
energies
that
you
can
have
,
this
ellipsoid
has
to
intercept
with
momentum
.
so
there
's
a
minimum
energy
state
you
can
have
,
and
there
's
a
maximum
energy
state
you
can
have
.
so
just
because
you
have
a
fixed
amount
of
momentum
you
can
not
predict
what
the
actual
energy
state
is
.
there
's
a
range
of
energies
you
can
have
as
we
dissipate
energy
we
go
from
one
to
another
on
our
own
.
what
happens
though
as
we
change
energy
,
you
can
see
it
's
2x
the
principle
inertia
x
the
energy
it
takes
square
root
.
as
energy
scales
,
it
's
going
to
scale
all
of
my
axes
simultaneously
.
so
this
ellipsoid
,
basically
,
grows
homogeneously
or
shrinks
homogeneously
with
energy
.
as
you
change
energy
,
you
do
n't
just
make
this
ellipsoid
longer
in
one
direction
and
skinnier
in
another
.
it
just
grows
and
scales
evenly
.
right
?
that
's
the
key
thing
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
equation
.
good
,
now
,
let
's
look
at
this
.
this
is
my
first
of
many
figures
.
we
're
going
to
assume
,
without
loss
in
generality
,
that
our
principal
in
our
body
frame
,
the
principal
frame
,
it
's
lined
up
such
that
b1
gives
axis
of
maximum
inertia
.
that
would
be
like
kind
of
like
this
axis
here
on
this
box
.
then
you
have
b2
is
axis
of
intermediate
inertia
.
that
's
the
one
in-between
.
that
would
be
this
kind
of
a
skinnier
side
.
and
then
axis
of
least
inertia
is
here
.
as
we
said
principal
frames
is
to
find
that
permutation
.
i
can
always
choose
a
frame
where
this
is
true
.
so
,
i
do
n't
have
to
do
this
math
six
different
ways
.
i
can
just
do
it
once
.
and
you
can
flip
your
frames
when
if
needed
.
and
now
we
're
plotting
these
things
in
momentum
corner
space
.
not
omega
space
but
we
realize
that
omega
2
omega
h
,
sorry
h3
h2
are
just
omega
1
times
i1
and
so
forth
.
the
momentum
shows
up
as
a
sphere
,
that
's
nice
.
the
ellipsoid
shows
up
here
,
and
it
has
to
intercept
.
so
,
we
said
earlier
we
've
got
three
coordinates
we
're
looking
for
,
omega
1
,
2
,
3
,
subject
to
two
constraints
.
the
answer
must
be
a
curve
.
and
that
's
where
our
curve
is
.
is
that
the
only
intersection
?
>
>
there
's
one
i
'm
not
showing
.
it
's
on
the
backside
.
thank
you
.
>
>
[
laugh
]
>
>
so
,
even
here
,
so
if
you
have
energy
specified
and
momentum
specified
,
there
's
actually
two
possible
trajectories
you
could
be
on
.
they
're
related
.
they
're
kind
of
mirror
images
.
but
the
shape
is
n't
flat
,
this
is
kind
of
potato-shaped
.
things
,
ellipsoid
,
but
wrapped
around
a
sphere
,
that
's
what
the
intersection
curve
looks
like
.
and
that
's
what
you
would
have
.
and
here
you
would
wobble
around
in
this
direction
,
over
there
it
's
in
this
direction
.
so
,
this
gives
you
something
,
this
scale
body
inertia
,
you
can
tell
right
away
,
this
is
where
my
omegas
have
to
reside
.
this
can
also
be
used
as
an
integration
check
.
so
now
we
can
play
with
energy
levels
and
start
to
look
at
different
spin
conditions
and
also
talk
about
stability
of
these
.
so
,
i
know
,
those
of
you
taking
3200
,
you
've
seen
these
slides
before
.
so
,
then
we
'll
quickly
go
to
new
stuff
.
with
h
,
let
's
look
at
the
smallest
ellipse
you
can
do
.
if
you
shrink
your
energy
then
remember
these
axes
are
proportional
to
the
principal
inertias
so
this
axis
b1
that
has
the
largest
principal
inertia
.
it
's
the
longest
elongation
.
if
you
shrink
the
ellipsis
small
as
you
can
make
it
,
the
longest
elongation
is
going
to
be
the
only
point
that
just
barely
touches
the
momentum
sphere
.
that
's
kind
of
the
geometric
interpretation
.
so
that
means
,
what
kind
of
spin
do
you
have
?
that
's
a
single
intersection
point
here
or
here
.
so
that
means
,
in
this
case
,
you
have
a
spin
that
's
doing
either
you
're
rotating
positive
or
negative
about
your
b1
axis
,
but
you
're
doing
a
pure
spin
about
a
principle
axis
.
and
so
in
this
case
here
,
actually
it
would
wobble
and
you
'd
be
spinning
this
case
that
way
.
so
h2
and
3
are
0
because
you
only
have
an
h1
axis
intercept
,
that
's
there
.
and
you
plug
it
back
into
the
equations
,
in
the
kinetic
equations
.
and
in
the
end
,
if
you
have
h
and
the
principle
inertias
,
you
can
compute
with
this
what
that
minimum
energy
state
is
.
so
,
there
's
a
clementine
mission
that
went
to
the
moon
,
very
successful
.
it
was
one
of
the
first
ones
that
found
signs
of
potential
water
,
ice
kind
of
in
the
shadowy
parts
of
the
polar
craters
of
the
moon
.
then
after
we
was
going
to
go
off
and
visit
some
asteroid
or
comet
or
something
.
and
along
the
way
they
had
a
slight
glitch
where
all
of
the
sudden
the
thrusters
were
told
to
be
on
and
stay
on
just
because
until
you
run
out
of
fuel
.
it
was
n't
just
all
the
thrusters
,
maybe
it
was
balanced
,
it
was
more
like
there
's
one
thing
went
on
,
and
so
it
spun
up
to
a
crazy
momentum
and
the
mission
was
over
.
now
,
it
's
torp
free
it
's
still
,
probably
whatever
is
flexing
going
on
in
the
structure
might
still
be
dissipating
energy
but
it
will
never
ever
come
to
rest
unless
you
have
some
external
force
acting
on
the
system
.
you
need
an
external
torque
to
change
a
total
angle
momentum
,
all
right
.
so
even
with
damping
in
the
system
that
you
have
fuel
slosh
,
it
'll
dissipate
it
but
it
can
only
dissipate
it
down
.
to
this
,
that
's
the
limiting
case
.
any
lower
energy
that
ellipsoid
and
the
sphere
do
n't
intersect
.
you
're
violating
momentum
.
now
you
've
changed
momentum
of
the
system
and
we
must
have
applied
an
external
force
.
maybe
srps
could
do
some
of
this
stuff
.
that
's
one
thing
we
do
with
space
debris
tracking
.
srps
atmospheric
drag
.
i
'm
looking
at
electrostatic
drag
forces
,
as
well
,
and
torques
.
they
can
change
momentum
over
time
,
which
really
complicates
the
analysis
of
the
objects
.
but
,
this
is
one
of
them
.
so
,
good
.
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
be
stable
?
this
is
an
equilibrium
spin
.
that
means
,
if
i
put
my
body
in
this
condition
my
omega
2
,
and
3
are
0.
if
you
go
back
to
look
at
the
other
differential
equations
,
what
you
end
up
getting
is
omega
1
data
zero
or
omega
2
data
zero
,
or
omega
3
data
zero
.
all
right
,
let
's
actually
look
at
,
let
me
just
go
back
a
few
.
here
we
go
.
if
omega
2
and
omega
3
are
0
,
while
2
times
3
,
that
's
all
0
.
0
times
something
is
0
,
something
times
0
is
0
,
and
torques
are
all
0.
you
can
see
a
pure
spin
about
b1
is
going
to
be
in
equilibrium
,
where
all
the
omegas
are
0
,
right
?
so
good
.
so
we
found
that
.
now
we
want
to
know
,
is
this
going
to
be
a
stable
equilibrium
.
so
if
i
take
this
object
,
and
i
do
a
pure
spin
about
this
,
i
'm
never
going
to
physically
give
it
a
pure
spin
.
i
'm
just
not
that
good
.
all
right
?
i
'm
always
off
by
a
smidgen
.
so
,
stability
is
always
well
.
this
particular
spin
rate
would
be
perfect
to
give
you
zero
rates
in
everything
.
but
if
you
're
off
by
a
little
bit
,
are
you
going
to
stay
close
?
or
is
that
going
to
drive
it
upside
down
?
gravity
gradient
is
the
easy
example
,
right
?
here
,
like
this
kind
of
a
pendulum
would
be
stable
,
if
i
do
this
,
anyhow
,
it
keeps
wobbling
,
then
have
friction
,
it
just
keeps
wobbling
here
to
stay
close
versus
this
one
.
this
is
in
equilibrium
.
but
if
i
would
n't
hold
it
tight
and
i
'm
off
by
a
little
bit
,
it
drives
it
away
.
that
's
an
unstable
one
,
all
right
?
here
,
if
we
have
neighboring
motion
,
we
ca
n't
make
energy
any
smaller
,
we
would
n't
intercept
.
so
we
just
make
energy
slightly
bigger
,
what
happens
to
the
interception
curves
?
do
they
stay
tight
and
bounded
around
that
equilibrium
?
louis
?
yes
,
everything
looks
rounded
.
>
>
so
,
if
you
make
it
a
little
bit
bigger
,
you
would
think
,
okay
,
you
've
got
this
little
bit
of
a
curve
there
.
okay
,
you
're
wobbling
some
.
if
you
're
not
doing
a
fierce
spin
,
you
would
wobble
some
.
and
we
see
that
,
right
?
if
you
take
this
object
and
i
take
it
here
and
spin
it
,
that
spun
pretty
well
,
no
biggie
.
let
's
see
so
i
've
got
some
videos
here
.
same
inertias
,
i
'm
showing
an
object
that
kind
of
scales
with
these
inertias
.
i
'm
giving
it
a
sphere
spin
,
which
would
be
in
equilibrium
.
i
should
never
see
it
wobble
by
other
axis
,
it
's
just
doing
that
pure
b1
spin
.
here
i
'm
giving
it
some
slight
offsets
with
half
a
degree
,
and
you
can
see
,
they
look
almost
identical
.
they
are
not
perfectly
identical
but
they
stay
,
these
little
wobbles
they
stay
very
small
and
bounded
and
life
behaves
well
,
right
?
which
kind
of
makes
sense
because
we
're
doing
deviations
about
a
minimum
energy
states
.
and
as
you
've
often
learned
in
physics
,
nature
loves
minimum
energy
.
everything
kind
of
converges
to
minimum
energy
state
.
right
,
that
's
the
stable
one
that
we
would
have
.
so
,
that
's
this
spin
.
if
we
now
look
at
intermediate
energy
,
we
increase
our
energy
,
right
?
everything
scales
evenly
,
now
of
a
sudden
,
the
intermediate
access
which
is
along
b2
intercepts
you
would
have
a
pure
spin
about
this
point
,
or
a
pure
spin
about
the
other
.
that
means
when
these
object
were
spinning
about
this
axis
in
a
positive
or
negative
set
.
those
are
the
two
options
if
you
have
this
specific
energy
state
.
and
as
before
,
you
said
h1
and
h3
equal
to
0.
and
then
,
you
can
quickly
solve
that
intermediate
energy
state
is
momentum
squared
over
2
times
the
intermediate
inertia
.
if
you
have
that
energy
state
,
these
are
the
two
points
you
could
be
spinning
.
but
it
's
not
the
intersection
line
is
n't
just
2
points
,
like
with
the
minimum
energy
state
.
there
's
also
this
whole
curve
that
happens
,
it
's
a
saddle
point
that
wraps
around
itself
.
that
is
a
physical
motion
as
well
,
and
that
's
called
the
separatrix
motion
.
so
if
you
're
spinning
nearly
about
it
,
now
,
if
i
do
a
pure
spin
here
,
i
'm
good
.
that
should
give
me
just
a
spin
,
but
is
that
one
going
to
be
stable
?
if
you
're
off
slightly
,
if
you
're
not
just
on
this
point
,
but
we
increase
energy
.
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
're
at
a
point
slightly
above
it
up
here
.
are
you
going
to
stay
close
,
with
these
things
?
what
do
you
think
?
no
,
right
?
so
this
curve
actually
takes
you
from
here
,
then
back
over
here
.
here
it
comes
in
,
so
the
question
is
if
you
're
on
this
curve
,
well
,
wait
a
minute
.
if
i
hit
this
point
,
do
i
go
this
way
or
that
way
,
what
happens
?
the
answer
is
you
never
hit
that
point
.
those
spin
conditions
,
you
can
put
yourself
on
it
mathematically
perfectly
.
but
if
you
're
on
the
separatrix
motion
,
you
will
get
there
with
infinite
amount
of
time
.
it
's
an
asymptote
,
right
?
otherwise
mathematically
you
can
see
you
have
a
decision
point
all
of
a
sudden
does
the
stuff
go
left
or
right
?
and
that
never
happens
,
because
you
just
asymptotically
,
it
would
take
an
infinite
amount
of
time
to
actually
reach
that
point
.
and
who
is
that
patient
?
so
if
you
're
off
slightly
,
you
will
see
interception
lines
that
kind
of
look
like
this
.
but
anytime
i
get
close
to
this
interception
point
,
that
's
when
i
know
this
actually
takes
a
long
,
long
,
long
time
.
it
'll
hang
out
there
,
and
then
,
eventually
,
it
goes
back
over
to
the
other
side
.
this
is
why
,
if
you
try
to
flip
an
object
about
the
axis
of
intermediate
inertia
,
right
?
it
flipped
,
and
now
it
did
n't
,
there
we
go
,
it
flipped
again
,
and
it
flipped
again
.
in
one
twist
and
i
'm
not
trying
hard
,
it
immediately
does
180
,
180
,
180.
it
's
very
unstable
in
that
sense
,
right
?
that
becomes
because
of
these
kinds
of
behaviors
.
so
,
intermediate
axis
spins
are
never
stable
.
they
're
highly
unstable
,
but
they
may
be
deceiving
.
they
may
look
stable
for
a
short
period
of
time
.
so
,
let
's
see
if
i
can
get
this
video
to
work
.
went
through
the
commercial
.
let
's
see
if
youtube
is
going
to
do
this
.
this
is
on
the
space
station
,
they
have
an
object
,
they
took
it
and
they
spun
it
.
why
is
it
doing
this
motion
?
>
>
that
's
so
cool
[
laugh
]
.
it
's
perturbed
very
slightly
and
goes
on
.
>
>
it
's
definitely
a
spin
as
they
're
doing
it
here
,
this
is
a
spin
about
the
axis
of
inner
median
inertia
.
but
there
's
a
little
bit
of
a
wobble
,
it
's
not
a
perfect
spin
.
i
guess
astronauts
are
n't
that
well
trained
,
all
right
?
>
>
[
laugh
]
>
>
so
,
this
is
hard
to
do
,
but
you
can
see
.
for
short
periods
of
time
,
it
almost
looks
stable
,
right
?
it
gets
close
and
it
stays
close
,
then
crap
.
all
hell
breaks
loose
,
right
?
and
you
flip
upside
down
again
,
and
then
you
hang
out
for
awhile
.
no
,
youtube
,
thank
you
,
who
knows
what
it
's
going
to
show
us
.
>
>
[
laugh
]
>
>
okay
,
but
it
goes
back
and
forth
,
yep
,
you
can
stop
.
so
that
's
what
's
happening
here
.
you
can
see
,
it
looks
stable
for
short
periods
of
time
,
but
it
's
getting
close
to
here
,
hangs
out
for
a
while
.
but
then
,
eventually
,
it
's
going
to
get
over
here
and
then
hang
out
for
a
while
and
then
come
back
.
it
never
settles
at
one
point
,
that
's
why
it
's
not
stable
.
you
may
look
like
you
're
staying
close
for
a
finite
period
of
time
.
but
as
we
go
through
,
later
on
,
the
control
proof
,
or
the
stable
mean
,
and
so
forth
.
once
you
enter
a
bounded
region
,
you
have
to
remain
in
that
region
forever
,
and
you
will
not
.
because
if
you
're
off
,
you
may
stay
there
for
10,000
years
,
because
you
got
really
,
really
,
really
,
really
close
.
but
eventually
you
will
,
you
give
it
enough
time
,
you
will
bounce
back
.
and
it
will
go
off
to
the
other
side
.
hang
out
for
a
while
and
then
come
back
.
so
that
's
kind
of
a
really
cool
video
,
i
like
that
one
.
it
kind
of
illustrates
what
's
happening
,
right
?
this
is
where
you
're
going
one
direction
,
and
then
it
floats
around
and
comes
back
here
.
and
,
except
for
the
air
drag
in
that
space
station
,
it
's
really
a
torque-free
motion
.
and
it
's
just
bouncing
back
and
forth
satisfying
,
this
stuff
.
this
is
actually
what
leads
to
chaos
as
well
.
so
with
a
single
rigid
body
,
he
can
proof
completely
rigorous
mathematic
that
this
is
a
chaotic
system
.
if
you
're
spinning
nearly
around
a
separatrix
kind
of
energy
state
.
because
a
infinitesimal
change
here
has
you
spinning
this
way
.
and
another
one
has
you
spinning
this
way
,
which
is
different
orientations
.
and
so
infinite
sensitivity
to
small
changes
is
what
redefines
chaos
.
and
so
separatrix
motions
is
a
chaotic
type
of
motion
.
so
you
see
all
kinds
of
papers
published
on
it
.
so
chaos
is
fun
,
here
we
look
at
it
,
i
've
just
done
a
minor
minor
[
inaudible
]
,
again
0.5
degrees
.
and
even
after
less
than
one
revolution
,
hugely
different
orientations
,
right
?
that
's
what
you
're
seeing
when
you
flip
this
thing
and
let
it
spin
and
its
already
tumbled
.
so
definitely
unstable
,
let
's
see
what
's
the
maximum
energy
state
.
if
you
scale
this
ellipse
as
big
as
you
can
,
you
end
up
with
this
kind
of
a
huge
ellipse
,
it
still
has
to
intercept
.
and
that
's
going
to
be
now
at
the
polar
points
,
the
b3
axis
.
so
this
is
a
pure
spin
about
to
axis
of
least
inertia
,
because
that
's
how
we
define
b3
.
and
that
would
be
this
,
and
so
if
i
try
to
spin
this
,
it
's
reasonably
stable
,
it
's
just
an
awkward
way
to
spin
it
.
little
bit
of
a
tumble
,
but
it
looks
stable
.
again
,
you
make
your
other
other
2
,
0.
now
from
this
term
,
you
can
derive
energy
is
h
squared
over
2
,
minimum
inertia
.
that
makes
sense
,
you
divide
by
the
smallest
inertia
to
get
the
biggest
energy
state
,
right
?
so
that
's
the
maximum
energy
you
could
have
with
this
amount
of
momentum
.
to
have
any
more
,
you
have
to
apply
external
torques
and
increase
your
sphere
.
but
you
intercept
at
2
points
,
which
is
good
.
now
,
here
,
if
you
have
,
we
ca
n't
have
more
energy
.
that
's
a
maximum
energy
state
,
if
we
have
slightly
less
,
nathan
,
is
that
motion
going
to
be
stable
or
unstable
?
>
>
unstable
.
>
>
why
?
>
>
because
it
'll
go
to
the
minimum
.
>
>
why
?
>
>
because
it
's
going
to
lose
some
energy
,
it
's
going
to
dissipate
some
energy
.
>
>
if
you
do
n't
consider
energy
loss
,
and
this
was
really
explorer
1
,
how
bad
could
it
be
?
really
,
it
's
just
a
little
dappy
,
nothing
,
it
's
very
small
,
right
?
so
without
energy
loss
,
if
you
're
like
this
,
that
's
exactly
what
explorer
1
was
doing
,
spinning
about
the
skinny
axis
of
the
rocket
.
they
just
got
it
going
,
you
would
just
be
wobbling
here
.
this
looks
perfectly
stable
,
but
as
soon
as
you
count
the
energy
loss
,
you
know
this
ellipse
has
to
get
smaller
and
smaller
.
and
at
some
point
,
you
're
going
to
go
through
the
separatrix
.
at
that
point
,
who
knows
what
happens
,
and
you
might
end
up
upside
down
,
right
side
up
.
it
's
impossible
to
predict
,
it
's
a
chaotic
thing
,
right
?
and
,
then
,
at
the
end
,
with
energy
loss
,
where
will
we
converge
to
?
>
>
[
inaudible
]
>
>
yeah
,
this
ellipse
will
go
smaller
and
smaller
and
smaller
.
and
the
smallest
one
would
be
the
motions
here
.
so
,
in
the
end
,
everything
in
nature
with
rigid
body
converges
to
a
flat
spin
.
so
for
those
of
you
doing
space
situational
awareness
,
tracking
debris
objects
and
so
forth
,
this
is
where
things
would
converge
assuming
null
external
torques
,
right
?
so
once
you
include
srp
,
and
as
a
recent
graduate
we
did
this
a
lot
.
we
're
looking
at
the
statics
with
joe
's
work
,
things
can
go
quite
different
all
of
a
sudden
.
because
now
you
need
an
external
influence
to
pump
up
momentum
and
energy
level
,
and
it
takes
you
out
again
.
and
things
get
way
more
complicated
,
much
,
much
harder
to
track
.
but
if
it
is
torque
free
,
these
are
the
classic
results
.
good
,
and
here
's
an
example
,
there
's
no
energy
dissipation
here
.
so
this
one
,
yes
,
it
has
a
slight
difference
.
you
can
see
it
a
little
bit
more
pronounced
,
but
overall
,
nothing
like
the
intermediate
axis
one
.
that
one
really
went
hog
wild
and
went
all
over
the
place
.
so
those
are
the
three
,
you
can
look
at
all
infinite
[
inaudible
]
,
that
's
what
i
'm
looking
at
here
.
so
minimum
energy
would
be
here
,
maximum
energy
would
be
here
.
separatrix
energies
is
here
,
and
you
can
see
the
arrows
how
they
go
.
so
if
you
look
at
your
h1
,
omega
1
,
2
,
3
coordinates
spaces
,
you
can
actually
quickly
tell
.
actually
,
we
're
wobbling
about
an
axis
of
maximum
inertia
.
because
i
'm
wobbling
around
in
a
positive
sense
.
if
i
have
my
omegas
or
hs
move
around
this
axis
,
and
you
can
see
that
's
actually
orbiting
in
a
negative
.
so
this
is
a
positive
sense
,
this
is
a
negative
sense
.
i
know
i
am
spinning
about
an
axis
of
least
inertia
,
or
near
to
it
.
and
if
it
's
flipping
back
and
forth
your
closer
to
the
separatrix
,
it
's
doing
some
crazy
stuff
.
but
you
can
look
at
all
these
interceptions
,
and
this
kind
of
gives
you
a
quick
geometric
way
to
interpret
stability
rigid
bodies
.
when
we
do
the
dual
spinner
,
we
'll
do
a
complete
mathematical
way
to
talk
about
stabilities
.
and
we
'll
rediscover
the
same
results
,
just
with
a
more
of
a
linearization
approach
on
how
that
works
.
