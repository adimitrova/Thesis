so good, analytic one, 
this is pretty straightforward 
actually, you something 
this in homeworks, well 
so if we torque free motion, 
weve assumed principal frame 
three equations you 
thing ive dropped l, 
, , theres external torque 
so this is a pure spin, you take an 
object, you spin up, happens 
in particular now, 
we want to look an axisymmetric case 
so here going to 
assume this diagonal still 
if we assume axisymmetric, 
like a cylinder, rocket bodies 
many spacecraft kind axisymmetry 
to coming launch vehicle, 
to to get atmosphere 
so is a common shape assumption 
we picked b, b to a transverse 
b is axis symmetry 
so i i to equal, 
im calling it, right 
two transverse axes 
if you that, plug in, 
last one that i minus i, 
i minus i, thats going to go to 
so immediately we an omega dot 
whatever spin you give 
axis symmetry, 
that spin rate stays a flat line 
doesnt change 
two will actually change 
function inertia 
symmetry axis 
transverse inertia, 
course, initial conditions 
so we two equations 
two unknowns 
this one falls omega dot, 
that makes omega a constant 
that means here omega is 
simply initial omega 
longer known, a known 
quantity initial conditions 
so, left omega , 
omega weve got two first 
order differential equations 
we solve this 
this is one cases youre 
trying to solve things, 
you try to get rid dots 
easiest path is to get rid 
dots is actually to add dots 
that gives you an answer 
that we find in end 
if i differentiate this equation this 
is shouldnt bold actually, unbold 
take dots 
inertia is a constant 
omega , omega a constant, so theres 
omega dot, omega could vary 
you see omega depends 
omega , if i go back a slide, 
omega dot depends omega , 
again, treating omega a constant 
so if i differentiate , i get 
an omega dot, depends omega 
you plug that in 
you end this equation, 
thats omega double dot plus 
something times omega equal to 
engineers, like yes, 
i knew thered a springmass 
system somewhere, right 
this is a typical springmass system 
you know to find answers, 
will give you typical sines 
cosine results 
so, x double dock kx you 
solve that differential equation 
thats boils to, 
an axis symmetric case 
you things omega , 
gives you kind 
a constant inertias a constant, 
omega is a constant, so this 
is nothing k in end, right 
if you a springmass analogy 
so axisymmetric cases, 
easy to 
then, i think in homework 
you this 
show that you remember to solve 
simple first order differential equations 
you plug in conditions, 
come coefficients 
this one here is called omega p 
i rewrite it, so 
to this 
whats interesting here is is i is 
example less 
thats this kind stuff 
inertia transverse this 
pen is much bigger inertia 
symmetry axis right 
so in that case this is 
a ratio less minus , 
going to give you 
omega is positive 
thats going to give you 
a negative omega p 
we saw pole hold plus 
momentum spheres 
energye lipsoids if im a spin 
near axis least inertia, 
that i axis, so 
wobbles there 
we would orbiting in a negative sense, 
that comes sine right here 
if we i axis largest 
inertia, so we a plate 
think a big, flat plate basically 
spinning, right, youre slightly 
i is actually, so oproid body, 
is bigger transverse inertia, 
this becomes , 
is still positive 
thats there we saw curves 
orbiting in a positive sense 
this is classic 
answer that you 
a rigid body, torques, 
axis symmetric 
so we make that one assumption, 
this is a classic result 
make sure you derive this 
this is pretty straightforward 
here answers 
if you integrate equations, you 
would see, using differential 
equations we talked, i omega dot plus 
omega i omega equal to , in this case 
you integrate this stuff, you would 
get curves, show you yes, 
predicted, i get a sine like curve 
face shift, a cosine in cases 
you get inaudible in omega 
thats rates 
if you attitude motion, 
this is thing 
im showing here angles 
again, people, try to diverse 
something nonmrp 
well get to a lot later 
so happens is, attitude 
motion is difficult to predict 
so torquefree motions, 
parts that easy spin 
parts this equation 
we predict spin stability, we 
dont necessarily pointing stability 
thats a whole nother thing 
well get to that 
in threeaxis control 
if you need spin stability, thats 
kinds analysis really help
