1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,901
Torque free motion.

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:10,530
Momentum has to be constant.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,212
The momentum magnitude has to be constant,

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,310
which is what I'm writing
here in the first equation.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,160
And kinetic energy has to be constant.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,200
So we're not considering actual
mechanical energy loss right now.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,016
Like, before, like the Paul will plots,
let's assume T and

8
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:24,328
H are perfectly preserved.

9
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:30,950
You can write the momentum at energy
constraints in terms of your omegas.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,680
H was I omega, so that for
the magnitude is the component squared.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,988
That's easy, magnitude squared.

12
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:40,170
And kinetic energy was 1/2, so
the 2 comes to the left-hand side.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,940
This one was just to make a transpose
I Omega, that I is a diagonal.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,500
Again, makes it very easy.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,680
This is the form that you would have.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,323
Now these are two constraints.

17
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:54,040
And we have three variables.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,893
And quickly this illustrates again,
that the omega curve that you're

19
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,702
going to get isn't going to be a plane or
a volume, the solution space.

20
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:04,950
It's going to be one dimensional curve
in three dimensional omega space, right?

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,770
That's what we're looking for.

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,500
We have three unknowns, omega one,
two and three and two constraints.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,400
So I can always use these two constraints
and that's what I'm laying out here.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,340
I say, okay well let me just pick to
write everything in terms over omega 1.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,870
Why?
because it's the first thing one that

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,080
appears.

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,089
So I can use this and
solve for omega 2 squared and

28
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:27,595
that's what you have in this equation.

29
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:32,140
And I can solve this for
omega 3 squared which comes up here.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,020
So you've got two equations and
two terms, omega one and

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,240
two that I'm solving for, so
just rule any algebra and you reduce it.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
So, now because of these constrains if I
have an omega one and I know my momentum

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,670
and I know my energy added at
the beginning, I can quickly tell you what

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,950
the magnitude squared of omega two has and
the same thing for omega three, all right?

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,090
So it's just the way of
re-writing momentum and

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,819
energy constrains
exclusively in omega terms.

37
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,627
Now what makes omega 1 special?

38
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:01,470
Nothing really.

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,086
There's nothing special about omega 1.

40
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:07,357
You could've just as easily solved
everything in terms of omega 2 or

41
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:10,598
you could've used in two equations and
say, well,

42
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,330
I'm going to solve everything for
omega 1 and 2 in terms of omega 3, right?

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,640
You can solve this any which way you wish.

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
And substitute them again.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,470
I will use all of them.

46
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,480
This was in the paper by Junkins,
Jacobson,

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,590
Blanton that you've got
a reference down here.

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,530
It's actually from 1973.

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,620
Most of you weren't even born.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,130
But it's an eloquent result here and
you will see,

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,830
this has some analogy to
the axisymmetric cases.

52
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,860
But it gives you a more general
formulation that you don't often see.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,580
So this page, all we've done is we've
taken momentum energy equations and

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,930
we've used it to express the omegas
in terms of momentum and energy and

55
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,307
one of the other omegas, that's it.

56
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:54,790
So let's go back to the original problem.

57
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,306
This is the one we're trying to solve.

58
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:59,418
We've got these differential equations.

59
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:02,415
There's no L's on the right-hand
side because there's no torque.

60
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,540
How do we solve this?

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,770
Before with axis symmetry,
one of them was 0.

62
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,070
So we could say omega 3 is fixed and
therefore we took a derivative of this,

63
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,390
substitute into the others, right?

64
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,530
And came up with nicely decoupled ones.

65
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,940
Now everything varies with time and
I can no longer do that trick directly.

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,269
But there's still similar steps.

67
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,120
We're going to start out with
the same kind of a step.

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,320
We have three fully coupled and
now non-linear differential equations,

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,970
whereas before I had two coupled
linear differential equations.

70
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,050
I'm still going to take a derivative just
because it worked so well for the axis and

71
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,910
metric let's try it here, right.

72
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,761
And you do this, and then with chain rule,
Omega is Omega 2's 3's Omega 1, everything

73
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:47,493
varies with time, and here you go, to make
a 1, 2, 3 double outs divided by inertia.

74
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,550
That's basically it.

75
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,772
So you're going okay,
great, where is this going?

76
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:54,510
So you took a derivative again.

77
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,320
Now similar as to with the axis
symmetric case, omega 1 dot for

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,950
the axis symmetric only depended on
omega 2 because omega 3 was constant.

79
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,470
Well, what we're going to do now
is we plug in the second and

80
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,540
third differential equation into here.

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,750
And rewrite this all and

82
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,460
you end up with this expression
here that you going to have.

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,190
So omega 1..,
is equal to omega 1 omega 2 squared.

84
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,436
And omega 1 omega 3 squared.

85
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:25,830
As you can see there's
still quite coupled.

86
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,594
There's still non-linear Just I went from
three non linear first order differential

87
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:32,649
equations to three non linear second
order differential equations.

88
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,366
Seems like we're going backwards,
we're not making much progress.

89
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,187
But here's the elegant thing now,
from the prior slide,

90
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:48,066
I have for example omega 2 squared
In terms of just a constant and

91
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,415
something times omega 1.

92
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,272
And the same thing for omega 3 squared.

93
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:57,098
So if you look at the second
order differential equations,

94
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,950
here is omega 1, omega 1.

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,680
I can write omega 2 squared in
terms of a constant and omega 1.

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,438
And the same thing for omega 3 squared.

97
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:10,365
So by using the momentum and
the kinetic energy constraints,

98
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:15,048
I can substitute those in and
instead of having time varying quantities,

99
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:20,860
I have everything in terms of constants of
energy and consular momentum magnitude.

100
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,270
And what you can do for one,
you can follow the same process here.

101
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,749
We use here the expressions where omega
1 and 3 are written in terms of omega 2.

102
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:33,700
And here we use the third set that writes
omega 1 and 2 in terms of omega 3, right.

103
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,430
There's three different ways we could
take two constraints and solve for

104
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,500
two to three variables.

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,540
If you do that and plug them in,
so that's the process,

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,340
those equations we found,
and you plug them in here.

107
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,810
And then you do the same thing for the
other two look what happens in the end.

108
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,110
This is omega 1,
just a bunch of constants.

109
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,750
Omega 1 times constant something
times omega 1 squared.

110
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,230
So you're going to get omega 1 term and

111
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,670
then something times omega 1 squared
will give you omega 1 cubed essentially.

112
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,829
So the final form for everyone of
these omegas, I can write it as a,

113
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,190
what's called a homogeneous
undamped Duffing equations.

114
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,235
Homogeneous just means
the right hand side is 0.

115
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,051
Undamped, there's no omega dot.

116
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,230
Just omega double dots and omegas.

117
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,090
And the Duffing equation, is this classic,
this would be a spring mass equation.

118
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,460
The Duffing equation is a spring mass with
a cubic Stiffness term added to it, so

119
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,030
like a cubic spring instead
of a linear spring.

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,706
It's a common modeling
thing to see as well.

121
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:40,366
So, all three of the omegas actually
have an equation of this form.

122
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:45,246
But you would have these As and
Bs which depend on omega 1, 2 and 3, and

123
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:49,167
you can see,
the inertias are computed differently, and

124
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:53,967
when you plug it in, energy and
momentum come in with different terms so

125
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,945
we have formulas for
the As and Bs have to be.

126
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:03,785
So this is actually very elegant
because we often see systems that are,

127
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:07,900
we end up with x double dot plus kx,
right?

128
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,480
If it's x double dot plus k equal to 0,

129
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,495
it should be trivial to talk
about linear stability, at least.

130
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,923
You've linearized the system for
small motions locally.

131
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:22,658
If k is positive, we know we'll have
a restoring force let me just draw

132
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,750
that out because we're about to mute that.

133
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,064
So if you, If I have M.

134
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,806
Forget M, we'll just do normalized.

135
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:41,340
That means x double dot = kx.

136
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,340
So if x is here, you can look
at what happens to x double dot.

137
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,170
If x is positive,
the x double dot is going to be negative.

138
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,940
And it's a linear relationship.

139
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,810
So if you're too far ahead, the force is
going to restore you back to the origin.

140
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,394
If you're too far behind,
and x is negative,

141
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,449
-k be the positive value that then
makes it positive, you can catch up.

142
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,730
This gives you the typical oscillator
equation that you'd have, but

143
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,850
it's a stable motion.

144
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,640
So that works.

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,937
But this result is typically due
to a linearization that you get.

146
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:19,417
Here have we linearized
anything when we derived this?

147
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:23,757
No, we just used full nonlinear
differential equations,

148
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:28,272
differentiated them,
substituted in energy momentum, and

149
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:34,460
you end up with three equations,
we've a first order term and a cubic term.

150
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,553
The cubic term 2, if you do structures,
you often see this cubic term.

151
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:41,190
But it's the result of an approximation.

152
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,620
Once you go beyond
the first order stiffness,

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,120
the next term people typically
include is the cubic term.

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,920
If the fractions get really big like
strain hardening on a spring or something.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,718
You get this extra stiffness that
comes in, that's the cubic term.

156
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:54,294
But again,

157
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,990
in structures, that's an approximation
of a much more complex behavior.

158
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,230
It's like the next order
term that's included.

159
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,350
Here this is a perfectly
rigorous equation.

160
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,520
So in structures,
this is often found as an approximation.

161
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,740
Here there's no approximation.

162
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,650
Is it exact thing for
tumbling general inertia, motions.

163
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,730
So good, so we want to study this now.

164
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,686
A little bit more detail.

165
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,844
We have three equations.

166
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,601
When we only had these parts,

167
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:26,060
that was the axisymmetric case
it was easy, spring mass.

168
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,440
It was a sine and
a cosine response, right?

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,027
Now here it's going to get
a little more complicated.

170
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,941
Unfortunately I don't have analytic
answers as we have with the axisymmetric

171
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:38,034
codes but there are some arguments we can
talk about like global stability of these

172
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:42,028
motions and departures that you can write
it in this form is kind of a nice thing.

173
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,720
So yeah,
then I'll lead departure from Hooke's law.

174
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,558
That's the linear part,
this is an exact differential equation.

175
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,300
So we can do this.

176
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,530
So this is actually three equations.

177
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,985
Are these three equations decoupled?

178
00:09:56,985 --> 00:10:01,100
>> [COUGH]
>> Sorry, what was your name?

179
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,970
>> Mark.
>> Mark, are they decoupled?

180
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,550
>> Yes.

181
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,809
>> Okay.
Are they independent?

182
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,040
>> Yes.

183
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,290
Well, not because of the constants.

184
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,260
>> You said it with such conviction
you almost had me convinced.

185
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,002
Why are they not independent?

186
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,840
Everybody agrees they're decoupled.

187
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,000
If you look at this each equation
has only omega 1s in there.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
And the next term only has omega 2's and
the other one has only omega 3's there's

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,680
no omega 1 times omega
3's as we had originally.

190
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,750
So we definitely made them independent.

191
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,720
Once you have all the initial conditions
and these parameters you can solve three

192
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,040
independent differential equations
numerically and get the answer.

193
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,364
But independent is something
different that means,

194
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:50,604
lets say I have a spin
about omega 1 only and

195
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:56,569
the next simulation is a spin about omega
1 and tumble about B2 or something.

196
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,187
It is the same omega 1 but
it has a different B2.

197
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:04,521
What will be different in
these differential equations?

198
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:09,385
because you're right,
they aren't independent, Matt?

199
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,720
>> They are energy momentum terms?

200
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,579
>> Exactly.

201
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,971
The energy momentums are actually
what cross couples them, so

202
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,510
they're not independent.

203
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,930
I can't just go well,
if omega 1 is one radium per second,

204
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,120
I have a fixed answer that's not true.

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,130
Because the coefficients that go
here depend on momentum and energy.

206
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,422
And so it's a little bit more complicated
if you also tumbling about another access,

207
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,940
your energy state is different,
momentum states are different, and

208
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,163
that will give you different A's and B's.

209
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,159
So you have to solve it for
that particular case.

210
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,670
So there are three uncoupled equations but
not independent equations.

211
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,640
Is that make sense?

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,630
They're coupled through this coefficients
through energy and momentum, precisely.

213
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,908
So, the three uncoupled oscillators and
that's there.

214
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:58,280
If I write them out to As and Bs, this
is what they are, as you can see, T and

215
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,110
H has appeared.

216
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,330
The inertia's always the same,
it's the same with your body.

217
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,460
But as your math was saying,
if H is different and

218
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,620
T is different, I would have different
coefficients, and all of a sudden and

219
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,940
then we get a different response
with these omegas, right?

220
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,140
So that's where it does matter.

221
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,107
But it's very elegant so for the general
case you can always write this as

222
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:21,128
a harmonious,
homogenous on them to Duffling equation.

223
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,800
Now with these parameters we'll look
at this a little bit more carefully but

224
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,560
you can see, for

225
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,460
example, the cubic stiffness terms Bs,
there's differences of inertias again.

226
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,300
So we know right away
if it's axis symmetric,

227
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,520
some of these things will go away,
some insight you get.

228
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,230
But at the same time,
I'd say if it's a cube or

229
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,190
a sphere, all of these terms go away.

230
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,704
For a sphere, none of that matters.

231
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:45,961
Even in here there's always differences
of inertia so for sphere again, As and

232
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,200
Bs go away which we talked about.

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,450
A sphere you can tumble about any axis and
it'll just continue to tumble,

234
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,510
your mega 1, 2, 3s are all flat lines,
always, or for a cube the same response.

235
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,320
But for general bodies,
if I1 is your largest inertia.

236
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,350
You can see this is going to be
a positive term times a positive term,

237
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,000
this is going to be
a positive cubic stiffness.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,920
Down here again, if I1 is the largest,
so this is going to be negative,

239
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,940
that's negative,
negative times negative is positive again.

240
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,720
Again we'll have a positive
stiffness whereas here

241
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,100
you'll have a negative stiffness.

242
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,281
So is positive stiffness good or
bad for a stability for a cubic one?

243
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,546
>> Good.

244
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:28,430
>> It's good.

245
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,825
It's pretty much analogous.

246
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:36,580
Instead of a liner response, now you
have something that's kind of cubic.

247
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,320
But you need the same kind of a sign,
right?

248
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,350
If you're positive, you want something
pulling you back to the origin.

249
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,980
The origin is the equilibrium
that we'll be studying here.

250
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,850
And if you're negative, you want
something positive to pull you back.

251
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,500
It's just got to be more aggressive for
big departures, but

252
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,710
way less aggressive for small departures.

253
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,400
So there's a difference
in the cubic terms.

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,680
That's why for a linearization, this is
the linear part it's going to dominate.

255
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,240
But if you go really big departures,
the cubic one is always going to win.

256
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,926
At some point,
x cubed is going to be bigger than x,

257
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:09,871
regardless of what these constant
coefficients are, these As and Bs.

258
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,740
So good.

259
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,389
So you can see just looking at
the signs of this we can get

260
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,519
some insight into what
must be happening and

261
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,988
we'll cover this a little bit more in
another slide as we go through it.
