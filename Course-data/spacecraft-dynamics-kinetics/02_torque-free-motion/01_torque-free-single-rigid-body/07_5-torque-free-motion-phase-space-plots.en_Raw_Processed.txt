insight we have, 
if we assume, we pole hold plots 
so without loss in generality, remember, 
we always flip principal axis that 
largest inertia is axis one, 
intermediate inertia is axis two least inertia axis 
is axis number three, right 
so, i assume this ordering 
then, we found earlier bs 
one three to positive, 
meaning strong stability large departures 
here, thats negative, something we to consider 
intermediate axis, we know, 
this one is always unstable, right 
that separatrix stuff, so surprising 
actually linearly stable, nonlinearly unstable 
twos you dont defined 
depends situation, 
youre that you tumbling 
that, you know, energy levels to get right sign 
so, different ways we this 
so, youre looking systems small departures, 
we said, well, you know, 
k times x is always going to bigger close to xs around zero, 
another a times x is going to bigger b times x cubed 
if x gets small enough 
x gets small, x cubed is even smaller, right, 
whereas x is going to bigger in that sense 
point, this magnitudes always 
crisscross x gets large, 
point, x cubed will dominate 
so, you use coefficients to argue 
if you a particular sign 
if a is positive, that means ive got a positive spring stiffness 
that omega one motion stay nicely bounded stable, 
nice oscillatory part 
if you big departures b is negative, 
that means you go far origin, 
doesnt oscillate point, 
going to take to infinity 
thats you find in this analysis 
vice versa, if a is negative, that means, well, 
wont stable 
small departures drive you away origin, 
if b happens to positive, in that case, 
remember you cant xs 
go to infinity point 
x cubed is going to dominate 
will try to bring back 
and, in nonlinear system you get things called limit cycles, 
doesnt converge to zero, 
two terms fight 
you get cyclic motions that happen in end 
thats converges to 
so, take off, this whole class is nonlinear systems 
that talk things 
so yeah, b always restoring if positive, 
we showed that 
phase plane plots 
lets talk that 
many you seen them, everybody, 
everybodys quite an engineering background 
so, if i a simple mx double dot plus kx system, right, 
is a phase space plot 
whats horizontal axis 
gamma x 
x 
whats vertical axis 
xdot, right 
so you solve this 
so, math numerically, 
you find 
x is going to be, you 
also a solution xdot is going to 
if numerical, you could, 
you know, youre always getting 
positions rates youre integrating, 
so you could keep track that 
phase space plot 
is nothing a visualization position rates 
so, im plotting versus time, im plotting 
added positions velocities compared directly 
so, if you an oscillator equation 
i give an initial deflection here, 
thats im starting, 
i a sinusoidal response, right 
initially, i take spring 
i deflect i gently let go 
system would oscillate, right 
happens to phase space plot 
that curve look like, spring mass system 
andrei 
circle 
a circle, this case, right 
so, point, this 
potential energy goes kinetic energy 
right slows 
then, net positions become negative 
becomes positive 
youre going to circle around, right 
if i give less deflection, 
you a curve that this 
if you give deflection, 
you bigger curves, right 
curves ever intersect 
if you start here, 
could this curve this go here 
a different system 
if dynamical system, 
you phase space lines intersect 
answer is really 
challenge that, if intercept, 
if you a different phase space plots, right 
means if curve this curve this, 
you hit this intersection points way you go 
a second order dynamical system 
if im giving a position velocity, accelerations 
dictated equations motion 
you cant going in two different directions 
maybe unless you go quantum stuff something, you know 
classic mechanics systems, if given a position velocity, 
there is a distinct acceleration 
that velocity will evolve in a certain direction 
so, you dont typically see lines intersect, 
you get flow diagrams that you draw, 
will show you stuff evolves 
ok 
so, thats a phase space, there a dot here 
thats a phase space plot is 
a phase space plot, lets still look x double dot kx, 
x double dot natural frequency squared x equal to zero 
is an equilibria, no, actually thats one im looking 
sinx equal to zero 
this is basically planar 
normalized version a planar pendulum 
that this problem talking earlier 
this system, equilibriums going to 
is x doubled dot x dot gonna go to zero 
if 
is x double dot gonna zero 
thats easy one 
zero 
thank you 
so, if, x is equal to zero pi 
so, a phase space plot, plus minus pi, right, 
you go upside this way this way, 
if hangs straight down, lets call that zero 
right 
we know if we linearize this, 
x double dot plus x, 
you guys arguing earlier, in that case, 
around equilibrium, 
thats zero equilibrium 
i would something phase space plots look like circles 
alright 
a certain direction 
if you go here, 
youd linearize around that 
here, youd end x double dot equal to minus x, 
x double dot minus x is equal to zero, 
gives you negative stiffness, 
actually hyperbolically unstable 
so theres asymptotes you draw, 
thats good 
so we larger departures, 
phase space plots look like this 
and, if youre lines, 
you would weird stuff, 
you could tumble one enough speed 
hit the, you know, 
you go here give enough initial speed 
to you would hit here again, 
different kinds motions, right 
but, thats phase space look like, 
so you quickly identify equilibriums 
if you this theres programs that will give you this flow, 
phase space flow, you will see dead spots 
equilibriums around it, 
flows visually quickly tell you this looks stable 
neighboring stuff neighboring 
comes in, stuff goes crazy, right 
so, thats quick review, if you havent seen phase space plots 
so, kind things linear cubic part used that, well 
so this is one phase space plots we could talk about, 
flow 
omegas nearby, omega twos look good, 
theres a limiting case, well 
turns out, this omega two this separatrix case, 
that intermediate axis case 
theres a limit 
if im a pure spin omega two, 
thats one conditions, anything inside is 
a nonpure spin intermediate axis, 
you can, turns out, you show, 
this paper showed, im that in class 
theres different limiting conditions 
that come with, 
physical motions never outside here 
you to within this arc 
you never actually exceed initial conditions 
will give you nonphysical initial states that youd to to get there
