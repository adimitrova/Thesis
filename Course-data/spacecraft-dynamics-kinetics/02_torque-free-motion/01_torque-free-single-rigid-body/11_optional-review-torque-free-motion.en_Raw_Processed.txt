looking torque free motion 
we plots 
let jump to this one 
so key things 
we polar plots 
nathaniel, you talk here 
this stuff actually show us, 
we get kind plots, 
we 
showing energy the, 
stability spinning, rigid body 
okay 
so 
so whats this sphere 
lets go back to basics, 
youre jumping details 
i dont remember name 
okay 
andrew 

sorry, next to nathaniel, yes, ick 
nick 
that off, completely 
momentum sphere 
a momentum sphere, right 
so instead using omega ones, 
twos, 
threes independent rate coordinates, 
we use h ones, twos, threes 
is nothing omega is times 
principal inertia, thats it, right 
convenient 
momentum magnitude constant, 
momentum vector 
using a sub result, 
a magnitude constant 
gives us a nice geometric answer, 
a sphere, causes 
intersections this sphere 
so intersecting a sphere 
an ellipsoid, 
an ellipsoid represents energy 
so rotational kinetic energy, 
using h coordinates, 
able to rewrite 
a classic ellipsoidal shape 
so weve got this ellipsoid 
we to intersect, so 
here im showing you lots 
different energy levels 
nathaniel talking stability 
if you hear stability, 
first thing you to think 
is stability 
so in plots we identified 
equilibrias, spin equilibrias 
so if you take an object 
you spin a certain axis, 
going to keep spinning, 
that omega stays constant 
omegas stay constants, right 
equilibrias we identified 
a torque free rigid body 
matt 
h h 
well, if you in 
h intersection, thats true 
this here, could you a pure spin, 
an equilibria here 
pragmatically, yes 
is an equilibria 
right, 
this is a common source confusion 
thats im glad well going 
this especially we get 
control stuff 
equilibrium means, x dot is equal 
to zero, here, x is omega right 
so omega rates zero, 
mathematical, mathematical 
thats an equilibrium 
system right 
equilibrium nothing 
to stability 
stability is a different argument 
sometimes, 
people confuse equilibrium 
stable things turning a round 
so youve got classical pendulum 
this is one equilibrium 
whats equilibrium 
we planar pendulum 
right, upside 
two equilibrius, 
a must, thats 
if i look stability i 
talk neighboring motions, 
if you a little bit this one 
gravity will basically help stabilize 
stays closed a little 
bit that thing settles 
if we turned upside down, if we 
to use a little bit departure, 
you going to stay close 
course 
we know deviate away, right 
so, keep two 
mathematical concepts separate, 
equilibrium means 
x star is equal to 
if you put in this condition 
would remain there perfectly 
stability talks well if im 
a little bit thats kind 
real world starts we never 
perfectly, well i stay close 
so you basically answered 
two spins that would stable 
if i a slightly 
minimum energy condition, 
i would one wobbles, 
you see you stay reasonably close 
thing here this is 
maximum energy condition, 
im spinning 
axis least inertia 
if im a little bit you 
see wobble lines intersection 
lines staying close 
this one though is unstable, thats 
one you take hammer 
you flip tool, always flips 
very, very, quickly, right 
so happens, you go this side 
you quickly go here, right 
now, there is a particular energy 
case, this is minimum energy, 
maximum energy 
here is intermediate access energy 
minimum, maximum 
general inertia 
theres one point one kind 
a spin youre spinning b b 
if you intermediate energy level 
you could spinning here mathematically, 
you could also this inner section 
line is called separatrix 
a single spin 
intermediate energy level 
thats solution, actually 
theres different arcs 
if youre lets say, 
you see arrows, come in 
you say you will 
approach this pure spin condition 
tebow, like if youre exactly it, 
itll take infinite to get there 
right 
you never actually reach this point 
in a fine right amount time 
right, so youre asymptotically 
ever reach this energy 
if you slightly this one 
we saw that in video last time 
astronaut spinning that key 
right, kind span 
looked like reasonably stable, 
a little bit wabble staying close 
next thing you know, 
flipped over, wabbled here 
flipped back again, 
kept that 
that one lines like here 
here 
so close to sphere spin 
intermediate axis inertia, 
tens to hand there a long, 
long time 
flips over, 
you never remain there 
whereas this one, you hang near 
a pure spin axis maximum inertia 
you will stay there forever, whereas 
this one you will keep flipping back 
forth back forth 
dont we typically fly space craft 
spinning axis least inertia 
so thats kind like 
a rocket body spinning this way 
besides seeing 
happened to explorer one, 
whats mathematical reason we 
dont like that stability there 
debo 
theres kind friction youre 
going to go in energy level 
get to separate 
this is assuming 
a perfectly mathematically rigid 
body real body will 
panels that will flex a little bit, 
inside there might 
a little bit give 
every time you a little bit 
friction youre losing mechanical energy, 
you could lose some, 
internal forces, right 
internal forces i 
actually change energy state, 
i lose energy, 
you bring energy state to 
enough flapping panels, 
fuel sloshing going on, 
will space craft ever come to rest 
daniel, you think 


minimum you get to is 
inaudible is tangent 
to sphere inside 
one that 
that this one 
right, you inaudible 
right, momentum internal forces 
fuel slosh, 
complicated equations 
partial differential equations surface 
interactions every stoke equations 
knows else 
internal forces 
weve shown angular momentum 
a system cannot change unless 
you apply external forces 
so, thats youre loosing energy, 
you will asymptotically get to 
this kind case you 
never bring craft to rest 
right, so quick 
answer questions that weve 
so good, little pole hole plots, 
quite common, 
you see sometimes 
different analysis 
well see after, going to 
a spin similar configuration 
spending much time one 
inaudible classic literature, 
youll often find 
kind illustrations 
i wanted to make sure 
youre familiar that 
here thing we last 
time torquefree motion 
equations we assume 
to a body frame thats principal, 
therefore inertia tensor is diagonal, 
right 
we get this nice form 
now, if we an axis symmetric body, 
you see here 
happens right hand side 
you always differences inertia, 
if axis symmetric that basically 
means two inertias to 
equal like this pen, 
orthogonal axis equal 
therefore one terms 
is going to go to zero 
immediately we know that omega dot is 
zero thats going to a constant 
very, 
trick to solve this last time was, 
we want to go equations 
we know omega is constant, 
to solve this theyre to couple 
first order differential equation 
omega that depends omega , 
omega that depends omega 
anybody remember trick 
we got to solve two 
coupled first order 
differential equations 
yeah 
one equations 
we differentiate again, 
seem counterintuitive 
trying to get rid dots, 
in fact we add dots first 
makes easier 
differentiating we 
get basically omega dot, 
omega a constant, you get omega dot 
we get to plug in coupled one that 
depends omega , you end 
a differential equation thats 
omega s, we traded two coupled 
first order differential equations 
two uncoupled second order 
differential equations right 
so that a trade this one 
is a classic spring mass system so 
you solve this easily 
anybody differential equations 
know to solve this right, 
is we 
so this is a classic answer if 
you an axisymmetric body 
we a numerical simulation, 
looking tumble rates, 
you see one flat lines 
thats expected, so 
spin axis symmetry 
is always going to constant 
two give you this 
nice sinusoidal response, 
if you look attitude, 
easy to predict
