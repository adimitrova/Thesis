now, here, i ran through a simulation
to kind of show you how these things evolve,
and how we can use these omegas phasespace plots
so i got omega  versus omega  dot
so my state versus a rate, state versus rate,
state versus rate, the same phasespace plot
im starting out with a minimum energy case actually,
which is here so, h overi,
if t becomes my intermediate
one, this value goes to one,
this is kind of a nice normalized way to look at it
but here t is less, so this value goes bigger, so here
on this pole hold plot and spinning right here purely about b,
in the phasespace plots so you can see i have a b
and no other velocity, it stays there
if it werent in equilibrium that point
would be moving through that plot
and the other two are perfectly zero
so thats a pure spin about b
thats a minimum energy case
now im holding momentum constant
and im pumping up the energy
so what happens  this one shift slightly
it basically means you look at
this coordinate here it was fixed
if im looking at this curve inside,
that curve will be recessed inward
from that equilibrium point,
and theres a slight wobble to it
because its a potato shaped like curve
thats why you see a little bit of
a wobble in that coordinate, but the other two axes,
the omega  which it spins about this axis
these coordinates kind of sweep back and forth
thats what youre seeing here
and the omega  coordinates also go up and down
up and down
right so it goes through the series
and this is what these answers would look like
so you can predict these motions given those
second order differential equations we derived
or you can just get them
numerically by solving eulers original equations
and thats we just take an energy
and slightly bumped it up
if we bump it up more
now im actually very close to the separatrix condition
not quite there but im pretty close
so its like one of these curves
and i get there and hang out
here along and then i come back again
and if you plotted this in a phase space you get
this teardrop looking thing
thats at t
and this is where you hang out a
long time and then you go back around,
because were close to the separatrix condition
the omega  part
that one just kind of oscillates back and forth
doesnt look too crazy
the omega  speed versus velocity starts to pinch,
and thats what you see happening here,
cause that has to do with the slowdown
as a student was saying earlier as we get close
to these corner points and the separatrix stuff,
thats where things really slow down all of a sudden
and so that position versus rate stuff
 not intuitive here  but if
you solved it, thats what you would have
so good, thats almost separatrix
if you make it a separatrix you get this
and the way i get a closed curve
is i had to really cheat and look
at the conditions on both sides and integrate
because we know starting from here,
this is basically on one of these separatrix lines
we know it would take an infinity of time to reach here
thats only the asymptote that we would reach
i can get the other part by starting on the other curve
and that kind of completes the picture
all right
so it looks like a bow tie but you never go from
one end of the bow tie to the other end of the bow tie or
propeller or whatever you want to call this shape
and this is this limiting case
as predicted early from the phasespace plot,
thats what you have with the separatrix
good
if we add more energy now were getting to some of these
curves up here it starts to look like before
this ones a little pinched dogbone shape still got an eyelid
this other one i lose one of these
now im either on left or the right hand side
which one depends also on initial conditions
this is where you go through this infinite sensitivity stuff
its hard to predict when youre doing just tumbles
are you going to spin about positive or negative
thats the chaotic part of this system
but here the numerics took me to one side
thats what im left with, then as i pump up energy now
it starts to tighten
now we get to these inner curves
and at the very end i pumped up energy as much as i can
i intercept here so you can see the phase space plots omega ones
and twos are just zero steady points
and im back in an equilibrium
thats doing a pure spin about axes of least inertia
so i hope we get it
this is just an illustration of how
we can use phasespace plots to actually
analyze whole ranges of motion
pole holds was one of them
this is another approach that you see quite conveniently
and we can also validate because you can
predict these motions with those
that make second order differential equations
or you can solve the coupled nonlinear equations that we had earlier
they should all give you the same answer
this is often a nice way to validate
that all this math we did, with momentum and energy constraints, we did it correctly
because otherwise these things wouldnt agree
any questions on this
this is the general inertia case
so we dont quite get the nice sines and cosines
analytic answer, but we do get three decoupled duffing equations
which is kind of elegant, as a subresult
