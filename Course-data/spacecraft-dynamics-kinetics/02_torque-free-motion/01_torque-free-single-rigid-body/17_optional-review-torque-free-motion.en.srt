1
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,725
We're looking at torque free motion.

2
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:13,855
And we did plots.

3
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:14,745
Let me jump to this one.

4
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:19,187
So what are the some key things
we did with these polar plots?

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,205
Nathaniel, can you talk me through here?

6
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,695
What does this stuff actually show us,

7
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,635
how do we get these kind of plots,
what are we doing?

8
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:31,535
>> We're showing the energy as the, and

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:37,120
the stability of the spinning, rigid body.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,291
>> Okay.
>> So-

11
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,587
>> So what's this sphere?

12
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:43,791
Let's go back to basics,
you're jumping into details.

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,570
>> I don't remember the name of it.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,880
>> Okay.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,570
Was it Andrew?

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,150
>> No.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,330
>> Sorry, next to Nathaniel, yes, Ick?

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,620
>> Nick.
>> That was off, completely.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,838
>> The momentum sphere.

20
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,880
>> It's a momentum sphere, right?

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,770
So instead of using omega one's,
two's, and

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,850
three's as independent rate coordinates,
we use h one's, two's, and three's.

23
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,800
Which is nothing but omega i's times
the principal inertia, that's it, right?

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,290
But it's convenient because
the momentum magnitude being constant,

25
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,510
not the momentum vector.

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,180
We're using a sub result,
just a magnitude being constant.

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,820
It gives us a nice geometric answer,

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,400
it's a sphere, what causes these
intersections on this sphere?

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,157
So we're intersecting a sphere with what?

30
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:34,730
An ellipsoid,
an ellipsoid represents energy.

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,940
So your rotational kinetic energy,
using the same H1 2 coordinates,

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,200
we're able to rewrite and
it's a classic ellipsoidal shape.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,080
So we've got this ellipsoid and
we have to intersect, so

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,880
here I'm showing you lots
of different energy levels.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,170
Nathaniel was talking about stability.

36
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,660
If you hear stability,

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,860
the first thing you have to think
about is stability about what?

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,800
So in these plots we identified
some equilibrias, spin equilibrias.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,690
So if you take an object and
you spin it about a certain axis,

40
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,640
it's just going to keep on spinning,
and that omega stays constant.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,810
And all the omegas stay constants, right.

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,430
What were the equilibrias we identified
for a torque free rigid body?

43
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,620
Matt.
>> H1 and H3.

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,590
>> Well, if you have it only in
H1 intersection, that's true.

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,960
This was here, could you have a pure spin,
an equilibria here?

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,870
>> Pragmatically, yes.

47
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,991
>> Then is it an equilibria or not?

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,980
All right,
this is a common source of confusion.

49
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,660
That's why I'm glad we'll be going over
this again especially as we get into

50
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,700
control stuff.

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,990
Equilibrium just means, x dot is equal
to zero, and here, x is my omega right?

52
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,950
So all my omega rates are zero,
it's not mathematical, not mathematical.

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,910
That's an equilibrium of
the system all right?

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,310
Equilibrium has nothing
to do with stability.

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,020
Stability is a different argument but
sometimes,

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,980
people confuse equilibrium being as
stable as things turning a round.

57
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,670
So you've got the classical pendulum
this is one of the equilibrium.

58
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,000
And what's the other equilibrium
we have over planar pendulum?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,230
Right, upside down.

60
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,520
Those are two equilibrius,
now its a must, that's it.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,372
But if I look at now stability I
can talk about neighboring motions,

62
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,612
if you just off a little bit on this one.

63
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,182
Gravity will basically help stabilize and

64
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:33,680
it stays closed a little
bit that thing it settles.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,200
If we turned it upside down, if we
have to use a little bit of departure,

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,980
are you going to stay close and
of course not.

67
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,840
We know it's can deviate away, right?

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,430
So, just keep those two
mathematical concepts separate,

69
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,070
equilibrium just means
your X star is equal to 0.

70
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,650
If you put it in this condition
it would remain there perfectly.

71
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,280
Stability now talks about well if I'm off
a little bit and that's kind of where

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,780
the real world starts because we never
have it perfectly, well do I stay close?

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,780
So of these you basically answered
the two spins that would be stable

74
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,170
if I have a slightly more than
my minimum energy condition,

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,120
I would be one of these wobbles, and
you can see you stay reasonably close.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,370
Same thing here this is
the maximum energy condition,

77
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm spinning about
the axis of least inertia.

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,370
And if I'm off a little bit you can

79
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,939
see wobble lines these intersection
lines are staying close.

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,940
This one though is unstable, that's
the one where you take your hammer and

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,490
you flip your tool, it always flips
180 very, very, very quickly, right?

82
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,740
So what happens, you go from this side and
you quickly go over here, all right?

83
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,450
Now, there is a very particular energy
case, this is the minimum energy,

84
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,150
maximum energy and
here is the intermediate access energy.

85
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,480
For minimum, maximum or
its general inertia

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,880
there's only one point one kind of
a spin you're spinning about b1 or b3.

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,260
If you have the intermediate energy level
you could be spinning here mathematically,

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,850
or you could also be on this inner section
line which is called the separatrix.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,720
It's not just a single spin for
the intermediate energy level

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,250
that's the solution, it's actually
there's these different arcs.

91
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,560
Now if you're on the let's say,
you can see the arrows, they come in.

92
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,140
What can you say about how you will
approach this pure spin condition?

93
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,015
>> Tebow, like if you're exactly on it,
it'll take infinite to get there.

94
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:20,553
>> Right.

95
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,878
You never actually reach this point
in a fine right amount of time.

96
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:26,230
RIght, so you're only asymptotically
ever reach it on this energy

97
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,070
if you slightly off this one.

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,430
We saw that in the video last time
with the astronaut spinning that key.

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,980
Right, it kind of span.

100
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,170
It looked like it was reasonably stable,
a little bit of wabble but staying close.

101
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,940
The next thing you know,
it flipped over, wabbled here and

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,650
then it flipped back again,
and it just kept doing that.

103
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,580
That was one of the lines like here or
here.

104
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,440
So when it's close to the sphere spin
about the intermediate axis of inertia,

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,320
it tens to hand out there a long,
long time.

106
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,500
And then it flips over, but
you never remain there.

107
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,140
Whereas this one, you can hang out near
a pure spin about axis of maximum inertia.

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,960
And you will stay there forever, whereas
this one you will keep flipping back and

109
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
forth back and forth.

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,830
Now why don't we typically fly space craft
spinning about the axis of least inertia?

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,340
So that's kind of like having
a rocket body spinning this way.

112
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,530
Besides seeing what
happened to explorer one,

113
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,189
what's the mathematical reason we
don't like that stability up there?

114
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,010
Debo.

115
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,270
>> There's any kind of friction you're
going to go down in the energy level and

116
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,480
get to the separate.

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,760
>> This is all assuming
a perfectly mathematically rigid

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,490
body and any real body will have some
panels that will flex just a little bit,

119
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,270
inside there might be just
a little bit of give.

120
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,690
Every time you have a little bit of
friction you're losing mechanical energy,

121
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,610
and you could lose some,
these are all internal forces, all right.

122
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,510
With internal forces I can
actually change my energy state,

123
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,390
I can lose energy, but
can you bring your energy state to 0?

124
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,993
With enough flapping of the panels,
of fuel sloshing going on,

125
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,272
will your space craft ever come to rest?

126
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:06,506
Daniel, what do you think?

127
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,022
>> No.

128
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,765
>> Why not?
>> The minimum you can get to is just the.

129
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:16,290
The [INAUDIBLE] is only tangent
to the sphere from the inside.

130
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,800
>> Which one was that?

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,895
That was this one.

132
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:22,090
All right, you do [INAUDIBLE].

133
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,932
Right, your momentum internal forces and
fuel slosh,

134
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:26,690
as complicated as equations are.

135
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,600
Partial differential equations and surface
interactions and every stoke equations and

136
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,090
who knows what else.

137
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,510
It only internal forces and
we've shown up angular momentum

138
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,550
of a system cannot change unless
you apply external forces.

139
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,630
So, that's why when you're loosing energy,
you will asymptotically get to

140
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,610
this kind of the case which you
can never bring the craft to rest.

141
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,440
All right, so those are all quick
answer questions that we've had.

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
So good, these little pole hole plots,
they are quite common,

143
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,610
you see these sometimes
with different analysis.

144
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,841
We'll see after, it's going to do
a spin or similar configuration.

145
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:00,394
We're not spending too much time on one
but [INAUDIBLE] classic literature,

146
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,740
you'll often find these
kind of illustrations.

147
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,810
And I wanted to make sure
you're familiar with that.

148
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,360
Here the thing we did last
time was Torque-Free Motion.

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,530
These are the equations where we assume
to have a body of frame that's principal,

150
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,540
therefore the inertia tensor is diagonal,
right.

151
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,910
We get this nice form.

152
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,739
Now, if we have an axis symmetric body,

153
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:23,747
you can see from here what
happens on the right hand side.

154
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:28,489
You always have differences of inertia,
and if it's axis symmetric that basically

155
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,626
means two inertias have to be
equal about like this pen,

156
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,580
about orthogonal axis are equal.

157
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,369
Therefore one of the terms
is going to go to zero and

158
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:41,510
immediately we know that omega dot is
zero and that's going to be a constant.

159
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,785
Very, and
the trick how to solve this last time was,

160
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,955
we want to go from these equations.

161
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:49,130
We know Omega 3 is constant, and

162
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,794
to solve this they're now to couple
first order differential equation

163
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:58,550
Omega 1 that depends on Omega 2, and
Omega 2 that depends on Omega 1.

164
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,210
Anybody remember the trick
how we got to solve these two

165
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,740
coupled first order
differential equations?

166
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,100
Yeah?
>> One of the equations?

167
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,380
>> We differentiate them again,
which can seem counterintuitive.

168
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,760
We're trying to get rid of dots,

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,650
in fact we add dots first
because it makes it easier.

170
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,930
By differentiating them we
get basically omega 1 dot,

171
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,540
omega 3's a constant, you get omega 2 dot.

172
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,260
Now we get to plug in the coupled one that
depends on omega 1, and you end up with

173
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,980
a differential equation that's only
omega 1s, but we traded two coupled.

174
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,470
First order differential equations for

175
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,370
two uncoupled second order
differential equations right.

176
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,070
So that was a trade off but this one
is a classic spring mass system so

177
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,980
you can solve this very easily.

178
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,920
Anybody who has differential equations
should know how to solve this all right,

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,000
which is what we did.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,530
So this is a classic answer if
you have an axisymmetric body And

181
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,480
when we do a numerical simulation,
just looking at the tumble rates,

182
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,060
you can see one of them flat lines.

183
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,270
That's expected, so

184
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,400
the spin about the axis of symmetry
is always going to be constant.

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,989
And the other two give you this
nice sinusoidal response, but

186
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,242
if you look at the attitude,
it's not easy to predict.
