quick questions 
kind shape i if 
interception curves look like this 
symmetric 
is axisymmetric 
i know, you took in 
youve seen this one 
is axisymmetric 
energy ellipsoid is 
width in one two axis 
interception 
lines constant h 
if you go back 
look differential equations here, 
h that means omega three is constant, 
this will go to omega three dot 
goes to zero if i is equal to i 
you a constant h, 
right 
thats intersection point 
that youre going to have, 
spinning this way 
if youre here though, that means that 
omega three, h coordinate is zero, 
therefore omega three coordinate is zero 
if omega three is zero, 
this one is already zero to 
begin inertias 
if omega three is zero these, omega threes 
make terms go to zero 
thats you get points 
pure spin conditions 
that you would 
dont wobble beyond that 
kind shape is this going to 
so basically, says whatever spin axis 
i pick, going to stay there 
sphere 
sphere 
a sphere, good 
a sphere, you take a sphere 
spin axis 
itll keep spinning 
that is a pure spin 
so, sphere is an easy one 
matter bad you are, 
youre spinning a principal axis, 
wouldnt a sphere 
is there another shape you could use 
cube 
you need is principal inertias 
to equal, a cube, 
thats case 
we dont a spherical 
mass distribution, 
we still get three equal 
thats easy, 
actually, to throw a cube 
a cube random, in that case 
so if you go to vegas throw dice, 
give you random stuff 
every throw 
an equal probability, 
unless youre playing 
a professional gambler, in case, 
put a slight mass in there, right 
bias in one direction 
this kind is longer true, 
we longer equal inertias 
thats gamblers today, 
theyre smart math 
im sure you this way, 
testing that 
laugh 
laugh 
cube is one things, 
exactly 
spheres people often think it, 
cubes, 
cubes ask kind things well 
if you want to spin axis, 
actually you spin them, 
long a perfect 
mass distribution 
while we build cube sized spacecraft, 
internals arent necessarily homogeneous, 
so even a cube outer shape, 
you still to look internal 
wheres battery 
wheres antenna 
right, that could shift 
give you three unique inertias 
if you fill lead 
launch it, that would happen 
okay
