duffing equation gets a little bit interesting 
so, im showing here v is equal to 
a unit a a unit b, so i have, 
basically, x dot is equal to x double dot plus x plus x cubed 
thats im simulating in this one 
but, this gives that phase space plot 
talking duffing equation, 
theres a reversal signs well 
this part would stabilizing 
this part is actually destabilizing 
thats kind we omega two motion 
that that case, 
this is phase space 
if opposite signs, 
x double dot go to zero if xs zero, 
is kind makes sense 
thats right here, around 
we get something that looks a lot like 
an oscillator equations, nearly circular stuff 
but, you also get an equilibrium if x is, you know, 
if x is equal to one, 
you minus one plus one cubed 
still one gives you equal to zero 
so, plus one is one minus one 
so, two equilibriums that we read 
this phase space plot, 
that we 
then, we fun 
we play this make this a little bit bigger 
so here, im plotting phase space plot 
possible, you know, lots initial conditions 
if you started here, 
this is would happen to curves 
im plotting a fixed amount time 
this is a way i show you, 
numerically, separatrix motions 
we saw in video, those, 
that spinning handle, right 
hung there a certain amount time, 
went back to side, came back 
and, we talked you hang near 
separatrix motion, you get there 
so, here, ive got something is i put 
an initial condition quickly solves 
differential equations, 
shows resulting phase space motion 
if i put initial condition here, 
you know, starts big 
i a cube, an unstable cubic term, 
so that one would go to infinity, expected 
right if im really, 
if i small departures, 
stable linear term keeps stable if i get far, 
point unstable cubic will dominate 
thats whats happening 
if i reduce integration time, 
you will see that curve gets smaller 
so, you see happens 
here, i mean, linear part, 
im a fraction an orbit 
but, i start to get close to separatrix motion, 
you see i dont get far 
id to get really precise 
so, i increase, 
im exactly 
you see im increasing, 
that curve gets close really hangs 
there a while, eventually moves back 
thats precisely we saw happening 
that handle that astronauts spun, right 
hung there a while 
if i could get precisely it, 
i mean is sensitive 
if im off, hangs there even longer 
if i perfectly it, 
would hang there forever, 
never quite get there 
if youre infinitesimally, 
you go in a whole different place, right 
thats definition chaos, 
infinite sensitivity to initial conditions 
youre smidgen to left, you go there 
you smidgen right, you go somewhere completely different 
thats this is a, hopefully, 
visual illustration talking 
separatrix motions conditions 
so, kind fun to play 
we come in enough time to actually 
complete phase space plots 
im also showing speed in here somewhat, 
so im coming in 
i dont need that 
anyway 
i talking 
speeds yes, this is showing something speeds 
here you got green is faster, 
blues purples is fast, 
you come in, 
past greens, yellows, 
so reds that gets much slower 
if youre close to equilibrium, 
you a nice slow, 
a little bit a wobble 
if you get close here you really slow 
around it, we speed to flip back 
so this is kind a nice way to close 
torquefree motion part a single rigid body 
weve seen video that illustrated 
weve seen whole hold plots that graphically 
weve seen mathematical formulations we 
axisymmetric general cases, 
different predictions that you 
different motions things behave
