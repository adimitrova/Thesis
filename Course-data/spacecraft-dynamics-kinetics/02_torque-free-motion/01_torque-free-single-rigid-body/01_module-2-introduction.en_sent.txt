hi and welcome to the second segment of spacecraft kinetics.
here, we're going to be looking at torque free motion on rigid bodies.
we start out with a single rigid body and study how this actually will evolve over time.
how does the spin change?
and this is all coupled to the gyroscopics.
we will study this with several different methods.
one of them is called portal.
it's a very cool graphical way actually to study large scale motions and why are certain spins stable and unstable.
we're also then going to be looking at different specialized analytic answers where we can consider things like axisymmetric bodies that have special answers or bodies that have.
distinct inertias like this box here, we go to skinny, intermediate, and maximum edge.
you'll answer questions like why is this spin more or less stable, while if you do the other spin about the intermediate axis, you'll find it flips very quickly.
so we're going to show those results.
in the end, we're going to look at the dual spinner, which another passive way to stabilize an object.
so while certain spin orientations for the single body are unstable, with a double body system, we can actually stabilize any of those axes.
and we go through the mathematics of developing equations of motion, looking at equilibria, and then discussing stability again.
