theres an integral, every one 
equations we actually integrate 
come conserved quantities 
you think im calling k here, 
this is kinetic energy, 
something different 
like energy, so 
an integral motion basically 
so leaves us a waypoint 
to go to a set slides 
so lets say we 
classic mx double dot 
kx 
anybody know integral 
motion this one is 
whats preserved quantity 
this differential equation 
spring mass system 
whats constant 
you in homework 
two particles in spring mass 
part b, you to 
use to get that relationship 
energy, right 
basically 
we know this, this is nothing 
a spring mass system 
so we know that that kinetic energy 
spring potential energy summed 
will give us a constant, right 
we know that 
we mathematically prove 
so im going to show you quickly 
to integrate system 
this is a simple linear system 
this term there, cubic 
stiffness an x cubed instead an x 
even x cubed is trivial to integrate 
i expect you guys to know 
to integrate x cubed 
in next homework you will 
terms in there 
there one homework 
you end a sine theta, 
even sine theta isnt that evil 
i know you guys know to 
integrate sine theta, hopefully 
so you come 
integrals motions, right 
so lets see we this 
theres little tricks 
youd to write to 
remember little steps 
so ive got second ordered 
derivative x equals to minus kx 
this works nicely 
im going to a substitution 
im saying v is simply x dot, right 
commonly done, 
like you in second order system, 
we put in first order forms 
integrate 
thats typically we 
so this side 
rewritten dvdt kx 
you also say, well, 
let multiply this dt 
to side 
so mass times differential velocities 
equal to kx times differential time 
this phone, 
this side is easy to integrate 
thats mdv 
integral that is going to 
a give you v plus constant 
right hand side, x depends 
time we dont an answer 
in this form yet 
is easy, so you get to 
stage breaking dts dvs up, 
trick is you want to 
multiply sides times v 
is course dxdt, 
right thats x means 
so if i multiply 
sides this 
here left hand side, 
im going to mvdv, thats easy 
so, right hand side kx times v 
v is dxdtdt 
dts cancel 
you end nothing 
kxdx, thats 
weve got a set equations we 
easily integrate im 
in between two specific points in time im 
going to get indefinite integral 
so, if you indefinite 
integral this, 
integral v respect to v is 
going to v squared right 
so you end mass velocity 
squared two is nothing 
kinetic energy 
right hand side, 
integral x respect to x is 
going to kx squared 
this whole thing 
you to plus a constant 
whats this constant physically 
going to in this problem 
if you look constant mv 
squared plus kx squared , 
is that 
total energy exactly thats 
thats a physical thing 
in a abstract sense you 
differential equations we 
often this step 
you dont get something thats 
actually in terms energy 
an equation constant whatever 
things right 
so here happens to total energy 
if you go back to differential 
equations steps 
bring this to right hand side 
instead a minus a omega 
i also also minus b omega cubed, 
i integrals in end 
ill an x to th 
an x squared 
right constants, 
an integration constant, right 
thats we found here, 
so if you that step, 
i encourage you to practice that 
in homework you to 
use anyway one solve 
homework for, you get this 
so this is integration constant, 
you see this is mass velocity 
squared units wrong this 
is actually velocity rates, 
this is an acceleration squared, 
this cant energy 
something energy like in that 
term this is a preserve quantity 
if i get resulting tumbling motion 
integration, every 
integration times that if youre computing 
mega integrated you 
current omega you go this 
math, you always get k 
right 
so this becomes great integration 
check talk free motion well 
i think one homeworks, in 
next homeworks said you numerically 
stimulate this validate that this 
actually, you stimulate this numerically, 
you compute this analytically 
ts hs 
this math always 
give you back that value 
that everything make sense 
thats a good numerical 
check whats going 
so this k, 
written in terms energies, 
integration constants 
system 
so im giving you complete 
answer here this stage
