1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,929
Now, here, I ran through a simulation

2
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,195
to kind of show you how these things evolve,

3
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:14,695
and how we can use these Omega's phase-space plots.

4
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,214
So I got Omega 1 versus Omega 1 dot.

5
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:20,149
So my state versus a rate, state versus rate,

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,464
state versus rate, the same phase-space plot.

7
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm starting out with a minimum energy case actually,

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,330
which is here. So, H overI2,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,265
if T becomes my intermediate

10
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,759
one, this value goes to one,

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,259
this is kind of a nice normalized way to look at it.

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:39,784
But here T is less, so this value goes bigger, so here

13
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:44,439
on this pole hold plot and spinning right here purely about B1,

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,100
in the phase-space plots so you can see I have a B1

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,435
and no other velocity, it stays there.

16
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,289
If it weren't in equilibrium that point

17
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,979
would be moving through that plot.

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,265
And the other two are perfectly zero.

19
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,062
So that's a pure spin about B1.

20
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,630
That's a minimum energy case.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,340
Now I'm holding momentum constant

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,435
and I'm pumping up the energy.

23
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,704
So what happens - this one shift slightly.

24
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,909
It basically means you look at

25
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,674
this coordinate here it was fixed.

26
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:11,659
If I'm looking at this curve inside,

27
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,030
that curve will be recessed inward

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,254
from that equilibrium point,

29
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,915
and there's a slight wobble to it

30
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:19,745
because it's a potato shaped like curve.

31
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,194
That's why you see a little bit of

32
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:25,614
a wobble in that coordinate, but the other two axes,

33
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,340
the Omega 2 which it spins about this axis.

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,905
These coordinates kind of sweep back and forth

35
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,400
that's what you're seeing here.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,239
And the Omega 3 coordinates also go up and down

37
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,040
up and down.

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,814
Right. So it goes through the series.

39
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,689
And this is what these answers would look like.

40
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,004
So you can predict these motions given those

41
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,015
second order differential equations we derived

42
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:44,989
or you can just get them

43
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,769
numerically by solving Euler's original equations.

44
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,415
And that's we just take an energy

45
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:50,685
and slightly bumped it up.

46
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,935
If we bump it up more

47
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:55,245
now I'm actually very close to the separatrix condition.

48
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,439
Not quite there but I'm pretty close.

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
So it's like one of these curves.

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,739
And I get there and hang out

51
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,594
here along and then I come back again.

52
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,670
And if you plotted this in a phase space you get

53
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,165
this teardrop looking thing

54
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,645
that's at t=0.

55
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,590
And this is where you hang out a

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,824
long time and then you go back around,

57
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:14,574
because we're close to the separatrix condition.

58
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:15,800
The Omega 2 part

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,925
that one just kind of oscillates back and forth

60
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,300
doesn't look too crazy.

61
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,289
The Omega 3 speed versus velocity starts to pinch,

62
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,270
and that's what you see happening here,

63
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,229
cause that has to do with the slowdown

64
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,090
as [a student] was saying earlier as we get close

65
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,280
to these corner points and the separatrix stuff,

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,474
that's where things really slow down all of a sudden.

67
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,705
And so that position versus rate stuff

68
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,039
- not intuitive here - but if

69
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,210
you solved it, that's what you would have.

70
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,898
So good, that's almost separatrix.

71
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,620
If you make it a separatrix you get this.

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,544
And the way I get a closed curve

73
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:46,789
is I had to really cheat and look

74
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:49,414
at the conditions on both sides and integrate.

75
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,349
Because we know starting from here,

76
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,229
this is basically on one of these separatrix lines.

77
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,965
We know it would take an infinity of time to reach here.

78
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,074
That's only the asymptote that we would reach.

79
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:02,134
I can get the other part by starting on the other curve.

80
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,770
And that kind of completes the picture.

81
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,349
All right.

82
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,889
So it looks like a bow tie but you never go from

83
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,229
one end of the bow tie to the other end of the bow tie or

84
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,219
propeller or whatever you want to call this shape.

85
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,055
And this is this limiting case

86
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,844
as predicted early from the phase-space plot,

87
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,174
that's what you have with the separatrix.

88
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:17,835
Good.

89
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:20,419
If we add more energy now we're getting to some of these

90
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:23,300
curves up here it starts to look like before.

91
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,529
This one's a little pinched dogbone shape still got an eyelid.

92
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,419
This other one I lose one of these.

93
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,384
Now I'm either on left or the right hand side.

94
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:34,189
Which one depends also on initial conditions.

95
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,889
This is where you go through this infinite sensitivity stuff.

96
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,719
It's hard to predict when you're doing just tumbles.

97
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,319
Are you going to spin about positive or negative.

98
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,814
That's the chaotic part of this system.

99
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:48,050
But here the numerics took me to one side.

100
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,125
That's what I'm left with, then as I pump up energy now

101
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,370
it starts to tighten.

102
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,180
Now we get to these inner curves

103
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,659
and at the very end I pumped up energy as much as I can.

104
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,889
I intercept here so you can see the phase space plots Omega ones

105
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,389
and twos are just zero steady points.

106
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,539
And I'm back in an equilibrium.

107
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,250
That's doing a pure spin about axes of least inertia.

108
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,319
So I hope we get it.

109
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,830
This is just an illustration of how

110
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,525
we can use phase-space plots to actually

111
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,339
analyze whole ranges of motion.

112
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,774
Pole holds was one of them.

113
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,239
This is another approach that you see quite conveniently.

114
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,204
And we can also validate because you can

115
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,750
predict these motions with those

116
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,475
that make second order differential equations

117
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:29,459
or you can solve the coupled non-linear equations that we had earlier.

118
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,225
They should all give you the same answer.

119
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,634
This is often a nice way to validate

120
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:38,254
that all this math we did, with momentum and energy constraints, we did it correctly.

121
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,970
Because otherwise these things wouldn't agree.

122
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,250
Any questions on this?

123
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,475
This is the general inertia case.

124
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,675
So we don't quite get the nice sines and cosines

125
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:51,829
analytic answer, but we do get three de-coupled duffing equations

126
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:54,720
which is kind of elegant, as a sub-result.
