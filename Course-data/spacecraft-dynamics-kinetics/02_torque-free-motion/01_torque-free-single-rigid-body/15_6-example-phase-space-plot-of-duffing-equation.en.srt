1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,554
The Duffing equation gets a little bit more interesting.

2
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:13,890
So, I'm just showing here v is equal to

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,199
a unit a and a unit b, so I just have,

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,030
basically, x dot is equal to x double dot plus x plus x cubed.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,559
That's what I'm simulating in this one.

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,550
But, this gives me now that phase space plot

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,475
we're talking about with the Duffing equation,

8
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:36,713
and there's a reversal of signs as well.

9
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:38,140
This part would be stabilizing;

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,355
this part is actually destabilizing.

11
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,940
That's kind of what we had with the omega two motion.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,420
That was that case,

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,975
and this is the phase space.

14
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:47,695
If these have opposite signs,

15
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,509
your x double dot can go to zero if all the x's are zero,

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,045
which is kind of makes sense.

17
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,320
That's right here, and around

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,850
it we get something that looks a lot like

19
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,505
an oscillator equations, nearly circular stuff.

20
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:01,780
But, you can also get an equilibrium if x is, you know,

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,980
if x is equal to one,

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,040
then you have minus one plus one cubed

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,849
just still one gives you equal to zero.

24
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,000
So, plus one is one and minus one.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,950
So, those are two equilibriums that we can read out

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,907
from this phase space plot,

27
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,189
that we can do.

28
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,930
Then, we can have some fun.

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,106
We can play with this and make this a little bit bigger.

30
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:24,219
So here, I'm plotting the same phase space plot

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,769
of all the possible, you know, lots of initial conditions.

32
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,150
If you started up here,

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,340
this is what would happen to your curves

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,069
and I'm plotting for a fixed amount of time.

35
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,444
This is a way then I can show you,

36
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,219
numerically, the separatrix motions.

37
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,929
We saw it in the video, those,

38
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,980
that spinning handle, right?

39
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,084
It hung out there for a certain amount of time,

40
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:44,200
and then it went back to the other side, and came back.

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,344
And, we talked about how you hang out near

42
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:49,394
the separatrix motion, as you get there.

43
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,879
So, here, what I've got something is I can put

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,980
an initial condition and it quickly solves

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,237
the differential equations,

46
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,935
and shows me the resulting phase space motion.

47
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,459
If I put my initial condition up here,

48
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,290
you know, starts very big.

49
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,569
I had a cube, an unstable cubic term,

50
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,984
so that one would go off to infinity, as expected.

51
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,159
Right? If I'm really,

52
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,814
if I have small departures,

53
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,810
stable linear term keeps me stable but if I get too far,

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,502
at some point the unstable cubic will dominate.

55
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,000
And that's what's happening.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,210
If I reduce my integration time,

57
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,960
you will see that curve gets smaller.

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,770
So, you can see now what happens.

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,419
Here, I mean, the linear part,

60
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,310
I'm just doing a fraction of an orbit.

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,460
But, as I start to get close to the separatrix motion,

62
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,655
you can see I don't get very far.

63
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:42,395
I'd have to get really precise.

64
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,599
So, as I increase,

65
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,419
I'm not exactly on it.

66
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,120
But you can see as I'm increasing,

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,569
that curve gets close and really hangs out

68
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,854
there for a while, and eventually it moves back.

69
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:57,509
That's precisely what we saw happening

70
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:00,529
with that handle that the astronauts spun, right?

71
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,909
It hung out there for a while.

72
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,829
If I could get more precisely on it,

73
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,050
I mean it is very very sensitive.

74
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,254
If I'm off, it hangs out there even longer.

75
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,993
And if I were perfectly on it,

76
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,689
it would hang out there forever,

77
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,245
and never quite get there.

78
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,906
If you're off infinitesimally,

79
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,350
and you go in a whole different place, right?

80
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,810
And that's the definition of chaos,

81
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,669
infinite sensitivity to initial conditions.

82
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,889
You're smidgen to left, and you go off there.

83
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,500
You smidgen right, you go somewhere completely different.

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,245
That's why this is just a, hopefully,

85
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,219
visual illustration of why we're talking

86
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,805
about separatrix motions and the conditions.

87
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,270
So, it's kind of fun to play with.

88
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,090
But as we come in and have enough time to actually

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,030
complete my phase space plots.

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,335
I'm also showing speed in here somewhat,

91
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:47,430
so as I'm coming in.

92
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,930
I don't need that.

93
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,865
Anyway.

94
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,960
What was I talking about?

95
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,039
Speeds. Yes, this is showing something about the speeds.

96
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,645
Here you got green is faster,

97
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,354
blues and purples is very fast,

98
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:00,814
but once you come in,

99
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,310
past the greens, yellows,

100
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,125
so the reds that gets much slower again.

101
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,460
If you're close to the equilibrium,

102
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,525
you just have a nice slow,

103
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:07,740
just a little bit of a wobble.

104
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,169
And if you get close here you really slow down.

105
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,675
But then around it, we speed up to flip back again.

106
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,895
So this is just kind of a nice way to close out

107
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:17,519
the torque-free motion part for a single rigid body.

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,230
We've seen the video that illustrated it.

109
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,814
We've seen up whole hold plots that do it graphically.

110
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:24,180
We've seen mathematical formulations where we did

111
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,144
the axisymmetric and general cases,

112
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:28,110
and the different predictions that you can do

113
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,569
about these different motions and how things behave.
