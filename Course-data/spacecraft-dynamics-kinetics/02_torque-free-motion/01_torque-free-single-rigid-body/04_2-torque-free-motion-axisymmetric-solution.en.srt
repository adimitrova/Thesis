1
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:09,778
So good, analytic one,
this is pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:13,070
Actually, you do something on
this in the homeworks, as well.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,990
So if we have torque free motion,
we've assumed the principal frame.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,640
These are the three equations you have.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,370
The only thing I've dropped was the l1,
2, 3, there's no external torque.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,690
So this is a pure spin, you take an
object, and you spin it up, what happens?

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,726
But in particular now,
we want to look at an axisymmetric case.

8
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,510
So here we're going to
assume this diagonal still.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,620
And if we assume it's axisymmetric,
like a cylinder, rocket bodies.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,090
Many spacecraft kind of have axisymmetry
just to coming out of the launch vehicle,

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,570
to have to get through the atmosphere.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,590
So it is a common shape assumption.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,580
We picked b1, b2 to be a transverse and
then b3 is the axis of symmetry.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,380
So I1 and I2 have to be equal,
I'm just calling it It, right?

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,630
Those are the two transverse axes.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,640
If you do that, and plug it in,
the last one that was I2 minus I1, or

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
I1 minus I2, that's going to go to 0.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,735
So immediately we have an omega 3 dot.

19
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,940
Whatever spin you give it
about the axis of symmetry,

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,070
that spin rate just stays a flat line.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,299
Doesn't change.

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,039
The other two will actually change and

23
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:19,576
they are the function of the inertia
about the symmetry axis and

24
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:24,560
the transverse inertia, and
of course, initial conditions.

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
So now we have two equations and
two unknowns.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,396
This one falls out because omega 3 dot,
that makes omega 3 a constant.

27
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:36,760
That means up here omega 3 is
simply the initial omega 3.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,919
It's no longer not known, it's a known
quantity by initial conditions.

29
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,464
So, we're left with omega 1, and

30
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:45,860
omega 2 and we've got two first
order differential equations.

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,297
How do we solve this?

32
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:51,083
This is one of the cases when you're
trying to solve these things,

33
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,340
you try to get rid of the dots.

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,252
And the easiest path is not to get rid of
the dots is actually to add more dots and

35
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,848
that gives you an answer
that we can find in the end.

36
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:03,950
If I differentiate this equation this
is shouldn't be bold actually, unbold.

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,330
But just take the dots.

38
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,364
Inertia is a constant.

39
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:11,420
Omega 2, omega 3's a constant, so there's
no omega 3 dot, but omega 2 could vary.

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,650
You can see omega 1 only depends on
omega 2, and if I go back a slide,

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,970
the omega 2 dot only depends on omega 1,
again, treating omega 3 as a constant.

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,623
So if I differentiate 1, I now get
an omega 2 dot, which depends on omega 1.

43
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:32,752
And you can plug that in and
you end up with this equation,

44
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,850
that's omega 1 double dot plus
something times omega 1 equal to 0.

45
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,096
Which for engineers, like yes,

46
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,419
I knew there'd be a spring-mass
system somewhere, right.

47
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,360
This is a typical spring-mass system.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,770
You know how to find these answers, and
they will give you the typical sines and

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,875
cosine results.

50
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,143
So, x double dock + kx can you
solve that differential equation?

51
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:56,885
That's what it boils down to,
for an axis symmetric case.

52
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,105
You can do the same things for omega 2,

53
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,672
it gives you the same kind of
a constant Inertia's a constant,

54
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:07,170
omega 3 is a constant, so all of this
is nothing but k in the end, right?

55
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,229
If you did a spring-mass analogy.

56
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,374
So for axi-symmetric cases,
it's easy to do.

57
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:15,395
Then, I think in the homework
you do this yourself.

58
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,817
Show me that you remember how to solve
simple first order differential equations.

59
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:22,742
You plug in the conditions,
come up with these coefficients.

60
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:24,703
And this one here is called omega p.

61
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:27,820
I can rewrite it, and so
now it has to do with this.

62
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,555
What's interesting here is is I3 is for
example less than IT.

63
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:33,620
That's this kind of stuff.

64
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,010
The inertia about the transverse on this
pen is much bigger than the inertia about

65
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,000
the symmetry axis all right.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,707
So in that case this is
a ratio less than 1 minus 1,

67
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:46,261
it's going to give you
omega 3 which is positive.

68
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:49,260
That's going to give you
now a negative omega p.

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,321
We saw on the pole hold plus
does momentum spheres and

70
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:59,252
energye lipsoids if I'm doing a spin
near the axis of least inertia,

71
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:03,370
that was the i-3 axis, so
those wobbles up there.

72
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,670
We would be orbiting in a negative sense,
and that comes from the sine right here.

73
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,070
If we have I3 being the axis of largest
inertia, so we have just a plate.

74
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,174
Think of a big, flat plate basically
spinning, right, and you're off slightly.

75
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,843
Now I3 is actually, so it's oproid body,
I3's bigger than the transverse inertia,

76
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:26,390
and this becomes more than 1,
then -1 is still positive.

77
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,617
That's why there we saw those curves
orbiting in a positive sense.

78
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,111
But this is the classic
answer that you have for

79
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:38,310
a rigid body, no torques,
but it's axis symmetric.

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,020
So we make that one assumption,
and this is just a classic result.

81
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,280
Make sure you can derive this.

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
This is pretty straightforward.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
Here are some answers.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,740
If you integrate the equations, you
would see, just using those differential

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,280
equations we talked, i omega dot plus
omega ~ i omega equal to 0, in this case.

86
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,990
And you integrate this stuff, you would
get these curves, which then show you yes,

87
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,730
as predicted, I get a sine Like curve with
the face shift, or a cosine in some cases.

88
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,440
And you get [INAUDIBLE] in omega.

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,190
That's for the rates.

90
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,852
If you do the attitude motion,
this is the same thing.

91
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm just showing here all your angles.

92
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
Again, people, try to be diverse.

93
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,673
Something non-MRP.

94
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:22,510
We'll get to those a lot more later.

95
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,858
So what happens is, the attitude
motion is very difficult to predict.

96
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,950
So for torque-free motions,

97
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,630
the parts that are easy are the spin
parts with this equation.

98
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,340
And we can predict spin stability, but we
don't necessarily have pointing stability.

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,560
That's a whole nother thing.

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,526
And we'll get to that
in three-axis control.

101
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:45,728
But if you need spin stability, that's
where these kinds of analysis really help.
