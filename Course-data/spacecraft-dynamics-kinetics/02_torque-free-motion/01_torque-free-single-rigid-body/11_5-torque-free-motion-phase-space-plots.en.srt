1
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,929
What other insight do we have,

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,250
if we assume, as we did with the pole hold plots?

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,119
So without loss in generality, remember,

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,724
we can always flip the principal axis such that

5
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,745
the largest inertia is axis one,

6
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:20,260
intermediate inertia is axis two and the least inertia axis

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,164
is axis number three, right?

8
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:24,074
So, I assume this ordering.

9
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:26,695
Then, we found earlier the B's

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:28,870
for one and three had to be positive,

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,650
meaning they have very strong stability for large departures.

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,139
Here, that's negative, something we have to consider.

13
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,939
But intermediate axis, we know,

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,430
this one is always unstable, right?

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,240
That was the separatrix stuff, so not too surprising.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,530
It's actually linearly stable, nonlinearly unstable

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,630
and the other two's you don't have it defined.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,159
It depends on the situation,

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,270
on how you're doing that and how you tumbling it for

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,384
that, you know, the energy levels to get the right sign.

21
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:55,640
So, it's different ways we can do this.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,439
So, when you're looking at these systems for small departures,

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,119
we said, well, you know,

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,680
k times x is always going to be bigger close to x's around zero,

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,079
than another a times x is going to be bigger than b times x cubed

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,180
if x gets small enough.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,590
As x gets very very small, x cubed is even smaller, right,

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,799
whereas x is going to be bigger in that sense.

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,359
At some point, this magnitudes always

30
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,469
crisscross and as x gets large,

31
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:26,265
at some point, x cubed will dominate.

32
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,870
So, you can use these coefficients to argue

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,459
if you have a particular sign.

34
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,064
If A1 is positive, that means I've got a positive spring stiffness.

35
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:38,073
That omega one motion should stay nicely bounded and stable,

36
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,640
nice oscillatory part.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,000
If you have big departures and B is negative,

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,099
that means once you go too far from the origin,

39
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,094
it doesn't just oscillate at some point,

40
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:48,844
it's going to just take off to infinity.

41
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:50,784
That's what you find out in this analysis.

42
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:54,340
Or vice versa, if a is negative, that means, well,

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,325
it won't be stable.

44
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,049
Small departures drive you away from the origin,

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,629
but if B happens to be positive, in that case,

46
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,359
remember you can't have your x's then

47
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,935
go to infinity because at some point

48
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,494
x cubed is going to dominate

49
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,164
and it will try to bring it back.

50
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,710
And, in nonlinear system you get things called limit cycles,

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,409
and it doesn't converge to zero,

52
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,020
but these two terms fight each other

53
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,069
and you get these cyclic motions that happen in the end.

54
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,259
That's what it converges to.

55
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,090
So, the take off, this whole class is on nonlinear systems

56
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,925
that talk about these things.

57
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,299
So yeah, B1 can always be restoring if it's positive,

58
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,259
and we showed that.

59
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,324
Phase plane plots.

60
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:32,824
Let's talk about that.

61
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:35,330
Many of you have seen them, but not everybody,

62
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,764
not everybody's had quite an engineering background.

63
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:46,139
So, if I have a simple mx double dot plus kx system, all right,

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,965
what is a phase space plot?

65
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:51,639
What's on the horizontal axis?

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,150
Gamma x.

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,019
x.

68
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,330
And what's on the vertical axis?

69
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,274
x-dot, right?

70
00:02:58,274 --> 00:02:59,922
So you solve this.

71
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,145
So, after some math or numerically,

72
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:03,134
you find what

73
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,740
x is going to be, and you have

74
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,770
also a solution what x-dot is going to be.

75
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,990
If it's numerical, you could,

76
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,485
you know, you're always getting

77
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,659
your positions and your rates and you're integrating,

78
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,384
so you could keep track of all of that.

79
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,604
The phase space plot

80
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:17,324
is nothing but a visualization of my position and rates.

81
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:20,250
So, I'm not plotting it versus time, but I'm plotting

82
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,000
added positions and velocities compared themselves directly.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,205
So, if you have an oscillator equation

84
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,335
I give it an initial deflection here,

85
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,759
that's where I'm starting,

86
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,373
and I have a sinusoidal response, right?

87
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:34,175
Initially, I take the spring.

88
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:38,360
I deflect it and then I just gently let go.

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,684
The system would just oscillate, right?

90
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,719
What happens to the phase space plot?

91
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,223
What does that curve look like, for spring mass system?

92
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:47,810
Andrei.

93
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,650
Circle.

94
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,539
It's a circle, for this case, right?

95
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,189
So, at some point, this

96
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,814
potential energy goes into kinetic energy

97
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,085
right and then it slows down again.

98
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,210
And then, the net positions become negative

99
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,264
and then it becomes positive again and

100
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,580
you're just going to circle around, right?

101
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,913
If I give it less deflection,

102
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,860
you have a curve that does this.

103
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,615
If you give it more deflection,

104
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,659
you have bigger curves, right?

105
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,600
Do these curves ever intersect?

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,384
If you start here,

107
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:26,227
could this curve do this and go through here?

108
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:30,920
Then it's a different system.

109
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,211
If it's the same dynamical system,

110
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:37,855
can you have phase space lines intersect?

111
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,074
And the answer is really no.

112
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:43,204
The challenge with that, if they intercept,

113
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,910
if you had a different phase space plots, right?

114
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,100
It means if some curve does this and some other curve does this,

115
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,117
when you hit this intersection points which way do you go?

116
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,620
It's a second order dynamical system.

117
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,425
If I'm giving it a position velocity, the accelerations are

118
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,970
dictated by equations of motion.

119
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,154
You can't be going in two different directions.

120
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,454
Maybe unless you go on quantum stuff or something, you know.

121
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:09,790
But for classic mechanics systems, if given a position velocity,

122
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,589
there is a very distinct acceleration

123
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,069
and that velocity will evolve in a certain direction.

124
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,329
So, you don't typically see these lines intersect,

125
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,379
but you get these flow diagrams that you can draw,

126
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,779
and they will show you how the stuff evolves.

127
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,404
OK?

128
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:26,850
So, That's just a phase space, there should be a dot here.

129
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,799
That's what a phase space plot is.

130
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:38,780
With a phase space plot, let's still look at x double dot + kx,

131
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,550
just x double dot + the natural frequency squared x equal to zero.

132
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:54,875
What is an equilibria, no, actually that's not the one I'm looking for.

133
00:05:54,875 --> 00:06:04,514
Sin(x) equal to zero.

134
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,280
This is basically your planar

135
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,915
and normalized version of a planar pendulum.

136
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:11,180
That was this problem we're talking about earlier.

137
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,794
With this system, what are my equilibriums going to be?

138
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:25,352
When is x doubled dot and x dot gonna go to zero?

139
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:29,610
If what?

140
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,488
When is x double dot gonna be zero?

141
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:36,470
That's the easy one.

142
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,360
Zero and 180.

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,319
Thank you.

144
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,410
So, if, x is equal to zero or pi.

145
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,230
So, on a phase space plot, plus or minus pi, right,

146
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,000
because you can go upside down this way or this way,

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,295
and if it hangs straight down, let's call that zero.

148
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:54,404
Right?

149
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:56,420
We know if we linearize this,

150
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,355
it's just x double dot plus x,

151
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,620
and you guys were arguing earlier, in that case,

152
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,995
around the equilibrium,

153
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:04,295
that's at the zero equilibrium

154
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:08,949
I would have something where my phase space plots look like circles.

155
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:09,975
Alright?

156
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,249
And they have a certain direction.

157
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,170
But if you go here,

158
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,545
and you'd linearize around that.

159
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:19,779
Here, you'd end up with x double dot equal to minus x,

160
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,154
x double dot minus x is equal to zero,

161
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,699
which gives you negative stiffness,

162
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,129
and it's actually hyperbolically unstable.

163
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,607
So there's these asymptotes you can draw,

164
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,384
and that's good for both of them.

165
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,220
So as we have larger departures,

166
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,410
these phase space plots can all look like this.

167
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,704
And, if you're on these lines,

168
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,490
you would do weird stuff,

169
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,694
where you could tumble from one with enough speed

170
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,759
and hit the, you know,

171
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,160
you can go from here and give it enough initial speed

172
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,944
to where you would hit over here again,

173
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,914
and do different kinds of motions, right?

174
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,879
But, that's what these phase space look like,

175
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,954
so you can quickly identify equilibriums.

176
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:54,834
If you do this and there's programs that will give you this flow,

177
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,110
the phase space flow, and you will see the dead spots.

178
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,139
Those are the equilibriums and around it,

179
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,165
the flows visually very quickly tell you this looks stable

180
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:05,095
neighboring stuff or no neighboring.

181
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:08,144
Some of it comes in, other stuff goes crazy, right?

182
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:12,445
So, that's my quick review, if you haven't seen phase space plots.

183
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:17,970
So, these kind of things with linear and cubic part can be used for that, as well.

184
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,550
So this is one of the phase space plots we could talk about,

185
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,870
where they flow.

186
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,324
Omega's nearby, those omega two's look good,

187
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,920
but then there's a limiting case, as well.

188
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,879
And it turns out, with this omega two this was the separatrix case,

189
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,809
but that was the intermediate axis case.

190
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,509
There's a limit.

191
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,951
If I'm doing a pure spin about omega two,

192
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:39,750
that's one of the conditions, and then anything inside is

193
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,419
a non-pure spin about the intermediate axis,

194
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,139
and you can, it turns out, you can show,

195
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,384
this paper showed, I'm not doing that in class.

196
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,799
But there's different limiting conditions

197
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,014
that they can come up with,

198
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,904
physical motions can never be outside here.

199
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,315
You have to be within this arc.

200
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,545
You can never actually exceed initial conditions.

201
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:03,970
It will give you nonphysical initial states that you'd have to have to get there.
