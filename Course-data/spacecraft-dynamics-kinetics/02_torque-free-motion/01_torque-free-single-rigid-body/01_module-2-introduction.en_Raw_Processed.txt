hi welcome to second 
segment spacecraft kinetics 
here, going to looking 
torque free motion rigid bodies 
we start a single rigid body 
study this actually 
will evolve time 
spin change 
this is coupled 
to gyroscopics 
we will study this 
several different methods 
one is called portal 
a cool graphical way actually 
to study large scale motions 
certain spins stable unstable 
also going to looking 
different specialized analytic answers 
we consider things like 
axisymmetric bodies that special 
answers bodies that 
distinct inertias like this box here, 
we go to skinny, intermediate, 
maximum edge 
youll answer questions like is this 
spin less stable, while if you 
spin intermediate 
axis, youll find flips quickly 
so going to show results 
in end, 
going to look dual spinner, 
another passive way 
to stabilize an object 
so while certain spin orientations 
single body unstable, 
a double body system, we 
actually stabilize axes 
we go mathematics 
developing equations motion, 
looking equilibria, 
discussing stability
