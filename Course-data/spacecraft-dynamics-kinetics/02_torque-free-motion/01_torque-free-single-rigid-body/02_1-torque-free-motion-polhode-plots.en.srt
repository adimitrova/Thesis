1
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:09,716
And what we're going to do next is we're
going to spend a little bit of time,

2
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:12,741
at least two lectures, talking about
torque free motion, because for

3
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,920
spacecraft this is
a pretty common situation.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,030
You're not always thrusting.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,360
You're not always reacting, because you're
using lots of resources, energy, fuel.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,820
So how do we understand
torque free motion.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,360
In fact there's many missions that exploit
torque free motions to spin stabilize or

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,860
do all kinds of stuff.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,070
And then we'll look at some
disturbances like gravity gradients,

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,820
we'll derive that from scratch using
very much the same kind of notation.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,390
And dual spinners, that's another one.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,550
And then we'll jump into
the control stuff afterwards.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,415
Okay, so I didn't

14
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:49,690
put that one off.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:57,070
Let's talk about torque-free
attitude motion.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,820
As we've been saying today,
H dot is equal to L.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,370
If it's torque-free
the L just becomes zero.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,820
That says the nerve, whatever this
vector is, H is just a vector in space.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,204
And a vector has a magnitude
times a direction.

20
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:16,279
All we're saying with H dot equal to L
is that as seen by an inertial observer,

21
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,190
this vector is fixed.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,350
So that means, what you just seen before,
H is equal to I omega, we compute

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,850
all this stuff, we have I in the body
frame, we have omega in the body frame.

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,090
We very often write H is equal
to something, something,

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,490
something in the body frame.

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,540
The body frame components of H for
torque free motion are not zero.

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,970
The inertias are fixed, but the omegas
are going to vary, go back and forth.

28
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,560
But if you reconstruct in the body frame,

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,780
this is what the vector is,
now you know what the body attitude is.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,870
So times BN, right.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,320
You map it back into the end frame.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,960
Those, the three inertia frame
components have to be fixed.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,638
And that's essentially
what we're doing here.

34
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,640
This is in the body frame.

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,390
This is typically how we write it.

36
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,460
Here we've assumed what type of
body frame to get this form.

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,450
Principle, exactly.

38
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,420
Now it's diagonal.

39
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,690
We'll do this a lot for analysis.

40
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,280
We can always do this for anybody.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,120
It just simplifies our basic stability
analysis that we're looking at.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,930
So that we do that.

43
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,000
Then times some DCM in
whatever coordinates you wish.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,850
Some people that use
something besides MRP.

45
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,260
I just want to highlight that.

46
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,200
That does happen.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,120
So you get this and
now you have to take the derivative.

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,260
This is only the N frame components.

49
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,070
Now you have to take the derivative of
all this stuff and set it equal to zero.

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,710
And you get a lot of theta one dots and

51
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,490
omega dots and yeah that has to be
true but what do I do with this dots.

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,760
It's not very insightful.

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,000
So that's this is
fundamentally what happens.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,350
So this is a good test if
you're writing an integrator

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,410
because you give it initial attitude.

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,380
Give it a spin.

57
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,990
No torque.

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,820
Set the torque to zero and
that equations of motion let it tumble.

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,770
Let it spin and
you watch the attitude history.

60
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,310
And at every time step,
if you compute this.

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,130
From the attitude computed DCN,

62
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,640
map your momentum coordinates from
the body into the inertial frame,

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,290
you should have three coordinates
that give you perfect flat lines.

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,580
If they do that,

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,010
then you get really warm fuzzy feelings
that your integrator is working.

66
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,640
It's not a guarantee that you get
warm fuzzy feelings something.

67
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,150
There's always ways people can
get creative and screw things up.

68
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,630
But, if you preserve momentum
in the inertial frame

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,850
that's a really good indicator
you're on the right track.

70
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,520
It's good for numerical checks,
it's not good for analysis.

71
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,080
So the next step is now for
analytical insight.

72
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,530
How do we look at this stuff.

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,850
So really, the key component is we want
to do everything in the body frame.

74
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,330
It helps us.

75
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,680
And we want to look at, we want to
make use that momentum is preserved.

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,798
If we're doing torque free motion is there
something else that preserved as well.

77
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,993
[COUGH].

78
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,683
Any momentum.

79
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,210
Yes, Spencer, energy actually.

80
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,900
Do you remember the power equation T dot.

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,550
Ended up being omega dotted with l,
and at l0.

82
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,780
That was one of the cases,
how we can get 0 power on the system.

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,844
So [INAUDIBLE] has to
be preserved as well.

84
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:11,585
That's a result we'll jump into next.

85
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,170
So if you do everything in the body frame,
H was equal to i omega.

86
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,859
Omega, in the body frame is
the classic omega one b one,

87
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,909
omega two b two, and so forth.

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,250
If you just take in the h vector and
putting it in body frames,

89
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,678
I'm just using h one, H two, H three.

90
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:31,620
That's just my labels of the b
frame components of the H vector.

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,510
And I omega means H one
must be I one omega one.

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,740
That's that first vector component of H,

93
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,580
because I'm using a principle frame
now that has diagonalised my stuff.

94
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,730
She is saying okay,
good where we going with this.

95
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,670
It's written age or in the body frame.

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,060
Now instead of using just
a re-written version of the prior

97
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,100
slide what we're going to do next is
instead of saying all three in actual

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,880
vector component have to be constant,
nice flat lines when you plot them out,

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,970
we're just going to
focus on the magnitude.

100
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,220
because the magnitude is a scalar.

101
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,272
And as we discussed in the first week,

102
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:15,944
to take a derivative of a scalar
doesn't have a framed dependency.

103
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:18,812
So if H as a vector is
constant in the frame,

104
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:22,104
that must mean it's magnitude
has to be constant as well.

105
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:22,820
And therefore,

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,709
the magnitude is something I can always
compute even in body frame components.

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,090
So that's a nice trick.

108
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,940
We go, okay, how do we get the magnitude.

109
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,450
Well, we're going to get the magnitude
squared by just dotting H with itself.

110
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,060
Or in a matrix form we do H transpose H.

111
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,750
Same math, gives you the same stuff.

112
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,439
So this times itself just gives you I one
squared, omega one squared, I two squared,

113
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,560
omega two squared.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,580
And you start adding them up.

115
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,890
And all of this has to
give you a constant.

116
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,990
Because whatever spin you gave the system
whatever gyrations are going on

117
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,480
these things have to add up.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Omega ones twos and
threes can vary with time but

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,020
they have to add up to give you the same
number in the end same momentum.

120
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,010
So good this gives me one equation.

121
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,060
Kinetic energy was the other
one that we talked about.

122
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,630
If you look at kinetic energy that was
one half omega transpose i omega, and

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,210
if I is diagonal it really
simplifies very quickly.

124
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,120
And you end up with one half
inertia rate squared for

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,110
each of the principle axis, that's it.

126
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,340
But energy is also preserved.

127
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,420
So you notice in these two equations, the
independent coordinates are the omegas.

128
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,660
And giving it an initial spin, and
I know the omegas, my rates, can change.

129
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,790
But that gives me three degrees of freedom
for the rates, subject to two constraints.

130
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,590
Momentum magnitude has to be fixed.

131
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,350
Energy has to be fixed.

132
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,330
So in the end Jordan, two constraints,
three degrees of freedom,

133
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,070
how many degrees of
freedom are you left with.

134
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,360
One, right.

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,210
So that means immediately,
once we have top free motion,

136
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,340
the Omega time history has become down to
a single curve in three dimensional space.

137
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,810
It's a one B sub space
that we have to find.

138
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,410
And so right now looking at this how
do we intercept this, and this, and

139
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,470
predict how that behaves.

140
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,200
This is not quite geometrically intuitive.

141
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,120
That's where the next stuff comes.

142
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,740
Let me go back here.

143
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,710
Could somebody tell me.

144
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,870
Just replace omega one,
two and three with X, Y and

145
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,550
Z as your three coordinates
that we're tracking.

146
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,260
If you have AX squared plus BX

147
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,920
squared plus Y squared plus CZ
squared equal to a constant.

148
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,850
What type of shape are you describing.

149
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,550
>> Okay, not a circle because this
is a three dimensional shape.

150
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,425
It's not a sphere.

151
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,440
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> A, B, and C are different.

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,660
If A, B, and
C were the same it would ge a sphere.

153
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,140
So what is the shape then.

154
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,960
>> Ellipsoid.

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,250
>> It's an ellipsoid that you actually,
this is a classic equation for

156
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,240
the surface of an ellipsoid.

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,640
So that means, this is kind of like stuff,

158
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,610
where we have this 4d hyper sphere,
that's hard to visualize.

159
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,100
A 3d surface, I can draw, so
we'll see visualizations of this.

160
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,100
But this equation actually
means that your solutions for

161
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,359
omega 1, 2, 3, reside on this ellipsoid.

162
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,682
Does the ellipsoid have a constant shape,
or does it change its shape with time?

163
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:28,007
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Why?

164
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:34,670
>> Because its x,y, and
z parameters [INAUDIBLE] over time?

165
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,211
>> X, y, and
z are your independent coordinates.

166
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,030
Let's look at that.

167
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,250
Too much fire, okay.

168
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,410
If we have this, this is more of a classic
way, you might see this ellipsoid and

169
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,690
that's some constant,
right Is this an ellipse?

170
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,584
If a, b, and c are just constants is
this an ellipse of a fixed shape,

171
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,917
or is this ellipse varying with size?

172
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,624
>> Fixed shape.

173
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:08,860
>> Fixed shape, right?

174
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,500
And so here we just have
a lot of coordinates that.

175
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,850
Where people get quickly confused is
what is the independent stuff that

176
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,390
we're looking at.

177
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,990
So the omegas would be independent things,
like x, y and z.

178
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,762
You see in the classic ellipsoidal,
Wiki notes or something.

179
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,143
I1, 2 and 3, those are principle inertias
that are fixed in time because we have

180
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:26,738
a rigid body.

181
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:29,875
If these weren't rigid,
these would not be fixed things.

182
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,025
And we'll see that actually with dual
spinners, so you have multiple buttons.

183
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:36,765
Same thing here,
this also will make a squared y.

184
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:40,295
So that's x squared y squared
z squared times some constant

185
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:41,950
equals to something that's constant.

186
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,960
This is also an ellipse, so
that that George was talking about right,

187
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,470
that's the space we
are actually looking for.

188
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,630
We have two constraints,
this is an ellipse, that's an ellipse.

189
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,770
This two has to be intercepted and that's
the answer, and that's not very intuitive,

190
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,180
it's not easy to intercept
two ellipsis to.

191
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,890
So people came up with
this other approach.

192
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,410
Instead of treating omega one, two, three,

193
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,940
as the independent coordinates we're
trying to figure out what's happening.

194
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,260
We use scaled versions of omega one,
two, three.

195
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,460
Basically you multiply in times of
principle inertias so the new independent

196
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,360
coordinates are simply your body frame
angular momentum vector components.

197
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
So I'm treating H1, 2, 3s.

198
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,810
I can find H1, 2, 3 time histories,
and then to map them back to omegas,

199
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,450
all I do is divide them by the principal
inertias and you get omegas again.

200
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,632
But if you do this, and you get momentum,
constraint looks like this,

201
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,873
what type of geometric shape is this?

202
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,616
This is a sphere, all right,

203
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:45,330
it's basically constants equal to x
square plus y square plus z square.

204
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,110
So this is definitely a sphere,
that's easy to draw, as you will see.

205
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,630
And then the energy constraint,

206
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,960
in terms of this,
I will let you do this on your own.

207
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,070
You just have to plug in that h1
is i1 omega1, yeah we arrange it

208
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,130
you end up getting the energy constraint
of divided by t gives you this.

209
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,320
This is kind of a classic normalized
forward where the ellipsoidal

210
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,240
form is something old square equal to one.

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,480
And then this these terms if you go look
up ellipsoids which you could do easily.

212
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,917
These become related to your semi-minor,
semi-intermediate, and

213
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:22,200
semi-major axes of that ellipsoid
that you're going to have, right?

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,590
This is just a unit, not a unit sphere.

215
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,810
It's a sphere of size H, and then you
get these energies that come in there,

216
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,428
and this is something we
can start to put together.

217
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,170
So for torque-free motion,

218
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,610
to consider what happens to the rates over
time as you're jumbling and tirading for

219
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,010
anybody, this is nothing cylindrical or
symmetric, it's any inertias.

220
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,850
These are the two constraints, we've
moved from Omega space to h space, and

221
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,390
that gave us a simpler way to
geometrically find these things.

222
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,970
So that's a sphere, and
this is the classic ellipsoidal equations,

223
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,490
that you can find your a, bs and cs.

224
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,600
Which are you're semi-axes for

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,920
the three things, so yep,
that's what you can find there.

226
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,294
So we'll have three,
if we have three distinct inertias,

227
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:13,500
you will have three distinct axis, and

228
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,650
a key element again is well let's see,
can t vary on a spacecraft?

229
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,952
I'm full of simple questions this morning.

230
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:32,709
Torque-free motion,
there's no external torque

231
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,758
acting on a spacecraft,
could t vary, ansel?

232
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,030
>> Yeah.

233
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,828
>> Could h vary?

234
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:42,129
If it's torque-free, no external
force acting on the spacecraft?

235
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,610
You don't think so,
you guessing, you feeling lucky?

236
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,340
>> H = L, it goes back to that.

237
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,400
Is that good for a rigid body?

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,550
Yes, is it good for a continuum?

239
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,420
Yeah, so if you have the spacecraft
it's not rigid, it has fuel slosh.

240
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,870
It has people wandering around in there,
it's a space station.

241
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,300
It has big panels that can flex,
space station again, huge panels right?

242
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,710
H dot equal to l still holds,

243
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,980
if there's no external torque acting
on the system, H has to be preserved.

244
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,970
So for all the torque-free motions,
we always treat H as a constant.

245
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,030
That's religion, I mean,
it doesn't change, t, though, the energy.

246
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,040
We say this is rigid, but

247
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,180
how rigid is any structure,
everything has a little bit of flex.

248
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,760
There's always something,
maybe very stiff, but

249
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,169
there is always some amount of flexing.

250
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,630
So as soon as you flex,
what happens mechanically?

251
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,330
What happens to your energy state?

252
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah, you're going to
start dissipating energy.

253
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,070
There's always a resistance to flexing and
there's some damping coefficient.

254
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,500
It might be really, really small but

255
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,798
if internal friction there's stuff
rubbing against ach other there.

256
00:13:57,798 --> 00:14:00,950
There's walls, there's always
friction ways to dissipate energy, so

257
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,940
even though it might be almost rigid and
you now nothing is truly rigid.

258
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,640
So in practice in this math we are
assuming right now it's perfectly rigid

259
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,490
but that's an artefact of our mathematics.

260
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,660
In real life as an engineer we
realize nothing is perfectly rigid,

261
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,486
in fact what was the first satellite
that went up for the U.S.?

262
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:19,482
>> Explorer 1.

263
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:20,800
>> Explorer.

264
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,500
How did explorer 1 do?

265
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,740
It was kind of in this shape, they go hey,

266
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,890
we looked at this equations and
if we spin about this axis.

267
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,230
I heard spinning stabilizes things,
so they spun about this axis right?

268
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,120
Had big antenna sticking out,
that's how they communicated.

269
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,740
Those antenna were all flopping,

270
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,740
doing stuff, anybody remember how
long before it went unstable?

271
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,829
It was less than an orbit, bery glorious.

272
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,390
After that they started to listen
to astrodynamicist they go

273
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,060
to help if you do it by the right axis and
the right stuff, and all right?

274
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,400
So that was one because it is flexing
it definitely lost energy and

275
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,780
you will see here shortly why
with all these constraints.

276
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,220
This leads to something that can
be very unstable, actually, and

277
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,210
what does it move towards?

278
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,830
There's definite stable equilibrium,
but it's not this spin,

279
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,160
where you're spinning about this nice
symmetry axis, the skinny one, right?

280
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,090
So energy can vary,
that means, momentum doesn't,

281
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,710
if it's torque-free,
our momentum sphere is locked.

282
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,400
But for that amount of momentum there is
a finite range of energies that you can

283
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,690
have, this ellipsoid has
to intercept with momentum.

284
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,320
So there's a minimum energy
state you can have, and

285
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,950
there's a maximum energy
state you can have.

286
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,110
So just because you have a fixed amount
of momentum you cannot predict what

287
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,770
the actual energy state is.

288
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,700
There's a range of energies you can have
as we dissipate energy we go from one to

289
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,710
another on our own.

290
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,290
What happens though as we change energy,

291
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,120
you can see it's 2x the principle inertia
x the energy it takes square root.

292
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,210
As energy scales, it's going to
scale all of my axes simultaneously.

293
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,270
So this ellipsoid, basically,
grows homogeneously or

294
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,450
shrinks homogeneously with energy.

295
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,690
As you change energy, you don't just make
this ellipsoid longer in one direction and

296
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,920
skinnier in another.

297
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,190
It just grows and scales evenly.

298
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,210
Right?
That's the key

299
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,509
thing you want to get
out of this equation.

300
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,010
Good, now, let's look at this.

301
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,890
This is my first of many figures.

302
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,960
We're going to assume,
without loss in generality,

303
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,790
that our principal in our body frame,
the principal frame,

304
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,730
it's lined up such that B1
gives Axis of maximum inertia.

305
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,510
That would be like kind of like
this axis here on this box.

306
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,420
Then you have B2 is axis
of intermediate inertia.

307
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,790
That's the one in-between.

308
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,600
That would be this
kind of a skinnier side.

309
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,270
And then axis of least inertia is here.

310
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,500
As we said Principal frames
is to find that permutation.

311
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,530
I can always choose a frame
where this is true.

312
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,220
So, I don't have to do this
math six different ways.

313
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,160
I can just do it once.

314
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,280
And you can flip your
frames when if needed.

315
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,900
And now we're plotting these
things in momentum corner space.

316
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,060
Not omega space but
we realize that omega 2 omega H,

317
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,930
sorry H3 H2 Are just omega 1 times I1 and
so forth.

318
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,310
The momentum shows up as a sphere,
that's nice.

319
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,500
The ellipsoid shows up here,
and it has to intercept.

320
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,290
So, we said earlier we've got three
coordinates we're looking for, omega 1,

321
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,030
2, 3, subject to two constraints.

322
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,220
The answer must be a curve.

323
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,480
And that's where our curve is.

324
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
Is that the only intersection?

325
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,460
>> There's one I'm not showing.

326
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,300
It's on the backside.

327
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,800
Thank you.
>> [LAUGH]

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,900
>> So, even here, so

329
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,340
if you have energy specified and

330
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,050
momentum specified, there's actually two
possible trajectories you could be on.

331
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,780
They're related.

332
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,430
They're kind of mirror images.

333
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,310
But the shape isn't flat,
this is kind of potato-shaped.

334
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,840
Things, ellipsoid, but
wrapped around a sphere,

335
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,340
that's what the intersection
curve looks like.

336
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,940
And that's what you would have.

337
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,140
And here you would wobble
around in this direction,

338
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,810
over there it's in this direction.

339
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,300
So, this gives you something,
this scale body inertia,

340
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,380
you can tell right away,
this is where my omegas have to reside.

341
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
This can also be used as
an integration check.

342
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,830
So now we can play with energy levels and

343
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,320
start to look at different spin conditions
and also talk about stability of these.

344
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,260
So, I know, those of you taking 3200,
you've seen these slides before.

345
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,350
So, then we'll quickly go to new stuff.

346
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,320
With H, let's look at
the smallest Ellipse you can do.

347
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,800
If you shrink your energy then
remember these axes are proportional

348
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,710
to the principal inertias so this axis b1
that has the largest principal inertia.

349
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,880
It's the longest elongation.

350
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,330
If you shrink the ellipsis small as you
can make it, the longest elongation is

351
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,250
going to be the only point that just
barely touches the momentum sphere.

352
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,580
That's kind of the geometric
interpretation.

353
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,510
So that means,
what kind of spin do you have?

354
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,870
That's a single intersection point here or
here.

355
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,470
So that means, in this case,

356
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,550
you have a spin that's doing
either you're rotating positive or

357
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,219
negative about your B1 axis, but you're
doing a pure spin about a principle axis.

358
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,940
And so in this case here,
actually it would wobble and

359
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,920
you'd be spinning this case that way.

360
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,440
So H2 and 3 are 0 because you only have
an H1 axis intercept, that's there.

361
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,770
And you plug it back into the equations,
in the kinetic equations.

362
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,970
And in the end, if you have H and
the principle inertias,

363
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,749
you can compute with this what
that minimum energy state is.

364
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,680
So, there's a Clementine Mission that
went to the moon, very successful.

365
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,440
It was one of the first ones that
found signs of potential water,

366
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,940
ice kind of in the shadowy parts
of the polar craters of the moon.

367
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,530
Then after we was going to go off and
visit some asteroid or comet or something.

368
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,399
And along the way they had a slight
glitch where all of the sudden

369
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:57,374
the thrusters were told to be on and stay
on just because until you run out of fuel.

370
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,757
It wasn't just all the thrusters, maybe it
was balanced, it was more like there's one

371
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:07,120
thing went on, and so it spun up to
a crazy momentum and the mission was over.

372
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,550
Now, it's torp free It's still,
probably whatever is flexing

373
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,810
going on in the structure might still
be dissipating energy but it will never

374
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,910
ever come to rest unless you have some
external force acting on the system.

375
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,220
You need an external torque to change
a total angle momentum, all right.

376
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,480
So even with damping in the system
that you have fuel slosh,

377
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,690
it'll dissipate it but
it can only dissipate it down.

378
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,200
to this, that's the limiting case.

379
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,400
Any lower energy that ellipsoid and
the sphere don't intersect.

380
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,530
You're violating momentum.

381
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,020
Now you've changed
momentum of the system and

382
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,510
we must have applied an external force.

383
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,590
Maybe SRPs could do some of this stuff.

384
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,360
That's one thing we do with
space debris tracking.

385
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,920
SRPs Atmospheric drag.

386
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,670
I'm looking at electrostatic drag forces,
as well, and torques.

387
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,210
They can change momentum over time,

388
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,190
which really complicates
the analysis of the objects.

389
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,000
But, this is one of them.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,290
So, good.
Do you think this is going to be stable?

391
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,130
This is an equilibrium spin.

392
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,980
That means, if I put my body in this
condition my omega 2, and 3 are 0.

393
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,900
If you go back to look at the other
differential equations, what you end

394
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,740
up getting is omega 1 data zero or
omega 2 data zero, or omega 3 data zero.

395
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,250
All right, let's actually look at,
let me just go back a few.

396
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:31,230
Here we go.

397
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,890
If Omega 2 And omega 3 are 0,
while 2 times 3, that's all 0.

398
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,320
0 times something is 0, something
times 0 is 0, and torques are all 0.

399
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,960
You can see a pure spin about b1
is going to be in equilibrium,

400
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
where all the omegas are 0, right?

401
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,300
So good.

402
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,770
So we found that.

403
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,540
Now we want to know,
is this going to be a stable equilibrium.

404
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,670
So if I take this object,

405
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,480
and I do a pure spin about this, I'm never
going to physically give it a pure spin.

406
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,090
I'm just not that good.

407
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,130
All right?

408
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm always off by a smidgen.

409
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,800
So, stability is always well.

410
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,460
This particular spin rate would be perfect
to give you zero rates in everything.

411
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,400
But if you're off by a little bit,
are you going to stay close?

412
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,870
Or is that going to drive it upside down?

413
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,770
Gravity gradient is the easy example,
right?

414
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,890
Here, like this kind of a pendulum
would be stable, if I do this,

415
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,050
anyhow, it keeps wobbling,
then have friction,

416
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,960
it just keeps wobbling here to
stay close versus this one.

417
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,420
This is in equilibrium.

418
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,450
But if I wouldn't hold it tight and I'm
off by a little bit, it drives it away.

419
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,590
That's an unstable one, all right?

420
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,780
Here, if we have neighboring motion,
we can't make energy any smaller,

421
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,240
we wouldn't intercept.

422
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,770
So we just make energy slightly bigger,
what happens to the interception curves?

423
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,650
Do they stay tight and
bounded around that equilibrium?

424
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,760
Louis?

425
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,370
Yes, everything looks rounded.

426
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,270
>> So, if you make it a little bit bigger,
you would think, okay,

427
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,050
you've got this little
bit of a curve there.

428
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,290
Okay, you're wobbling some.

429
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,770
If you're not doing a fierce spin,
you would wobble some.

430
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,960
And we see that, right?

431
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,130
If you take this object and
I take it here and spin it,

432
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,085
that spun pretty well, no biggie.

433
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:14,400
Let's see So I've got some videos here.

434
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,220
Same inertias, I'm showing an object
that kind of scales with these inertias.

435
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm giving it a sphere spin,
which would be in equilibrium.

436
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,030
I should never see it wobble by other
axis, it's just doing that pure B1 spin.

437
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,220
Here I'm giving it some slight
offsets with half a degree, and

438
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,060
you can see, they look almost identical.

439
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,980
They are not perfectly identical but
they stay,

440
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,630
these little wobbles they stay very small
and bounded and life behaves well,right?

441
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,370
Which kind of makes sense because
we're doing deviations about a minimum

442
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,150
energy states.

443
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,210
And as you've often learned in physics,
nature loves minimum energy.

444
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,490
Everything kind of converges
to minimum energy state.

445
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,110
Right, that's the stable
one That we would have.

446
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,760
So, that's this spin.

447
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,120
If we now look at intermediate energy,
we increase our energy, right?

448
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,570
Everything scales evenly, now of a sudden,

449
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,280
the intermediate access which is
along B2 intercepts You would have

450
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,070
a pure spin about this point,
or a pure spin about the other.

451
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,633
That means when these object were
spinning about this axis in a positive or

452
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,383
negative set.

453
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:18,228
Those are the two options if you
have this specific energy state.

454
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:22,049
And as before, you said H1 and
H3 equal to 0.

455
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,790
And then, you can quickly solve that
intermediate energy state is momentum

456
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,255
squared over 2 times
the intermediate inertia.

457
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:32,740
If you have that energy state, these
are the two points you could be spinning.

458
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,190
But it's not the intersection
line isn't just 2 points,

459
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,870
like with the minimum energy state.

460
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,560
There's also this whole
curve that happens,

461
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,410
it's a saddle point that
wraps around itself.

462
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,800
That is a physical motion as well, and
that's called the separatrix motion.

463
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,680
So if you're spinning nearly about it,
now, if I do a pure spin here, I'm good.

464
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,740
That should give me just a spin,
but is that one going to be stable?

465
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,505
If you're off slightly, if you're not just
on this point, but we increase energy.

466
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,351
And all of a sudden you're at
a point slightly above it up here.

467
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:14,551
Are you going to stay close,
With these things?

468
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:17,523
What do you think?

469
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:20,658
No, right?

470
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:25,115
So this curve actually takes you
from here, then back over here.

471
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:29,853
Here it comes in, so the question is if
you're on this curve, well, wait a minute.

472
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:33,049
If I hit this point, do I go this way or
that way, what happens?

473
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,550
The answer is you never hit that point.

474
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,760
Those spin conditions, you can put
yourself on it mathematically perfectly.

475
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,076
But if you're on the separatrix motion,

476
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:44,799
you will get there with
infinite amount of time.

477
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,685
It's an asymptote, right?

478
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:50,569
Otherwise mathematically you can see you
have a decision point all of a sudden does

479
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:51,870
the stuff go left or right?

480
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,032
And that never happens,
because you just asymptotically,

481
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,746
it would take an infinite amount of
time to actually reach that point.

482
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:57,674
And who is that patient?

483
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,370
So if you're off slightly,

484
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,305
you will see interception lines
that kind of look like this.

485
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:06,575
But anytime I get close to
this interception point,

486
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:09,905
that's when I know this actually
takes a long, long, long time.

487
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:10,805
It'll hang out there,

488
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,745
and then, eventually,
it goes back over to the other side.

489
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:14,635
This is why,

490
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:19,830
if you try to flip an object about
the axis of intermediate inertia, right?

491
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,770
It flipped, and now it didn't,
there we go, it flipped again, and

492
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,790
it flipped again.

493
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,685
In one twist and I'm not trying hard,
it immediately does 180, 180, 180.

494
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:32,940
It's very unstable in that sense, right?

495
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,850
That becomes because of
these kinds of behaviors.

496
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,640
So, intermediate axis
spins are never stable.

497
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,480
They're highly unstable,
but they may be deceiving.

498
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,540
They may look stable for
a short period of time.

499
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,112
So, let's see if I can
get this video to work.

500
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,236
Went through the commercial.

501
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:56,738
Let's see if YouTube is going to do this.

502
00:26:56,738 --> 00:27:00,933
This is on the space station, they have
an object, they took it and they spun it.

503
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:04,707
Why is it doing this motion?

504
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:09,885
>> That's so cool [LAUGH].

505
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,848
It's perturbed very slightly and goes on.

506
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:14,405
>> It's definitely a spin
as they're doing it here,

507
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:17,084
this is a spin about the axis
of inner median inertia.

508
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,545
But there's a little bit of a wobble,
it's not a perfect spin.

509
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,647
I guess astronauts aren't
that well trained, all right?

510
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:24,418
>> [LAUGH]
>> So, this is hard to do, but

511
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:25,292
you can see.

512
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:28,270
For short periods of time,
it almost looks stable, right?

513
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,950
It gets close and
it stays close, then crap.

514
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,120
All hell breaks loose, right?

515
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,770
And you flip upside down again,
and then you hang out for awhile.

516
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,518
No, YouTube, thank you,
who knows what it's going to show us.

517
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:42,490
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay, but it goes back and

518
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,080
forth, yep, you can stop.

519
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,790
So that's what's happening here.

520
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,412
You can see, it looks stable for
short periods of time, but

521
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:55,613
it's getting close to here,
hangs out for a while.

522
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:58,548
But then, eventually, it's going to
get over here and then hang out for

523
00:27:58,548 --> 00:27:59,970
a while and then come back.

524
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,440
It never settles at one point,
that's why it's not stable.

525
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
You may look like you're staying close for
a finite period of time.

526
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,030
But as we go through, later on,
the control proof, or the stable mean,

527
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,950
and so forth.

528
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,830
Once you enter a bounded region,
you have to remain in that region forever,

529
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,350
and you will not.

530
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,720
because if you're off, you may stay there
for 10,000 years, because you got really,

531
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,010
really, really, really close.

532
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,300
But eventually you will, you give it
enough time, you will bounce back.

533
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,790
And it will go off to the other side.

534
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,267
Hang out for a while and then come back.

535
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:31,170
So that's kind of a really cool video,
I like that one.

536
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,030
It kind of illustrates what's happening,
right?

537
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,390
This is where you're going one direction,

538
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,070
and then it floats around and
comes back here.

539
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,120
And, except for the air drag in that space
station, it's really a torque-free motion.

540
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,260
And it's just bouncing back and
forth satisfying, this stuff.

541
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,200
This is actually what
leads to chaos as well.

542
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,440
So with a single rigid body,

543
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,080
he can proof completely rigorous
mathematic that this is a chaotic system.

544
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,632
If you're spinning nearly around
a separatrix kind of energy state.

545
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,180
because a infinitesimal change
here has you spinning this way.

546
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,142
And another one has you spinning this way,
which is different orientations.

547
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:08,820
And so infinite sensitivity to small
changes is what redefines chaos.

548
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,323
And so separatrix motions is
a chaotic type of motion.

549
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,562
So you see all kinds of
papers published on it.

550
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:15,887
So chaos is fun, here we look at it,

551
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:20,160
I've just done a minor minor [INAUDIBLE],
again 0.5 degrees.

552
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,920
And even after less than one revolution,
hugely different orientations, right?

553
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,760
That's what you're seeing
when you flip this thing and

554
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,930
let it spin and its already tumbled.

555
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,300
So definitely unstable,
let's see what's the maximum energy state.

556
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,740
If you scale this ellipse
as big as you can,

557
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,768
you end up with this kind of a huge
ellipse, it still has to intercept.

558
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:44,986
And that's going to be now at
the polar points, the b3 axis.

559
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:48,162
So this is a pure spin about
to axis of least inertia,

560
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,830
because that's how we define b3.

561
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,470
And that would be this, and
so if I try to spin this,

562
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,690
it's reasonably stable,
it's just an awkward way to spin it.

563
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,290
Little bit of a tumble,
but it looks stable.

564
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,531
Again, you make your other Other 2, 0.

565
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:10,954
Now from this term, you can derive energy
is h squared over 2, minimum inertia.

566
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:11,798
That makes sense,

567
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,465
you divide by the smallest inertia to
get the biggest energy state, right?

568
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:19,025
So that's the maximum energy you could
have with this amount of momentum.

569
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,495
To have any more, you have to apply
external torques and increase your sphere.

570
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:26,330
But you intercept at 2 points,
which is good.

571
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,240
Now, here, if you have,
we can't have more energy.

572
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,581
That's a maximum energy state,
if we have slightly less, Nathan,

573
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,724
is that motion going to be stable or
unstable?

574
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:35,606
>> Unstable.

575
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:36,558
>> Why?

576
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,890
>> Because it'll go to the minimum.

577
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,270
>> Why?

578
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,730
>> because it's going to lose some energy,
it's going to dissipate some energy.

579
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,680
>> If you don't consider energy loss,
and this was really Explorer 1,

580
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,920
how bad could it be?

581
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,172
Really, it's just a little dappy,
nothing, it's very small, right?

582
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:55,100
So without energy loss, if you're like
this, that's exactly what Explorer 1 was

583
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,990
doing, spinning about
the skinny axis of the rocket.

584
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,740
They just got it going,
you would just be wobbling here.

585
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,370
This looks perfectly stable, but
as soon as you count the energy loss,

586
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,910
you know this ellipse has
to get smaller and smaller.

587
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,970
And at some point,
you're going to go through the separatrix.

588
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,850
At that point, who knows what happens,
and you might end up upside down,

589
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,590
right side up.

590
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,490
It's impossible to predict,
it's a chaotic thing, right?

591
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,086
And, then, at the end, with energy loss,
where will we converge to?

592
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:31,046
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Yeah, this ellipse will go smaller and

593
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,190
smaller and smaller.

594
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,610
And the smallest one would
be the motions here.

595
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,292
So, in the end, everything in nature with
rigid body converges to a flat spin.

596
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:42,449
So for those of you doing
space situational awareness,

597
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:44,666
tracking debris objects and so forth,

598
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:49,530
this is where things would converge
assuming null external torques, right?

599
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,420
So once you include SRP, and
as a recent graduate we did this a lot.

600
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,430
We're looking at the statics
with Joe's work,

601
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,980
things can go quite
different all of a sudden.

602
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,943
because now you need an external influence
to pump up momentum and energy level, and

603
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:04,140
it takes you out again.

604
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,520
And things get way more complicated,
much, much harder to track.

605
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,010
But if it is torque free,
these are the classic results.

606
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,310
Good, and here's an example,
there's no energy dissipation here.

607
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,120
So this one, yes,
it has a slight difference.

608
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,950
You can see it a little
bit more pronounced,

609
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,670
but overall,
nothing like the intermediate axis one.

610
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,880
That one really went hog wild and
went all over the place.

611
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,883
So those are the three,
you can look at all infinite [INAUDIBLE],

612
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,122
that's what I'm looking at here.

613
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:34,665
So minimum energy would be here,
maximum energy would be here.

614
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:38,880
Separatrix energies is here, and
you can see the arrows how they go.

615
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,230
So if you look at your H1, omega 1, 2,

616
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,740
3 coordinates spaces,
you can actually quickly tell.

617
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,420
Actually, we're wobbling about
an axis of maximum inertia.

618
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,210
Because I'm wobbling around
in a positive sense.

619
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,320
If I have my omegas or
Hs move around this axis, and

620
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,630
you can see that's actually
orbiting in a negative.

621
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,430
So this is a positive sense,
this is a negative sense.

622
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:02,350
I know I am spinning about an axis
of least inertia, or near to it.

623
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,551
And if it's flipping back and
forth your closer to the separatrix,

624
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,563
it's doing some crazy stuff.

625
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
But you can look at all
these interceptions, and

626
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,790
this kind of gives you a quick geometric
way to interpret stability rigid bodies.

627
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,930
When we do the dual spinner,

628
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,598
we'll do a complete mathematical
way to talk about stabilities.

629
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,611
And we'll rediscover the same results,

630
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:21,671
just with a more of a linearization
approach on how that works.
