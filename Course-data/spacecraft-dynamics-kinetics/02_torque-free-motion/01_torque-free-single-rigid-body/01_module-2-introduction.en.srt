Hi and welcome to the second
segment of Spacecraft Kinetics.

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,690
Here, we're going to be looking at
torque free motion on rigid bodies.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,860
We start out with a single rigid body and

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,780
study how this actually
will evolve over time.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,250
How does the spin change?

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,310
And this is all coupled
to the gyroscopics.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,180
We will study this with
several different methods.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,280
One of them is called Portal.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,450
It's a very cool graphical way actually
to study large scale motions and

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,160
why are certain spins stable and unstable.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,240
We're also then going to be looking at
different specialized analytic answers

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,570
where we can consider things like
axisymmetric bodies that have special

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,140
answers or bodies that have.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,540
Distinct inertias like this box here,
we go to skinny, intermediate, and

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,885
maximum edge.

16
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:52,840
You'll answer questions like why is this
spin more or less stable, while if you do

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,630
the other spin about the intermediate
axis, you'll find it flips very quickly.

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,510
So we're going to show those results.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,880
In the end,
we're going to look at the dual spinner,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,410
which another passive way
to stabilize an object.

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,910
So while certain spin orientations for
the single body are unstable,

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,420
with a double body system, we can
actually stabilize any of those axes.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,938
And we go through the mathematics
of developing equations of motion,

24
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:17,167
looking at equilibria, and
then discussing stability again.
