now, here, i ran a simulation 
to kind show you things evolve, 
we use omegas phasespace plots 
so i got omega versus omega dot 
so state versus a rate, state versus rate, 
state versus rate, phasespace plot 
im starting a minimum energy case actually, 
is here so, h overi, 
if becomes intermediate 
one, this value goes to one, 
this is kind a nice normalized way to look 
here is less, so this value goes bigger, so here 
this pole hold plot spinning right here purely b, 
in phasespace plots so you see i a b 
velocity, stays there 
if werent in equilibrium that point 
would moving that plot 
two perfectly zero 
so thats a pure spin b 
thats a minimum energy case 
im holding momentum constant 
im pumping energy 
so happens this one shift slightly 
basically means you look 
this coordinate here fixed 
if im looking this curve inside, 
that curve will recessed inward 
that equilibrium point, 
theres a slight wobble to 
a potato shaped like curve 
thats you see a little bit 
a wobble in that coordinate, two axes, 
omega spins this axis 
coordinates kind sweep back forth 
thats youre seeing here 
omega coordinates also go 

right so goes series 
this is answers would look like 
so you predict motions given 
second order differential equations we derived 
you get 
numerically solving eulers original equations 
thats we take an energy 
slightly bumped 
if we bump 
im actually close to separatrix condition 
quite there im pretty close 
so like one curves 
i get there hang 
here along i come back 
if you plotted this in a phase space you get 
this teardrop looking thing 
thats 
this is you hang a 
long time you go back around, 
close to separatrix condition 
omega part 
that one kind oscillates back forth 
doesnt look crazy 
omega speed versus velocity starts to pinch, 
thats you see happening here, 
cause that to slowdown 
a student saying earlier we get close 
to corner points separatrix stuff, 
thats things really slow a sudden 
so that position versus rate stuff 
intuitive here if 
you solved it, thats you would 
so good, thats almost separatrix 
if you make a separatrix you get this 
way i get a closed curve 
is i to really cheat look 
conditions sides integrate 
we know starting here, 
this is basically one separatrix lines 
we know would take an infinity time to reach here 
thats asymptote that we would reach 
i get part starting curve 
that kind completes picture 
right 
so looks like a bow tie you never go 
one end bow tie to end bow tie 
propeller whatever you want to call this shape 
this is this limiting case 
predicted early phasespace plot, 
thats you separatrix 
good 
if we add energy getting to 
curves here starts to look like 
this ones a little pinched dogbone shape still got an eyelid 
this one i lose one 
im either left right hand side 
one depends also initial conditions 
this is you go this infinite sensitivity stuff 
hard to predict youre tumbles 
you going to spin positive negative 
thats chaotic part this system 
here numerics took to one side 
thats im left with, i pump energy 
starts to tighten 
we get to inner curves 
end i pumped energy much i 
i intercept here so you see phase space plots omega ones 
twos zero steady points 
im back in an equilibrium 
thats a pure spin axes least inertia 
so i hope we get 
this is an illustration 
we use phasespace plots to actually 
analyze whole ranges motion 
pole holds one 
this is another approach that you see quite conveniently 
we also validate you 
predict motions 
that make second order differential equations 
you solve coupled nonlinear equations that we earlier 
give you answer 
this is often a nice way to validate 
that this math we did, momentum energy constraints, we correctly 
otherwise things wouldnt agree 
questions this 
this is general inertia case 
so we dont quite get nice sines cosines 
analytic answer, we get three decoupled duffing equations 
is kind elegant, a subresult
