1
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,310
Now, let's talk about attitude.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,560
With the axis symmetry I got
some really easy looking omegas.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,205
One of the most flatline is
gets you the sine and cosines.

4
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:17,749
[SOUND].
That's how we get the amplitude and

5
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:18,360
the right phase.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,169
But that's pretty straight forward, right?

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,740
So, but the resulting motion, just looking
at these yaw, pitch, rolls relative to

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,350
inertial frame, they were all over
the place, and very nasty to predict.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,900
Lots of wiggles, bumps, and
stuff that was going on.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,470
So, it wasn't very intuitive to
predict what happens to the natural

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,090
procession of a torque-free
attitude motion.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,740
So this is a classic result
that people have done.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,110
And anybody heard of
mutation procession before?

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:50,930
Good?

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,910
Was it Russell?

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,810
What does mutation mean?

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,305
>> It's where you're like
slowly going around and

18
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,304
circling around what you're [CROSSTALK]
>> So is this mutating or

19
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:02,505
is this processing?

20
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:07,630
Is it mutating now or processing?

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,610
Who thinks mutation procession
definitions are confusing?

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,460
>> Like slowly around the depth.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,850
>> Good.
I hate them, quite frankly.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm always confused by those darn things.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,850
Why?

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,950
In the end,
those mutation procession things,

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,560
as I'll show you, they're nothing but
older angle rates.

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,730
And, as often in the literature,
we're not consistent.

29
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,640
Some people talk about 3-1-3
Euler angle rates which means

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,790
certain motions mean something.

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,920
That's the notation part.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,280
That's the procession part.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,871
It's a 3-1-3 versus a 3-2-1.

34
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:44,110
The processions are often very similar
because they are both 3 first axis.

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,390
But the 3-2-1s and the 3-1-3s are the two
common things you will see people

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,680
use to describe torque free attitude
motions and look at the tumbles.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,330
But they don't always tell you what they
are doing until you look at the math,

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,230
it takes a long time so
I'd rather they just tell me,

39
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,920
look I'm studying it using three
one three over under rates.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,490
I know right away what you are talking
about verses mutation and damping.

41
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,300
But it is a common mutation, common
thing you hear so let's cover it and

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,090
I want to show you
a little bit what it does.

43
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,160
The other issue is so
we are going to use older angle rates.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,500
to start to prescribe how much does
this wobbling disk process around and

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,250
what's happening there.

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,730
The other trick is, whereas my
earlier example acts as a metric,

47
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,120
I was plotting my yaw pitch roll
angles relative to the inertial frame.

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,510
With nutation precession,

49
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,700
those terms, we're never talking about
attitude motion relative to inertial.

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,260
We're talking about attitude motion
relative to your momentum vector.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,000
That's the key difference.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
So, if this thing is spinning this way,

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,830
you have a big momentum
vector sticking up.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,530
Great!

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,540
Then you talk about precessing
about that momentum vector and

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,690
how much you're nutating and
wobbling Around the momentum.

57
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,320
If you're spinning this way,

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,560
then procession is really defined
around that momentum vector, right?

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
So it has nothing to do with
where your inertial system is,

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,970
it's torque-free motion.

61
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,150
Momentum vector is preserved.

62
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,030
So, if we do that, let's go through this.

63
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,460
I know some of you have seen this.

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,290
So, you have some momentum vector,
it's torque-free motion,

65
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,660
as seen by inertial observer,
this is a fixed quantity.

66
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,930
You give something some spin It's
going to have some fixed momentum.

67
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,270
And whatever else happens and

68
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,810
how it gyrates and wobbles,
that momentum has to be fixed.

69
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,050
So, we can now pick an inertial
frame that is lined up with n3.

70
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,446
Just historically they pick the third
one for some reason, to be = -H.

71
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,170
So now, I can talk about attitude
motion relative to this frame here.

72
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,880
And n one two are really arbitrary,

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,180
they don't really matter much
in the end you will find.

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,110
So I can write the momentum vector
as minus h times n three and

75
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,220
this is also an frame, right?

76
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,900
It's just lined, however you released it,
that momentum was this direction.

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,530
So n three goes in the opposite,
that's it.

78
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,200
So now we can write that and
we can say okay, good this makes my

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,290
h vector in this particular end frame,
all right this is a special end frame,

80
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,160
not a general end frame,
is zero zero something times a dcm.

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,900
This allows me to write my momentum

82
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,350
vector components in the body
frame in an easier way.

83
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,610
Generally this H if you have an arbitrary
inertial frame H would have an H1 two and

84
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,670
three in frame component.

85
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,370
Here we only have a third component, so

86
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,380
that means times the DCM you are not only
pulling out the parts of the third column.

87
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,780
That saves you lots of Algebra.

88
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,610
Why do we do that?

89
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,020
So here's the DCM and
using 3-2-1 Euler angles here so

90
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,650
I'll get 3-2-1 Euler angle rates out of
this stuff times that zero zero minus H.

91
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:48,050
You do this, you have the H times sine and
the minus minus cancel.

92
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,670
Here we have H with a minus and
a sine and a cosine of the third angle,

93
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,730
which is rolled and
the second angle which is pitch.

94
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,940
So phi is rolled, theta is pitch, and
the same thing for the third term.

95
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,820
And this is the momentum
vector in the body frame.

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,420
But then, you remember from kinetics,
H is also equal to i omega, right?

97
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,960
That's what we derived for
rotational motion.

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,590
And in principle coordinate frame.

99
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,590
This is simply i one, omega one, i two,
omega two, i three, omega three.

100
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,290
So this is an elegant way that we can use
the three dimensional and get momentum

101
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,440
vector to provide three constraints on how
does omega and the angles have to roll it.

102
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,170
And you can see out of the 3-2-1 Euler
angles pulling out this column here

103
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,570
because it was all about the third one,
theta one doesn't appear here.

104
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,190
There's no yaw angle in here.

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,365
Which kind of makes sense because there
will be the motion about the momentum

106
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,220
,vector that happens there.

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,400
So, if this is the spinning and

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,060
the processing rate you're going to have,
if we take the system and twist it for

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,540
80 degrees about the momentum vector,
it's completely asymmetric.

110
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,010
It gives you the same
kind of a wobbly motion.

111
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,920
So that's kind of what manifests
in the Mathew, does know we are.

112
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
There is H and these omegas.

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,580
Well, this is nice, so I don't have to
integrate differential kinematic equations

114
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,850
to come up with, at this attitude,
what is omega going to be?

115
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,930
It's kind of like the energy conservation,
the bouncing ball problem, right?

116
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,710
That we've used the complete
three dimensional h vector

117
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,040
here instead of just the magnitude
as we did with pole plots.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,970
So that's good.

119
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,290
So now, we can divide by inertia and
you get this expression.

120
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,890
So, I can write analytically,
if this is the pitch and this is the roll,

121
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,300
these are the omegas you must have or
otherwise you're violating momentum.

122
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,650
So good, we have that.

123
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,880
Now the next step is we have our
differential kinematic equations for

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,710
my Euler angle rates and omega.

125
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:42,090
Now I just had an expression of omegas in
terms of these angles and you plug that

126
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,870
in so instead of having a differential
kinematic for theta, you know,

127
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,760
your state rates then you differentiate
omega to get the accelerations,

128
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,890
here we used angular momentum to
completely get rid of omega dots and

129
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,560
I get, I end up with torque free motion
that's three coupled non linear.

130
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,920
But first order of differential equations.

131
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,210
So I got, I used angular momentum
to get rid of some of those dots.

132
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,530
Didn't have double dots in the end, in
attitude angles, I only have single dots.

133
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,090
And this would be your procession,

134
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,370
this would be your mutation
if you used a 3-2-1.

135
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,770
And then, the third roll, we often just
call roll as the final roll motion.

136
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,040
But that's the wobbly plate problem, we've
all seen this plate on a table, right,

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,320
that wobbles It doesn't keep the same
plane, that plate kind of goes around and

138
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,540
precession and
does some weird stuff, right?

139
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,720
That's all going to be
predicted now by these motions.

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,600
If you look at this, positive, positive,
H magnitude is positive, sin squared,

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,470
cosine squared, all positive.

142
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,760
The precession rate, your yaw rate
essentially, is always negative.

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,010
And this comes out of the definition
that we've chosen and end frame which is

144
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,870
in the minus H direction otherwise
there will be a sign flip.

145
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,460
So is different this could be different
but this is more the classic one

146
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,870
whereas the pitching,
that's basically a mutation rate.

147
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,060
Does this, if this spinning,
is there an up and

148
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,150
down motion that happens because of this?

149
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,720
And you can see, for example,
if i3 is equal to i2.

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,870
This term actually vanishes and
you get rid of notation rates, as well.

151
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,860
So different shapes call
certain rate things to change.

152
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,340
Anyway, so this is the classic one for
general inertias, and

153
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,930
we cannot be positive.

154
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,230
If you have an axis symmetric case, so

155
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,380
I'm just assuming here B1
is my axis of symmetry.

156
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,010
So, I1 is unique and I2 and I3 are equal.

157
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,610
And you plug it into those equations.

158
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,630
They simply fly down to
a constant mutation rate and

159
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,300
a constant procession
rate that you would have.

160
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,930
This would tell you that
if the sphere is spinning,

161
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,750
that at about the momentum vector,
this object is spinning, but

162
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,060
it's also slowly processing around.

163
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,330
It has to do that to
conserve angular momentum.

164
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,490
And so, these are some classic results
where you can now actually make

165
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,420
predictions about the attitude motions,

166
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,640
and turns out all their angles are kind of
convenient for some of this stuff.

167
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,780
They're nicely to be worked out.

168
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,170
And this tells you what happens to
the motion, since data is constant,

169
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,680
your roll rate that you would have in
this situation also will stay constant.

170
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,380
So this is pretty classical.

171
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,180
We build a lot of spaceships that
are kind of, at least originally,

172
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,630
almost cylindrical, very axi-symmetric
just because they come out of rockets and

173
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,900
it's been released and have a wobble.

174
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,950
These equations are very common to kind of
analyze what happens post tip off,

175
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,110
how are things going to process,
what's going to go on.

176
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,400
So, it's a convenient form.

177
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,730
Now, there's some other stuff people.

178
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,870
I'm just going to highlight this.

179
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,030
We're not going to go through details.

180
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,470
There's no particular homeworks on this.

181
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,570
But if you have angular momentum vector,
here, this is my axis of symmetry, for

182
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,890
example, that I had.

183
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm spinning about this axis,
and I'm slowly precessing around.

184
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,250
That's the momentum that I have.

185
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,920
So the current angular velocity vector
is not equal to just this spin,

186
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,580
because you're spinning about b1 and
some of the other axis.

187
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,210
And there's all these different angles,
but

188
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,590
you're basically revolving around this
while processing around the he vector.

189
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,490
So these two motions that I'm
doing is basically describe cones.

190
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,240
And there's different ways people
have written these equations, but

191
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,060
you can show mathematically
because this is equivalent to,

192
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,870
those are the right equations
this is a special case.

193
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,100
What they call a space cone and
a body cone, so

194
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,158
this is your momentum factor
that's fixed and our whole space.

195
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:23,530
The Omega Vector will
tend to evolve around it

196
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,600
depending on axis symmetry or not.

197
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,630
And then there's the body
axis that you have.

198
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,180
That one is going to
possess around as well.

199
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,370
And so, it's like,

200
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,160
you can mathematically describe it
as one cone rotating on another.

201
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,070
And this is a What I want
is the largest inertia.

202
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,660
So that means it's kind of like a frisbee,
a flat plate, spinning but

203
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,670
slightly wobbling.

204
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,360
That's kind of an oblate condition.

205
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,620
If you have a prolate condition,
which is more this pen, like a and

206
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,770
or rocket body, and
is spinning about the axis of symmetry and

207
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,600
wobbling, you end up also with
a body cone and a space cone.

208
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,870
But you can see you're kind of
wobbling on the outside of the,

209
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,010
the thing's on the outside.

210
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,610
Whereas here, it's kind of
wobbling around it as a whole.

211
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,230
So, if you study some classic papers on
torque-free motions, you might come across

212
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,220
some of these space cones, body cones and
what I hope you remember is wait a minute,

213
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,380
I remember this has to do
with these intersections.

214
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,000
And read up of on other angle rates and
how we can rewrite them as conic motions

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,150
essentially cones and
cones rolling this was all good and

216
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,850
popular way back before we had all
these wonderful computer tools.

217
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,375
These days use integrate and
[SOUND] out comes the answers.

218
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,571
But people done an amazing amount of
work in attitude as well to get analytic

219
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:38,581
answers and this is kind of one of
the stages where this stuff comes from.
