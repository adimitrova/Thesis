1
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:11,196
There's an integral, every one of those
equations we can actually integrate and

2
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:14,660
come up with these conserved quantities.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,230
You can think I'm calling him K here,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,949
this is not kinetic energy,
it's something different.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,199
But it's like energy, so
it's an integral of motion basically.

6
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,410
So it leaves us a waypoint
to go to a set of slides.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,192
So let's say we have our
classic mx double dot

8
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:44,170
= -kx.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,000
Anybody know what the integral
of motion of this one is?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,057
What's the preserved quantity
of this differential equation?

11
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:52,694
Spring mass system.

12
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:55,750
What's constant?

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,789
You did it in the homework with
two particles in the spring mass.

14
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,750
Part B, what did you have to
use to get that relationship?

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,840
Energy, right.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,580
Basically.

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,410
We know out of this, this is nothing but
a spring mass system.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,470
So we know that that kinetic energy and

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,910
the spring potential energy summed
up will give us a constant, right.

20
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,790
But we know that.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,180
Can we mathematically prove it?

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,760
So I'm going to show you quickly
how to integrate these system.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,237
And this is a simple linear system.

24
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:25,020
With this other term there, the cubic
stiffness has an x cubed instead of an x.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,110
But even x cubed is trivial to integrate.

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,610
I expect you guys to know
how to integrate x cubed.

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,420
In the next homework you will
have other terms in there.

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,580
There was one homework where
you end up with a sine theta,

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,430
but even sine theta isn't that evil.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,320
I know you guys know how to
integrate sine theta, hopefully.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,204
So you can come up with these
integrals of motions, all right.

32
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,450
So let's see how we can do this.

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,090
And there's some little tricks.

34
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,769
You'd have to write them down to
remember all the little steps.

35
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:55,930
So I've got the second ordered
derivative of x equals to minus kx.

36
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,720
This works nicely.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,330
Now I'm going to do a substitution where
I'm saying v is simply x dot, right?

38
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,770
It's commonly done,
like you do in second order system,

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,880
we put in first order forms and
integrate it.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,488
That's typically what we do.

41
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:14,421
So this side can be
rewritten as dv/dt = -kx.

42
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,688
And you can can also say, well,

43
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:23,120
let me multiply this dt
Over to the other side.

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,040
So mass times differential velocities
equal to -kx times differential time.

45
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,170
This phone,
this side is easy to integrate.

46
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,811
That's just mdv.

47
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:38,470
The integral of that is just going to
a give you v plus the constant.

48
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,410
But the right hand side, x depends on
time and we don't have an answer for

49
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,800
it in this form yet.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,850
Is not as easy, so once you get to
the stage breaking these dts and dvs up,

51
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,170
the trick is you want to
multiply both sides times v

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,900
which is of course dx/dt,
right that's what .x means.

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,770
So if I multiply both
sides over with this.

54
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:09,120
Here on the left hand side,
I'm going to have mvdv, that's easy.

55
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,768
So, right hand side -kx times v and

56
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:17,599
v is dx/dt.dt.

57
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,851
These dt's cancel and

58
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,773
you end up with nothing but

59
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:31,041
-kxdx, that's it.

60
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:37,490
Now we've got a set of equations we
can easily integrate and I'm not doing

61
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,240
in between two specific points in time I'm
just going to get the indefinite integral.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,984
So, if you do the indefinite
integral of this,

63
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:48,400
the integral v with respect to v is
just going to be v squared over 2 right.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,934
So you end up with mass velocity
squared over two which is nothing but

65
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:52,870
kinetic energy.

66
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,408
The right hand side,

67
00:03:54,408 --> 00:04:00,310
the integral of x with respect to x is
just going to be -kx squared over 2.

68
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,000
And then out of this whole thing
you have to do plus a constant.

69
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,060
What's this constant physically
going to be in this problem?

70
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:16,405
If you look at it the constant mv
squared over 2 plus kx squared over 2,

71
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:17,940
what is that?

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,180
Total energy exactly that's it.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,887
That's because it has a physical thing but
in a more abstract sense when you have

74
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:26,322
differential equations we
can often do this step but

75
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:29,643
you don't get something that's
actually in terms of energy it's just

76
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,663
an equation constant of whatever
these other things are right?

77
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:37,543
So here happens to be total energy but
if you go back to these differential

78
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,945
equations and do the same steps
bring this to the right hand side.

79
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:47,012
Instead of just having a minus A omega
I also Also have minus B omega cubed,

80
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:52,321
I did the integrals of those in the end
then I'll have an x to the 4th over 4 and

81
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:55,753
an x squared over 2 with
the right constants, and

82
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,245
an integration constant, right?

83
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:02,045
And that's what we found here,
so if you do that step,

84
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:05,005
and I encourage you to practice that
once because in the homework you have to

85
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:10,100
use it anyway for one of the solve
the homework for, you can get this.

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,865
So this is the integration constant,
you can see this is not mass over velocity

87
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,832
squared the units are wrong this
is actually velocity rates,

88
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,684
this is an acceleration squared,
this can't be energy but

89
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:23,248
it's something energy like in that
term and this is a preserve quantity.

90
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:27,640
If I get my resulting tumbling motion
out of your integration, and every

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,536
integration times that if you're computing
on mega .2 integrated and you have

92
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:37,506
your current omega and you go through this
math, you should always get the same k.

93
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:38,020
All right?

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,310
So this becomes the great integration
check for talk free motion as well.

95
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,650
And I think one of the homeworks, in the
next homeworks said has you numerically

96
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,950
stimulate this and validate that this
actually, you stimulate this numerically,

97
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,020
you compute this analytically
with the T's and the H's.

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,540
And this math should always
give you back that same value

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,870
that everything make sense.

100
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,244
That's a good numerical
check of what's going on.

101
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:05,460
So this k1, 2's and 3's are now
written out in terms of the energies,

102
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,820
these your integration constants for
the system.

103
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,425
So I'm giving you the complete
answer here at this stage.
