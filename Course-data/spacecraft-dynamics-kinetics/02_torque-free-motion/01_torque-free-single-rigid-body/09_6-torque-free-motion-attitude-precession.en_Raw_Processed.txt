now, lets talk attitude 
axis symmetry i got 
really easy looking omegas 
one flatline is 
gets you sine cosines 
sound 
thats we get amplitude 
right phase 
thats pretty straight forward, right 
so, resulting motion, looking 
yaw, pitch, rolls relative to 
inertial frame, 
place, nasty to predict 
lots wiggles, bumps, 
stuff that going 
so, wasnt intuitive to 
predict happens to natural 
procession a torquefree 
attitude motion 
so this is a classic result 
that people done 
anybody heard 
mutation procession 
good 
russell 
mutation mean 
youre like 
slowly going around 
circling around youre crosstalk 
so is this mutating 
is this processing 
is mutating processing 
thinks mutation procession 
definitions confusing 
like slowly around depth 
good 
i hate them, quite frankly 
im always confused darn things 

in end, 
mutation procession things, 
ill show you, theyre nothing 
older angle rates 
and, often in literature, 
consistent 
people talk 
euler angle rates means 
certain motions mean something 
thats notation part 
thats procession part 
a versus a 
processions often similar 
first axis 
two 
common things you will see people 
use to describe torque free attitude 
motions look tumbles 
dont always tell you 
until you look math, 
takes a long time so 
id rather tell me, 
look im studying using three 
one three rates 
i know right away you talking 
verses mutation damping 
is a common mutation, common 
thing you hear so lets cover 
i want to show you 
a little bit 
issue is so 
we going to use older angle rates 
to start to prescribe much 
this wobbling disk process around 
whats happening there 
trick is, whereas 
earlier example acts a metric, 
i plotting yaw pitch roll 
angles relative to inertial frame 
nutation precession, 
terms, never talking 
attitude motion relative to inertial 
talking attitude motion 
relative to momentum vector 
thats key difference 
so, if this thing is spinning this way, 
you a big momentum 
vector sticking 
great 
you talk precessing 
that momentum vector 
much youre nutating 
wobbling around momentum 
if youre spinning this way, 
procession is really defined 
around that momentum vector, right 
so nothing to 
inertial system is, 
torquefree motion 
momentum vector is preserved 
so, if we that, lets go this 
i know you seen this 
so, you momentum vector, 
torquefree motion, 
seen inertial observer, 
this is a fixed quantity 
you give something spin 
going to fixed momentum 
whatever else happens 
gyrates wobbles, 
that momentum to fixed 
so, we pick an inertial 
frame that is lined n 
historically pick third 
one reason, to h 
so now, i talk attitude 
motion relative to this frame here 
n one two really arbitrary, 
dont really matter much 
in end you will find 
so i write momentum vector 
minus h times n three 
this is also an frame, right 
lined, however you released it, 
that momentum this direction 
so n three goes in opposite, 
thats 
so we write that 
we say okay, good this makes 
h vector in this particular end frame, 
right this is a special end frame, 
a general end frame, 
is zero zero something times a dcm 
this allows to write momentum 
vector components in body 
frame in an easier way 
generally this h if you an arbitrary 
inertial frame h would an h two 
three in frame component 
here we a third component, so 
that means times dcm you 
pulling parts third column 
that saves you lots algebra 
we that 
so heres dcm 
using euler angles here so 
ill get euler angle rates 
this stuff times that zero zero minus h 
you this, you h times sine 
minus minus cancel 
here we h a minus 
a sine a cosine third angle, 
is rolled 
second angle is pitch 
so phi is rolled, theta is pitch, 
thing third term 
this is momentum 
vector in body frame 
then, you remember kinetics, 
h is also equal to i omega, right 
thats we derived 
rotational motion 
in principle coordinate frame 
this is simply i one, omega one, i two, 
omega two, i three, omega three 
so this is an elegant way that we use 
three dimensional get momentum 
vector to provide three constraints 
omega angles to roll 
you see euler 
angles pulling this column here 
third one, 
theta one doesnt appear here 
theres yaw angle in here 
kind makes sense there 
will motion momentum 
,vector that happens there 
so, if this is spinning 
processing rate youre going to have, 
if we take system twist 
degrees momentum vector, 
completely asymmetric 
gives you 
kind a wobbly motion 
so thats kind manifests 
in mathew, know we 
there is h omegas 
well, this is nice, so i dont to 
integrate differential kinematic equations 
to come with, this attitude, 
is omega going to 
kind like energy conservation, 
bouncing ball problem, right 
that weve used complete 
three dimensional h vector 
here instead magnitude 
we pole plots 
so thats good 
so now, we divide inertia 
you get this expression 
so, i write analytically, 
if this is pitch this is roll, 
omegas you must 
otherwise youre violating momentum 
so good, we that 
next step is we 
differential kinematic equations 
euler angle rates omega 
i an expression omegas in 
terms angles you plug that 
in so instead a differential 
kinematic theta, you know, 
state rates you differentiate 
omega to get accelerations, 
here we used angular momentum to 
completely get rid omega dots 
i get, i end torque free motion 
thats three coupled non linear 
first order differential equations 
so i got, i used angular momentum 
to get rid dots 
didnt double dots in end, in 
attitude angles, i single dots 
this would procession, 
this would mutation 
if you used a 
then, third roll, we often 
call roll final roll motion 
thats wobbly plate problem, weve 
seen this plate a table, right, 
that wobbles doesnt keep 
plane, that plate kind goes around 
precession 
weird stuff, right 
thats going to 
predicted motions 
if you look this, positive, positive, 
h magnitude is positive, sin squared, 
cosine squared, positive 
precession rate, yaw rate 
essentially, is always negative 
this comes definition 
that weve chosen end frame is 
in minus h direction otherwise 
there will a sign flip 
so is different this could different 
this is classic one 
whereas pitching, 
thats basically a mutation rate 
this, if this spinning, 
is there an 
motion that happens this 
you see, example, 
if i is equal to i 
this term actually vanishes 
you get rid notation rates, well 
so different shapes call 
certain rate things to change 
anyway, so this is classic one 
general inertias, 
we cannot positive 
if you an axis symmetric case, so 
im assuming here b 
is axis symmetry 
so, i is unique i i equal 
you plug equations 
simply fly to 
a constant mutation rate 
a constant procession 
rate that you would 
this would tell you that 
if sphere is spinning, 
that momentum vector, 
this object is spinning, 
also slowly processing around 
to that to 
conserve angular momentum 
so, classic results 
you actually make 
predictions attitude motions, 
turns angles kind 
convenient this stuff 
theyre nicely to worked 
this tells you happens to 
motion, since data is constant, 
roll rate that you would in 
this situation also will stay constant 
so this is pretty classical 
we build a lot spaceships that 
kind of, least originally, 
almost cylindrical, axisymmetric 
come rockets 
released a wobble 
equations common to kind 
analyze happens post tip off, 
things going to process, 
whats going to go 
so, a convenient form 
now, theres stuff people 
im going to highlight this 
going to go details 
theres particular homeworks this 
if you angular momentum vector, 
here, this is axis symmetry, 
example, that i 
im spinning this axis, 
im slowly precessing around 
thats momentum that i 
so current angular velocity vector 
is equal to this spin, 
youre spinning b 
axis 
theres different angles, 

youre basically revolving around this 
while processing around vector 
so two motions that im 
is basically describe cones 
theres different ways people 
written equations, 
you show mathematically 
this is equivalent to, 
right equations 
this is a special case 
call a space cone 
a body cone, so 
this is momentum factor 
thats fixed whole space 
omega vector will 
tend to evolve around 
depending axis symmetry 
theres body 
axis that you 
that one is going to 
possess around well 
so, like, 
you mathematically describe 
one cone rotating another 
this is a i want 
is largest inertia 
so that means kind like a frisbee, 
a flat plate, spinning 
slightly wobbling 
thats kind an oblate condition 
if you a prolate condition, 
is this pen, like a 
rocket body, 
is spinning axis symmetry 
wobbling, you end also 
a body cone a space cone 
you see youre kind 
wobbling outside the, 
things outside 
whereas here, kind 
wobbling around a whole 
so, if you study classic papers 
torquefree motions, you might come across 
space cones, body cones 
i hope you remember is wait a minute, 
i remember this to 
intersections 
read angle rates 
we rewrite conic motions 
essentially cones 
cones rolling this good 
popular way back we 
wonderful computer tools 
days use integrate 
sound comes answers 
people done an amazing amount 
work in attitude well to get analytic 
answers this is kind one 
stages this stuff comes
