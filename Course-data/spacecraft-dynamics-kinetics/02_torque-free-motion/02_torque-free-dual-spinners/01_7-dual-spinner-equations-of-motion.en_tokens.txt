we
have
wrapped
up
for
pre-motion
,
right
?
so
that
's
a
spacecraft
tumbling
.
there
's
different
ways
to
write
it
.
we
can
predict
the
angular
velocities
if
it
's
axisymmetric
analytically
in
a
closed
form
.
if
it
's
not
axisymmetric
general
,
there
were
these
homogeneous
undamped
duffing
equations
that
we
can
write
,
which
is
kind
of
elegant
,
that
in
your
current
homework
you
will
actually
apply
this
different
ways
.
what
we
're
moving
to
next
is
different
ways
to
start
,
not
just
having
a
rigidbody
by
itself
spinning
and
trying
to
be
stable
,
'cause
that
does
n't
always
work
out
.
a
common
design
that
moved
us
from
torque-free
motion
,
where
people
looked
at
natural
equilibrias
of
a
-one
single
solid
spacecraft
,
that
's
the
simplest
thing
you
can
build
,
there
's
no
moving
parts
.
but
it
has
limitations
about
which
axis
you
have
to
pretty
much
spin
about
axis
of
max
inertia
if
you
wan
na
turn
stable
with
energy
loss
.
now
we
're
going
to
look
at
different
systems
.
the
dual-spinner
is
a
pop
--
-
used
to
be
a
very
popular
design
for
geo
satellites
.
it
's
still
being
built
for
some
of
them
.
i
think
cassini
is
actually
a
dual
spinner
.
it
has
this
huge
platform
that
spun
at
a
different
range
than
the
lower
platform
and
it
helps
the
stability
as
well
.
and
so
that
's
a
very
classic
result
that
still
applies
.
then
we
're
gon
na
look
at
also
gravity
gradients
.
that
's
the
way
people
build
satellites
with
it
--
-exploit
differential
gravity
to
stabilize
the
spacecraft
.
so
,
but
those
are
all
passive
weight
.
we
do
n't
have
any
active
feedback
sensing
.
where
am
i
pointing
,
where
should
i
be
going
,
and
how
do
i
close
this
loop
.
that
will
be
then
in
the
third
part
of
the
class
where
we
talk
about
nonlinear
control
for
the
feedback
control
developments
.
we
're
kind
of
putting
--
-
we
're
gon
na
have
a
little
bit
of
theory
on
control
theory
.
you
get
all
the
basics
basic
that
we
just
need
for
this
class
.
i
'm
not
giving
a
whole
class
on
nonlinear
control
,
but
this
is
the
specifics
you
need
,
and
this-and
this
is
how
we
apply
it
specifically
for
the
attitude
control
problem
.
all
right
?
so
,
now
dual
spin
and
gravity
gradient
,
those
are
passive
ways
to
stabilize
a
spacecraft
.
so
let
's
look
at
this
.
what
we
can
write
is
--
-
i
'm
just
modeling
my
spacecraft
like
this
.
this
does
n't
necessarily
have
to
be
an
axisymmetric
body
.
i
just
drew
a
cylinder
cause
it
was
easy
to
draw
.
what
i
do
have
is
a
coordinate
frame
b
,
that
's
a
principle
coordinate
frame
,
which
we
now
know
means
,
i
've
chosen
an
option
where
my
inertia
tensor
just
becomes
a
diagonal
.
all
right
?
so
,
you
have
that
and
i
'm
lining
up
my
spin
wheel
with
where
its
spin
axis
is
lined
up
with
one
of
my
principal
axis
,
and
just
without
loss
in
generality
,
i
just
called
it
the
first
one
.
all
right
.
so
,
that
's
how
this
thing
is
lined
up
.
so
,
this
flywheel
can
have
a
speed
,
big
omega
,
that
's
the
speed
it
has
relative
to
the
body
.
if
you
zero
big
omega
,
that
means
this
body
now
acts
as
a
single
rigidbody
.
you
know
,
the
brakes
failed
and
they
clamped
up
and
if
the
spacecraft
tumbles
the
wheel
tumbles
,
right
?
but
if
you
have
a
non-zero
omega
,
that
means
the
wheel
is
moving
so
it
's
a
way
of
having
now
,
basically
,
two
rigidbodies
.
we
're
not
looking
at
flexing
at
this
point
but
it
's
a
multi-body
system
that
we
're
actually
solving
with
this
.
so
,
let
's
start
looking
at
these
things
.
we
're
going
to
use
,
as
before
,
we
use
h
dot
equal
to
l
for
a
single
rigidbody
.
we
're
going
to
do
h
dot
equal
to
l
for
this
two-body
system
.
and
the
first
thing
we
need
is
to
get
momentum
.
different
ways
to
write
this
.
is
is
my
inertia
tensor
of
the
spacecraft
.
iw
is
the
inertia
tensor
of
this
flywheel
,
and
this
is
a
full
three
by
three
,
all
right
?
but
,
since
i
've
chosen
a
b
frame
where
is
is
a
diagonal
,
and
you
can
see
this
flywheel
is
symmetric
so
it
has
a
unique
inertia
-
i
'm
just
calling
that
inertia
,
iw
-
along
the
spin
axis
.
and
then
there
's
two
transverse
inertias
that
are
equal
.
but
in
the
b
one
,
two
,
and
three
frame
it
's
also
gon
na
be
an
is
diagonal
matrix
.
the
b
frame
is
both
the
principal
frame
for
the
spacecraft
,
and
for
this
wheel
because
of
the
symmetry
assumption
.
so
,
from
that
,
actually
,
you
can
have
a
combined
sector
.
i
is
actually
the
combined
spacecraft
plus
wheel
inertia
tensor
,
and
it
's
also
gon
na
be
diagonal
.
a
diagonal
plus
a
diagonal
gives
you
a
diagonal
.
so
,
i
'm
just
calling
these
i
one
,
two
,
and
three
.
the
wheel
inertia
about
b
one
,
its
spin
axis
,
is
just
going
to
be
iw
the
scalar
of
it
.
for
convenience
.
now
,
that
's
the
inertia
tensor
,
now
we
want
to
write
angular
momentum
.
different
ways
you
can
add
up
the
contributions
.
one
way
is
,
you
could
say
,
'ok
,
the
spacecraft
is
spinning
'
,
and
you
can
see
,
this
is
actually
lined
up
in
the
cg
.
the
cg
of
the
wheel
,
the
cga
of
the
spacecraft
,
they
are
coincidence
here
.
it
does
n't
have
to
be
.
if
it
's
not
coincident
,
that
part
of
the
mass
is
like
having
a
bolt
one
meter
removed
,
you
just
use
parallel
axis
theorem
,
and
adjust
the
inertia
tensor
of
the
spacecraft
.
that
's
what
you
typically
do
.
so
,
without
loss
of
in
generality
we
can
typically
write
it
this
way
.
but
here
,
i
'm
showing
you
one
way
where
i
'm
saying
,
the
total
inertia
times
omega
,
that
's
really
gon
na
be
the
inertia
of
the
spacecraft
times
omega
,
which
makes
sense
that
omega
is
b
relative
to
n.
that
's
the
classic
angular
momentum
you
've
seen
.
then
,
the
wheel
momentum
is
gon
na
be
the
wheel
inertia
times
omega
w
relative
to
...
and-and
i
'm
gon
na
break
that
up
actually
into
mathematics
here
.
so
we
have
i
is
equal
to
is
plus
iw
.
and
if
i
'm
saying
now
,
is
times
omega
bn
,
that
's
the
momentum
of
the
spacecraft
.
sorry
,
is
times
omega
bn
,
and
iw
,
i
need
the
angular
velocity
of
w
relative
to
n.
but
w
relative
to
n
is
simply
gon
na
be
big
omega
times
b
one
plus
omega
b
relative
to
n.
this
is
your
angular
velocity
of
the
wheel
frame
relative
to
the
body
,
alright
?
that
omega
was
defined
relative
to
the
body
frame
.
so
,
like
in
that
exam
problem
where
you
had
feet
,
that
second
angled
part
one
defined
relative
to
the
first
link
,
you
know
,
this
is
how
it
comes
up
conveniently
.
so
,
that
makes
it
easy
.
so
now
we
've
got
this
,
so
this
is
really
gon
na
be
expanded
as
iw
times
omega
bn
plus
iw
times
this
part
,
alright
?
this
and
this
combines
to
is
plus
iw
times
omega
bn
,
plus
this
part
is
really
a
three
by
three
that
you
have
.
and
this
in
the
b
frame
,
'cause
that
's
the
principal
frame
of
the
wheel
,
and
the
angular
velocity
is
just
gon
na
be
omega
zero
,
zero
,
in
the
b
frame
.
if
you
use
b
frame
components
.
so
,
you
can
see
out
of
this
all
you
're
gon
na
get
is
this
inertia
which
is
iw
times
omega
,
and
these
other
ones
do
n't
matter
cause
they
're
all
multiplied
times
zero
.
so
,
out
of
the
end
result
,
this
thing
just
becomes
iw
,
big
omega
,
and
that
's
in
the
1
axis
.
so
,
if
you
carry
this
out
,
you
would
get
this
zero
,
zero
.
and
that
's
the
same
thing
as
b
one
hat
times
that
.
this
is
nothing
but
the
inertia
tensor
times
this
.
so
,
those
things
added
up
.
different
ways
you
can
get
to
it
,
alright
?
so
,
here
i
'm
doing
a
little
bit
more
of
a
direct
way
,
where
i
kind
of
doing
this
implicitly
.
ok
,
this
is
the
angular
momentum
as
if
the
wheel
were
locked
,
and
then
i
'm
adding
the
angular
momentum
of
the
wheel
relative
to
the
body
.
different
ways
you
can
approach
it
.
but
try
different
ways
cause
it
should
always
give
you
the
same
,
and
these
are
simple
derivations
again
.
this
is
prime
stuff
for
a
final
exam
.
you
know
,
i
can-
something
you
can
do
,
you
should
be
able
to
do
.
so
,
now
we
have
h
written
out
,
and
this
tensor
,
i
'm
not
specifying
any
particular
frames
at
this
point
.
anyway
,
it
just
,
it
all
adds
up
.
so
,
we
need
h
dot
equal
to
l.
we
're
gon
na
choose
to
differentiate
this
vector
as
seen
by
the
body
frame
.
why
?
because
we
know
it
's
seen
by
the
body
frame
,
the-the
i
primes
will
be
zero
.
but
then
we
have
to
add
omega
crossed
,
there
is
momentum
vector
again
,
alright
?
same
thing
is
what
we
did
with
a
single
rigidbody
,
we
're
applying
it
to
this
dual-spinner
now
.
this
part
looks
just
like
the
rigidbody
,
which
is
actually
have
the
inertias
of
two
rigidbodies
,
if
one
were
locked
relative
to
the
other
,
and
it
gives
you
the
same
results
.
so
,
you
'd
have
the
body
frame
derivative
of
omega
,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
the
inertial
derivative
of
omega
,
alright
?
cause
omega
bn
,
the
crossed
products
vanish
.
so
,
this
gets
you
exactly
the
same
parts
plus
omega
cross
this
vector
,
that
gets
you
omega
till
the
i
omega
.
so
,
this
part
is
just
like
a
single
rigidbody
,
just
a
t-
if
that
t-
if
that's-
if
that
's
,
if
that
wheel
locks
in
,
it
is
a
single
rigidbody
,
alright
?
essentially
.
that
's
one
way
to
look
at
it
.
this
second
part
.
people
typically
call
this
momentum
of
the
wheel
relative
to
the
body
,
a
little
h
,
little
-
a
lowercase
h.
you
see
this
often
in
the
literature
,
so
i
'm
gon
na
use
the
same
notation
.
so
,
iw
a
-
this
is
a
little
h.
so
,
as
seen
by
the
body
frame
,
this
wheel
can
change
speed
,
it
can
spin
up
,
it
can
spin
down
.
so
,
i
'll
have
an
h
dot
in
the
b
one
,
and
then
omega
crossed
hb1
.
this
vector
,
it
has
to
be
equal
to
the
external
torque
.
so
,
if
you
carry
this
out
,
you
can
plug
in
omega
as
being
omega
one
b
one
,
omega
two
b
two
,
omega
three
b
three
,
and
you
cross
with
b
one
,
you
know
how
to
do
that
,
the
b
one
b
ones
cancel
,
the
b
two
b
ones
give
minus
b
three
,
and
then
the
b
three
,
b
one
,
gives
you
minus
b
two
,
and
then
everything
is
moved
over
to
the
other
side
.
so
,
we
have
,
like
before
i
'll
make
a
dot
equal
to
this
,
that
's
like
a
single
rigidbody
.
i
have
dropped
l
at
this
point
saying
,
'let
's
look
at
a
torque-free
motion
case
'
,
and
the
rest
of
the
gyroscopics
are
also
brought
over
to
the
right-hand
side
to
those
are
the
wheel
gyroscopics
that
come
in
.
if
you
change
the
wheel
speed
,
you
get
some
effect
along
b
one
.
if
you
just
are
spinning
and
you
're
tumbling
with
the
spacecraft
and
your
wheel
is
spinning
and
you
're
tumbling
,
there
's
some
cross
coupling
terms
that
appear
in
here
.
alight
?
but
that
's
it
.
i
have
now
derived
the
equations
of
a
dual-spinner
where
the
spin
rate
does
n't
even
have
to
be
constant
.
so
,
let
's
look
at
this
more
.
this
is
written
in
a
complete
tensor
notation
,
so
this
does
n't
have
to
be
a
principal
frame
actually
.
this
still
works
even
without
that
assumption
.
but
if
we
assume
it
's
a
principle
frame
,
we
can
write
this
as
a
diagonal
.
this
other
part
,
omega
till
the
i
omega
,
if
this
i
is
a
diagonal
,
it
simplifies
like
with
a
single
rigidbody
.
and
the
other
terms
,
we
had
something
in
the
b
one
,
two
,
and
three
direction
,
we
can
rewrite
into
this
.
this
is
the
gyroscopics
of
having
a
spinning
or
accelerating
wheel
there
.
that
's
how
it
impacts
a
spacecraft
.
