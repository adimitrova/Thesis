okay
now
we
were
looking
at
an
old
nominal
big
omega.zero
.
the
wheel
's
not
accelerating
.
we
do
n't
launch
that
way
.
we
launch
with
everything
locked
down
and
then
we
release
it
.
and
in
fact
,
the
craft
will
have
some
spin
after
it
gets
kicked
off
.
and
then
we
engaged
its
wheel
and
momentum
happens
and
how
does
it
settle
in
the
end
as
you
're
spinning
up
?
there
are
some
classic
answers
we
can
go
through
.
so
to
begin
with
,
what
's
commonly
done
with
these
dual
spinners
,
they
're
released
where
it
's
spinning
about
an
axis
that
's
not
aligned
with
the
wheel
.
wheel
was
aligned
with
b1
,
so
the
spacecraft
,
let
's
assume
it
's
spinning
about
b2
or
b3
or
some
combination
thereof
,
something
orthogonal
to
b1
.
so
we
want
it
to
be
doing
this
in
the
end
,
spinning
skinny
,
but
right
now
it
's
just
doing
this
kind
of
a
tumble
.
and
then
the
reaction
wheel
is
spun
up
.
if
this
is
spinning
,
and
it
has
inertia
of
one
,
and
a
spin
rate
of
one
,
then
inertia
times
spin
rate
gives
momentum
of
one
.
just
non
dimensional
units
.
i
'm
going
to
spin
up
my
wheel
until
its
momentum
magnitude
matches
that
of
the
space
craft
after
launch
which
is
one
in
this
case
,
right
?
now
,
in
this
kind
of
a
dynamical
system
is
is
the
angular
momentum
vector
conserved
?
tony
.
>

no
,
because
there
's
a
torque
being
applied
to
spin
up
.
>

right
.
there
's
a
torque
.
but
the
torque
is
applied
between
which
two
bodies
?

the
wheel
and
the
spacecraft

so

that
an

.
so
there
is
still
no
external
torque
.
so
for
the
combined
hub
and
wheel
system
,
the
total
momentum
vector
which
is
what
we
[
laugh
]
used
to
derive
the
equations
of
motion
like
h
dot
equal
to
l.
that
h
still
has
to
be
fixed
as
seen
by
inertial
observer
.
so
we
can
use
that
.
so
then
we
want
to
really
study
what
happens
to
the
attitude
as
we
do
this
spin
up
,
right
?
and
we
're
going
to
go
through
this
.
so
the
initial
spin
rate
,
we
said
,
we
're
tumbling
here
,
right
?
about
b2
,
just
without
loss
of
generality
,
i
'm
tumbling
at
a
rate
1
,
inertia
1
,
gives
me
momentum
1
,
that
's
what
i
have
here
.
and
spinning
up
the
momentum
of
the
wheel
relative
to
the
body
,
that
was
the
wheel
inertia
times
big
omega
.
big
omega
was
omega
of
wheel
relative
to
b
,
right
?
i
'm
simply
having
omega
dots
,
that
tells
me
how
little
h
is
changing
with
time
.
and
we
're
just
going
to
constantly
increase
it
right
now
.
we
're
not
doing
any
input
shaping
or
something
like
that
,
just
going
to
ramp
it
up
linearly
until
you
hit
the
desired
speed
.
and
the
desired
speed
will
make
little
h
be
equal
to
big
h
,
that
's
what
we
said
.
so
the
momentum
of
the
wheel
relative
to
the
craft
is
same
as
the
total
momentum
of
the
system
.
so
the
manuever
time
you
can
figure
it
out
.
well
at
the
end
i
have
to
have
this
much
.
that
's
my
constant
rate
.
you
can
quickly
compute
.
this
is
going
to
take
a
hundred
seconds
,
a
thousand
seconds
depending
on
how
quickly
you
're
ramping
up
your
wheel
speed
.
right
?
this
is
how
long
it
will
take
to
reach
this
total
amount
of
momentum
.
so
we
can
compute
that
.
nominally
we
had
launching
like
this
,
we
're
spinning
right
and
then
this
wheel
is
going
to
be
spinning
up
until
its
momentum
magnitude
matches
this
spacecraft
momentum
at
the
time
t0
,
and
this
is
going
to
line
up
.
or
is
it
?
we
argued
total
h
vector
has
to
be
constant
,
right
?
we
can
not
change
the
total
momentum
of
this
two
body
system
with
internal
torques
as
tony
was
saying
.
so
h
is
always
the
same
,
it
's
always
pointing
up
in
this
drawing
.
if
the
wheel
momentum
is
the
same
as
the
spacecraft
initial
momentum
,
and
the
wheel
is
spinning
about
this
axis
.
since
the
total
momentum
is
the
momentum
of
the
spacecraft
plus
the
momentum
of
the
wheel
,
does
n't
that
mean
the
spacecraft
is
despun
,
like
what
nathan
was
talking
about
?
and
it
must
be
lined
up
this
way
.
now
,
the
way
i
'm
asking
that
question
,
obviously
the
answer
is
no
,
right
?
the
trick
is
why
?
why
?
what
are
the
other
attitudes
that
allow
you
to
have
little
h
be
equal
to
big
h
,
but
i
'm
not
lining
up
perfectly
.
onzo
,
what
do
you
think
?
>
>
i
ca
n't
think
of
anything
off
the
top
of
my
head
.
>
>
any
ideas
?
think
of
this
.
right
now
we
've
been
talking
about
magnitudes
.
what
we
have
to
add
up
really
is
vectors
,
the
ang
momentum
vector
of
the
body
plus
the
ang
momentum
vector
of
the
wheels
.
yes
?
>

depending
on
the
direction
that
you

well
no
,
we
are
spinning
up

okay
,
so
you
are
assuming

>
it
's
locked
in
,
and
we
're
there
,
right
.
but
it
is
dependent
on
the
direction
of
these
vectors
.
just
because
little
h
is
equal
to
the
magnitude
of
the
initial
big
h
does
n't
mean
the
two
directions
have
to
be
the
same
.
and
that
's
essentially
,
this
is
our
initial
h
that
we
have
,
this
system
.
this
is
how
we
launched
,
wheels
were
locked
down
,
then
we
're
speeding
it
up
.
and
,
at
the
ends
the
wheel
has
a
vector
magnitude
that
is
the
same
as
the
initial
magnitude
of
the
system
.
little
h
was
equal
to
big
h
,
those
are
the
scalars
.
but
you
could
have
two
vectors
that
have
the
same
magnitude
but
not
be
in
the
same
direction
.
and
then
this
is
actually
what
the
spacecraft
body
must
be
doing
.
so
this
momentum
vector
plus
this
one
add
up
to
be
the
same
as
the
original
.
we
argue
we
can
not
change
initial
momentum
.
so
,
by
doing
this
maneuver
,
we
're
not
guaranteed
,
we
,
typically
,
when
spacecraft
launched
this
way
,
they
want
it
to
line
up
like
this
.
we
talked
about
the
boeing
501s
.
they
have
geostats
that
always
point
at
the
earth
,
skinny
ones
like
this
.
you
want
them
to
be
nice
and
even
.
they
're
not
doing
this
big
wobble
.
they
call
this
coning
motion
.
this
is
your
coning
angle
that
you
can
see
right
here
.
so
we
'd
like
it
to
be
zero
,
but
it
's
not
typically
zero
when
it
happens
.
and
there
's
different
ways
to
explain
what
is
happening
,
but
basically
this
momentum
matching
guarantee
does
n't
enforce
that
those
two
things
actually
line
up
.
now
the
analysis
of
this
gets
rather
complicated
.
typically
we
have
to
,
now
i
will
show
you
some
numerical
results
to
kind
of
talk
about
this
.
we
do
n't
have
nice
analytic
answers
to
guarantee
these
behaviors
,
but
we
can
study
this
stuff
.
i
mean
there
's
lots
of
theories
behind
this
but
i
'm
giving
it
a
spin
.
initially
with
tom
blake
you
're
not
omega
2
but
omega
3
for
30
degrees
per
second
.
have
wheel
inertia
,
spacecraft
stuff
,
everything
's
locked
down
.
this
gives
me
an
initial
big
h
,
momentum
.
and
now
i
'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
start
spinning
up
that
wheel
at
a
constant
rate
.
so
i
just
took
the
equations
of
motion
you
saw
earlier
,
last
class
,
and
i
'm
integrating
them
with
these
initial
conditions
and
also
tracking
the
attitude
.
i
'm
not
just
tracking
omega
but
i
used
euler
angles
and
,
i
forget
what
i
used
,
something
,
maybe
mrps
.
and
at
two
hundred
seconds
,
i
have
finished
that
maneuver
.
and
you
saw
then
at
two
hundred
seconds
,
we
were
close
to
being
lined
up
like
this
.
but
there
was
still
a
little
bit
of
a
wobble
left
,
that
happens
there
.
and
so
that
amount
of
wobble
,
that
's
what
's
happening
with
these
amplitudes
here
.
we
can
predict
that
now
and
see
what
's
happening
.
so
we
get
close
but
not
quite
there
.
here
i
'm
taking
a
thousand
seconds
,
because
i
'm
taking
a
lot
more
time
.
so
it
'll
take
about
a
minute
to
run
and
you
can
see
all
these
simulations
running
and
it
keeps
wobbling
and
spinning
.
but
it
's
a
much
more
gradual
process
.
so
what
's
going
to
happen
now
in
this
process
is
it
'll
take
,
obviously
takes
more
time
to
roll
up
,
but
if
you
look
at
the
final
omega
two
's
before
it
was
like
plus
minus
seven
degrees
and
even
these
axis
were
bigger
,
we
will
have
less
of
a
coning
angle
at
the
end
of
this
maneuver
.
so
when
it
gets
close
there
we
'll
want
to
take
a
look
at
that
.
and
that
's
the
general
trends
we
have
in
these
systems
.
with
a
dual
spinner
we
're
just
spinning
it
up
,
we
do
n't
want
to
be
too
aggressive
because
you
end
up
with
this
huge
momentum
vector
off
to
the
side
.
you
really
have
,
then
you
have
to
do
other
stuff
.
you
want
to
have
a
coning
angle
as
small
as
possible
so
a
little
patience
goes
a
long
way
.
take
a
little
bit
longer
to
spin
this
thing
up
and
at
that
point
,
you
have
a
smaller
coning
angle
.
so
it
will
get
there
.
we
're
about
halfway
there
.
the
way
we
get
rid
of
this
coning
angle
,
you
could
use
thrusters
,
in
the
end
if
you
want
to
change
the
attitude
.
you
could
apply
h
dot
equal
to
l
,
apply
some
thrusters
,
in
the
right
control
.
and
change
that
momentum
vector
of
the
body
,
and
puff
it
back
into
place
.
but
now
we
're
using
fuel
,
we
hate
using
fuel
in
space
.
there
's
an
elegant
method
that
people
have
devised
which
called
the
mutation
damper
.
anybody
heard
of
a
mutation
damper
before
?
no
?
what
it
does
is
you
put
basically
a
ball
in
a
tube
of
slush
,
oil
,
something
highly
viscous
.
so
it
creates
friction
.
so
we
're
losing
energy
.
all
right
?
and
what
we
want
to
have
is
spin
about
omega
one
in
the
end
and
so
you
make
that
damper
,
you
line
up
that
tube
of
slush
along
either
b2
or
3.
so
if
you
're
still
wobbling
with
the
conic
motion
,
you
're
always
actually
exciting
that
slosh
,
and
you
're
losing
energy
.
and
then
people
have
shown
this
stuff
,
at
the
end
it
would
actually
get
rid
of
the
coning
motion
completely
.
and
that
goes
there
.
we
've
used
this
as
a
50
turn
project
in
the
past
where
people
have
to
integrate
this
and
study
the
spin
up
and
go
through
that
.
it
's
a
fun
project
actually
.
so
take
away
notes
is
spin
up
,
just
because
you
match
momentum
magnitudes
does
n't
mean
you
've
matched
the
vectors
.
teaching
those
vectors
and
patience
goes
a
long
way
.
to
get
rid
of
the
coning
angle
,
you
want
to
put
a
mutation
damper
orthogonal
.
that
'll
get
rid
of
the
energies
of
these
modes
here
over
time
,
and
it
'll
settle
in
place
.
and
there
's
all
kinds
of
,
you
can
look
up
mutation
dampers
.
but
here
's
the
results
.
so
with
two
hundred
seconds
you
see
where
you
are
.
a
thousand
seconds
,
you
know
,
five
times
longer
,
we
've
improved
it
by
a
factor
of
two
.
there
's
really
,
it
's
an
asintotic
thing
.
so
if
you
want
to
get
even
closer
,
you
might
take
a
long
time
.
that
's
where
,
how
patient
are
you
,
you
know
.
a
little
bit
of
mutation
damping
can
go
a
long
way
,
and
get
rid
of
the
coning
motion
.
other
things
are
,
we
've
seen
plots
.
i
'm
just
going
to
go
through
this
,
reasonably
high-level
.
but
just
to
show
you
,
plots
have
also
been
applied
not
just
for
rigid
bodies
,
but
also
systems
of
rigid
bodies
like
these
wheels
and
dual
spinners
.
the
energy
here
,
this
is
really
the
energy
of
the
spacecraft
only
,
here
,
not
the
real
energy
relative
to
the
spacecraft
.
so
not
the
part
with
i
w
over
two
,
big
omega
squared
.
so
that
's
called
e
star
.
the
total
momentum
energy
of
the
system
is
as
before
,
the
momentum
sphere
just
has
to
be
constant
,
even
with
internal
torques
acting
because
they
're
internal
.
they
're
not
changing
the
total
momentum
of
the
system
.
which
is
kind
of
nice
,
that
's
a
constraint
.
so
we
can
rewrite
the
energy
ellipsoid
of
the
spacecraft
in
terms
of
these
coordinates
.
and
with
a
little
math
this
is
how
you
,
this
is
what
you
come
up
with
.
so
because
the
energy
that
you
have
,
the
momentum
about
the
one
axis
is
due
to
the
wheel
and
due
to
the
spacecraft
,
so
you
have
to
pull
out
the
wheel
momentum
.
and
then
divide
by
the
right
stuff
to
come
up
with
the
energy
terms
of
the
spacecraft
about
the
one
axis
.
the
two
and
three
axis
look
like
before
.
but
this
is
a
sphere
,
this
is
still
an
ellipsoid
,
but
it
's
a
shifted
ellipsoid
.
if
your
h
one
two
threes
are
essentially
your
x
,
y
,
z
,
independent
coordinates
.
if
you
go
look
up
the
classic
ellipsoidal
equation
.
if
you
did
n't
have
minus
h
this
would
be
a
centered
ellipsoid
that
's
there
,
and
with
the
minus
h
,
it
actually
shifts
that
ellipsoid
along
the
one
access
.
so
as
we
spin
up
the
wheel
that
energy
ellipsoid
is
going
to
move
.
and
that
's
what
you
see
here
.
initially
we
launched
the
spacecraft
spin
is
here
.
we
were
spinning
purely
about
b3
in
that
numerical
problem
i
showed
you
.
then
as
we
spin
up
the
wheel
you
can
see
these
are
the
momentum
coordinates
that
we
have
to
satisfy
.
that
's
the
total
momentum
coordinates
of
the
spacecraft
.
it
intersects
energy
in
here
.
and
the
energy
ellipsoid
starts
to
shrink
inside
and
of
the
spacecraft
cause
as
we
spin
up
the
wheel
the
spacecraft
tends
to
de-spin
and
change
it
's
orientation
.
although
momentum
we
'd
like
it
to
go
into
the
wheels
.
so
there
's
different
critical
points
.
at
one
point
this
ellypsoid
intercepts
in
this
nice
figure
eight
motion
.
this
kind
of
a
separate
trick
stuff
that
we
've
seen
with
rigid
bodies
.
and
then
when
the
momentum
magnitude
matches
,
this
is
what
you
end
up
with
.
just
because
you
match
momentum
magnitudes
does
n't
guarantee
that
you
've
despun
the
primary
body
completely
.
and
this
is
where
a
mutation
damper
would
help
get
rid
of
that
remaining
energy
and
make
that
actually
attractive
and
collapse
onto
a
point
.
and
that
's
what
would
be
happening
there
.
so
i
'm
just
kind
of
showing
this
more
as
a
pictorial
thing
.
so
you
've
seen
this
.
it
's
not
something
that
'll
be
on
the
exam
.
but
these
plots
,
these
graphical
visualizations
of
momentum
and
energy
are
quite
powerful
.
and
if
you
read
a
lot
of
classical
attitude
control
,
you
will
see
these
kind
of
tools
being
used
in
different
areas
.
