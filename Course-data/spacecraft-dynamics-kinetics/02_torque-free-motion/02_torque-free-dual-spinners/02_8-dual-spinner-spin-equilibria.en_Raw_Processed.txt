now, lets look this 
going to start to is, 
talk stability 
soon we talk stability, 
we always talk small 
departures right 
this is an equilibrium 
this is an equilibrium 
equilibrium nothing 
to stability 
equilibrium means, 
if i put particular side state 
theta is equal to degrees, if i 
measuring this is zero, this would 
happens if i small 
motions stability 
equilibrium means, 
if you this this particular state, 
state rates will go to 
x go to 
we spin stability 
a single rigid body, going to 
look conditions will this 
vanish, if i nt this 
if i this, you see, 
conditions will omega , 
, dot go to zero 
one case is course trivial, 
you make rates 
that exactly a spinning condition, 
going to a trivial solution 
if you something else though, 
way you make general 
inertias, way you make 
three terms go to zero is 
andre 
axisymmetric 
doesnt to axis, 
we look axisymmetric 
if axisymmetric one 
axis, this could go to says, 
omega is constant, right 
then, you to make two 
go to if omega is a non value 
way vanish, 
inertias cause 
spherical symmetry, is omega 
omega would to zero, right 
thats one way, yes 
general inertias, if inertia 
differences never zero, howd you make 
three go to zero without 
three omegas go to zero 
to big omega inaudible 
well, 
we dont big omega right 
lets ignore real 
if you single rigid body 
spencer 
would you spin 
axis maximum inertia 
then, spinning 
two axes 
you could 
in fact, 
you could spin 
principal axes 
if omega is nonzero, lets say 
omega axis maximum inertia 
omega is nonzero, this is nonzero 
omega is 
i got times , something finite times , 
is also something times , 
right vanishes 
this is we identify quickly 
mathematics three equilibrium 
spins general inertia is 
appears spin to b, b b 
also we saw graphically 
in pole hole plots 
we discussed several different ways, 
right 
three spin equilibrius 
in real life, we dont spin 
spacecraft around intermediate axis 
leased axis we to worry 
anticipation chaotic behavior 
so, really limits design to 
spin axis max inertia 
geostationary satellites tend to tall, 
boeing i believe big 
tubular shapes want to spin so 
theyre always pointing earth 
so, want to spin 
least axis inertia 
we know is an issue energy 
loss, always pointing earth 
so, this dual spinner allows us 
to spin actually axis 
i could even spin dual spin 
axis intermediate inertia 
right spin conditions 
well develop i make stable 
so this is a way to provide passive 
stability without dual spinner, 
you could long term spin 
axis max inertia 
wheel we add this stuff 
we look mathematics 
i show you that we 
equilibrias 
conditions if we 
pick right wheel speeds, 
i make one 
stable without feedback 
so rigid body, 
we to spin b, , 
equilibrias 
now, lets 
exercise a wheel 
going to say this 
wheel a dual spinner, 
nominal case is wheel 
is moving a constant rate 
that means omega dot vanishes 
now, i want to find an equilibrium, 
is omega dot, dot, dot 
im going to non omega , 
s, 
i dont want everything to stationary 
thats back to trivial answer, 
i also want to a non omega 
we make that work 
cough 
right, 
you kind basically 
go deductions 
like sherlock holmes, 
you deduct cant possible 
whatever is left, however improbably, 
must answer, right 
so if we start here, this is already 
zero a constant wheel speed 
way to make this zero, again, 
looking general inertia still, 
in this case, is either to omega 
to zero 
okay, lets pick omega 
right 
start deduction 
if omega is zero, 
this is going to 
this is a finite wheel speed 
times going to 
you go hey, i like this 
okay 
now, omega 
if this is going to go to , 
you could make omega , 
if we dont want 
three to 
if you make omega , 
omega to 
this term goes to 
omega times something 
if omega is , 
you nonzero times nonzero 
you dont get a second 
derivative omegas 
a zero derivative second omega 
so, that wouldnt work 
so, instead you see 
is you make omega two zero 
that vanishes, cancels this, 
makes this zero 
way you make this one zero 
is to take omega three thats zero 
even if omega one is non zero 
doesnt matter 
wheel nonzero, 
doesnt matter 
theyre multiplied 
times something zero 
so, thats going to equilibrium 
you notice first axis is also, so 
i an omega one thats nonzero 
that one axis is also axis 
thats a spin axis wheel 
thats this came 
axis, 
you cant really make this work 
i could picked omega three, 
went logic, you end 
answer this stuff 
so, instead able to spin 
equlibrias principle axes 
space craft a dual spinner, 
youre constrained to 
an equilibria 
spin axis wheel 
if i a tumble omega 
omega i end here 
cross coupling terms that will give 
non derivatives right that wouldnt 
an equilibrium spin would 
a general tumble that you would 
so, yes ansel 
you talking this 
passive you would need kind 
big bigger right 
if you to actually carry this 
you would spin 
well get to spin part in a few 
slides, probably tuesday next week 
here weve 
axed spin condition 
then, you a little motor 
that keeps spinning a fixed rate 
theres external feedback that says 
look stars, look horizon, 
look everything stabilize 
holding a fixed speed 
thats 
big omegadot zero 
yes, so dual spinner, 
nominal case is big omega dot to zero
