a review 
we covered last time 
we dual spinners 
so a dual spinner, 
i spacecraft, 
didnt necessarily to symmetric 
this spacecraft b, b, 
b 
youd panel attached to 
so now, nathan 
we dual spinner 
whats set that we here 
well you one section spinning 
to maintain angular momentum 
or, so spinning axis 
minimum energy, so maximum inertia 
okay 
section is 
spinning essentially 
is that required 
we to spin an axis 
a minimum inertia 
second section to despun 
i guess 
no, in fact thats im going 
to show today an example 
we stabilize is 
beauty dual spinners 
i make axis stable 
if you energy loss minimum 
inertia one you to kind 
a little bit careful theres 
power equations you find 
this stuff 
conceptually, we know without 
energy loss this is a stable spin 
this is a stable spin 
a spin access 
intermediate act inertia tends to 
flip around unstable, right 
so, a dual spinner in this 
mathematics, we a fly wheel 
we line up, brett, we line 
this fly wheel in dual spinner 
one body axis 
yeah, one principal ones 
so, if we wanted to a nominal spin 
here, omega, thats equilibrium spin 
i going to add a wheel, 
a spin axis, going to call gshat, 
thats wheel spin axis, 
is thing b 
lined 
good, we went through, 
we find equations motion 
we still use h equal to l 
h is due to two rigid bodies 
theres different ways to derive 
we went that last time 
theres angular momentum space 
craft wheel that i, 
that a summed i times omega plus 
wheel momentum routed to spacecraft 
you treat two separate 
ones, i showed you that well 
you combine 
thats a great problem that ive 
used in final so 
make sure you go that 
a good simple exercise 
later in class, you spacecraft 
within variable speed cmgs 
process 
pages algebra 
so this is you want 
to practice process so 
you dont get silly sign errors 
rest 
kind becomes mechanical 
im going to this, 
im going to this, 
you use computer 
tools well to that 
so practice this 
so we went this 
i labeled this an equilibrium 
spin omega e, right 
mean mandar 
to in equilibrium spin 
that mean 
cough 
omega dots go to 
exactly, dynamical system, 
flow process whatever you have, if you 
x dot equal to f, a nonlinear thing, 
inaudible xe is x dot equal to 
planar pendulum one 
equilibrium here, one equilibrium here 
this anything to 
stability, finding equilibrius 
no, a convenient point 
we tend to discuss stability 
stability is a separate concept 
finding equilibrius, right 
so we found equilibrius 
in particularly 
single rigid body there three 
equilibrium spins we discussed earlier 
spinning axis least inertia, 
maximum inertia, 
also intermediate inertia 
equilibrium spins 
if you put perfectly 
there would tumble that way 
if you bump it, if you perturb it, 
that little delta that we talking 
earlier, you stay close 
happens to spin rates 
right, i wobble a little bit 
stay there, is true 
this kind a thing 
if i throw this way you see 
several gyrations right away, 
thats an unstable motion, right 
thats 
so good, so 
we identified while single rigid 
body could equilibrium 
spins three axis 
duel spinner 
equilibrium spins we end 
using is primarily 
one gs axis 
i say primarily, 
lets look that equation 
sound 
here, 
we argue that if i a non 
omega omega , 
i always dots 
omega dots going to 
like mandar saying earlier 
perfect, 
you also omega e non 
omega e is 
makes this this 
you could pick particular inertias, a 
particular e a particular wheel speed, 
that this combination a non 
omega e actually goes to well 
thats also an equilibrium, 
one we typically fly, 
a sudden you 
a particular solution 
you to exactly this wheel speed 
if youre a little bit fast, 
little bit lower, 
youre that equilibrium part 
whereas this spin we if this 
wheel speed is supposed to rpm 
i put in rpm still 
an equilibrium actually 
still going to hold stair 
so, we that, here we added 
is equilibrium plus delta 
dropped tie terms, right 
you end 
differential equations 
that stable, 
if you see here, 
if instead putting in that rpm 
i gave something slightly faster 
perturbed, this hold that speed 
angular acceleration 
one axis, 
spin axis wheel, is 
so you stay there 
two, tends to couple 
we two first order differential 
equations that coupled 
way we solve was, 
we differentiate again, substitute in 
so we replaced two coupled differential 
equations one second order decoupled 
differential equation, in end, 
two bracketed terms 
this is effective stiffness 
x doubled plus k x, 
k to positive right 
either we make this positive 
this positive 
we make bracketed terms negative 
different ways we write 
well in that example today, 
you will see omega hat thats 
a nondimensionalized 
we take wheel speed, rpm, 
divide spacecraft speed, rpm, so 
megahat would in this case 
a multiplier factor between 
spacecraft spin wheel spin 
breaks to 
inertias that you need 
you to pick spin speeds 
that terms positive, 
terms negative 
if you put in spin speed we recover 
case a single rigid body 
thats we quickly found that this 
stiffness is going to positive if 
inertia is either maximum inertia, 
that means flat spin we 
discussed earlier pole hose 
b is access least inertia 
least linearly without 
energy loss is also stable 
so you see in here also mathematical 
linearized proof stability 
min max inertia case 
intermediate one gets positive 
negative, definitely stable 
non one in 
nondimensionalized terms 
conditions we need
