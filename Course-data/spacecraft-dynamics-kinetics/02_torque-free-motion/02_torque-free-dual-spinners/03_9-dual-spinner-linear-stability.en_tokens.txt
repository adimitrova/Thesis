so
these
are
the
equilibrias
we
're
trying
to
identify
.
when
are
-
if
i
have
equilibrium
states
,
it
's
like
with
the
pendulum
,
right
?
theta
zero
was
an
equilibrium
,
180
was
an
equilibrium
.
and
then
you
can
look
at
180
plus
deltas
,
right
,
to
look
at
small
departures
.
with
the
omegas
,
i
'm
saying
i
have
some
omegas
equilibrium
spin
,
and
then
i
can
look
at
small
departures
.
what
if
i
'm
wobbling
slightly
off
axis
?
do
things
stay
close
or
does
things
go
crazy
?
right
,
that
would
be
unstable
.
so
if
you
look
at
equilibrium
conditions
,
we
'd
make
the
big
omega
dot
equal
to
zero
.
i
've
basically
rewritten
it
,
but
instead
of
just
having
omega
one
,
two
,
threes
,
it
's
omega
e1
,
2
and
3s
to
highlight
these
equilibrium
conditions
.
and
what
came
out
of
this
was
that
we
had
to
have
this
condition
,
essentially
.
the
spacecraft
has
to
be
spinning
about
the
same
axis
as
the
wheel
.
the
other
two
have
to
be
zero
.
then
all
my
omega
e1
,
2s
,
and
3
dots
become
zero
.
that
's
an
equilibrium
.
so
now
we
're
going
to
look
at
small
departures
.
so
we
're
using
linear
stability
analysis
.
it
is
-
if
you
have
n't
done
too
much
of
this
,
this
is
nothing
but
a
basically
spring
mass
damper-like
system
in
the
end
.
right
?
once
we
linearize
about
this
motion
,
you
end
up
with
something
plus
cx
dot
plus
kx
,
and
then
from
then
we
can
argue
stability
.
so
the
angular
accelerations
,
if
you
put
dots
on
everything
,
you
would
just
have
your
nominal
spins
plus
the
departures
.
and
we
know
,
for
our
equilibriums
,
the
nominal
spins
about
two
and
three
are
actually
going
to
be
zero
.
this
one
could
be
none
,
or
at
the
equilibrium
,
it
has
to
be
zero
.
omega
e2
is
going
to
be
zero
.
e3
is
going
to
be
zero
.
this
one
is
going
to
be
a
non-zero
value
.
this
is
going
to
be
a
non-zero
.
so
you
just
plug
in
the
terms
and
one
-
there
's
different
ways
you
can
linearize
.
later
on
,
we
'll
do
taylor
series
expansions
and
come
up
with
first
order
terms
.
here
,
i
'm
just
plugging
it
in
.
i
see
delta
times
delta
,
that
's
second
order
,
i
drop
it
.
if
you
have
omega
e1
,
that
's
some
number
times
a
delta
;
well
,
that
's
still
first
order
,
i
keep
it
.
first
order
times
zero
;
well
,
that
's
definitely
zero
,
right
?
and
you
drop
it
.
but
that
's
basically
what
you
do
when
you
run
through
these
.
these
equilibrias
are
both
zero
and
only
have
first
order
terms
.
so
you
can
run
.
and
in
your
homeworks
,
you
've
also
do
some
linearizations
.
if
you
now
drop
all
the
second
order
or
the
zero
terms
,
this
is
what
you
end
up
with
a
dual
spinner
.
so
right
away
,
this
looks
a
little
bit
like
the
axisymmetric
case
we
covered
,
where
we
had
two
inertias
being
equal
and
whatever
was
the
axis
of
symmetry
,
the
spin
rate
about
that
axis
ended
up
being
constant
,
while
the
other
ones
you
could
wobble
and
we
had
sines
and
cosine
answers
.
here
,
in
this
mathematics
,
we
have
our
departure
.
this
is
not
my
nominal
spin
rate
.
this
is
my
delta
omega
one
.
so
if
i
'm
supposed
to
be
spinning
at
one
degree
per
second
,
but
somebody
kicked
it
off
with
one
point
one
degree
per
second
,
right
,
then
you
're
delta
omega
one
is
point
one
degree
per
second
.
this
tells
me
how
does
that
point
one
degree
per
second
change
with
time
.
and
it
turns
out
,
it
does
n't
.
so
if
you
're
spinning
off
a
dual
spinner
and
you
inject
it
into
that
orbit
and
instead
of
doing
360
degrees
per
day
,
if
it
's
doing
360.1
degrees
per
day
,
well
,
it
will
just
keep
doing
that
.
so
we
call
this
kind
of
a
marginal
stability
.
it
does
n't
grow
,
it
does
n't
shrink
.
it
does
n't
do
anything
.
it
's
just
flat
lines
there
.
it
's
not
-
so
it
does
n't
recover
itself
if
it
's
off
.
it
does
n't
get
closer
again
at
some
point
like
that
.
so
if
you
-
if
you
were
n't
happy
with
that
behavior
,
you
probably
would
need
some
active
control
to
nudge
it
and
get
it
within
your
tolerances
.
i
have
to
have
a
drift
rate
that
's
less
than
one
thousandth
of
a
degree
per
day
or
something
,
you
know
,
to
always
be
pointing
at
the
earth
.
so
-
so
dual
spinner
does
n't
give
you
any
passive
stabilizing
component
.
it
does
n't
make
it
go
unstable
,
it
just
-
whatever
air
you
have
,
that
's
what
you
stick
with
.
that
's
one
way
to
look
at
this
.
now
the
other
two
,
again
,
omega
e1
,
that
's
our
nominal
spin
rate
.
360
per
day
,
that
's
one
rev
per
day
like
a
geo
satellite
would
have
to
do
.
these
are
the
departure
motions
and
you
can
see
that
my
departure
spin
rate
about
the
second
axis
is
a
function
only
of
delta
omega
three
.
so
delta
omega
two
dot
depends
on
delta
omega
three
and
delta
omega
three
dot
depends
on
delta
omega
two
.
the
wheel
speeds
are
just
constants
that
we
hold
here
.
so
we
have
two
coupled
first
order
differential
equations
.
matt
,
do
you
remember
our
trick
we
had
earlier
?
how
to
solve
two
coupled
first
order
differential
equations
?
you
take
the
derivative
from
it
?
exactly
.
we
want
to
get
rid
of
the
derivatives
to
find
-
or
find
an
answer
to
this
,
and
it
turns
out
it
's
often
easier
to
first
differentiate
again
.
and
that
's
what
we
're
gon
na
do
.
because
if
i
take
the
derivative
of
this
,
all
of
this
is
nothing
but
constant
.
my
nominal
speed
is
a
fixed
value
.
it
's
supposed
to
be
doing
360
per
day
,
right
?
this
is
a
fixed
wheel
speed
;
inertias
are
fixed
.
so
everything
is
a
constant
.
so
i
only
have
delta
omega
three
dot
.
then
,
when
i
take
this
derivative
,
i
can
plug
in
this
equation
and
get
one
second
order
differential
equation
.
very
similar
to
what
we
did
mathematically
with
that
single
spacecraft
axisymmetric
case
.
so
if
i
do
this
,
i
took
its
derivative
,
all
this
is
constant
,
you
get
this
,
plug
in
the
other
equation
,
you
end
up
with
this
one
.
now
this
should
look
very
nice
because
this
is
basically
-
instead
of
delta
omega
two
as
a
variable
,
just
call
it
x
,
and
you
end
up
with
x
double
dot
plus
kx
equal
to
zero
.
and
if
you
have
any
information
about
a
spring
mass
system
,
the
only
way
this
is
going
to
be
stable
and
give
you
oscillatory
part
,
is
you
have
to
have
positive
stiffness
.
all
right
?
so
we
have
to
design
this
k.
this
is
not
really
a
spring
,
this
is
just
a
mathematical
coefficient
that
comes
out
of
this
-
this
dynamical
system
.
so
we
have
to
pick
inertias
and
spins
and
nominal
things
such
that
k
is
going
to
be
positive
.
right
?
that
's
going
to
give
us
stability
for
the
other
two
axes
.
the
first
axis
is
just
going
to
be
marginal
.
that
's
all
you
get
.
now
,
in
this
case
,
i
have
different
ways
to
break
it
down
.
essentially
,
you
have
one
bracketed
term
times
a
second
bracketed
term
.
it
has
to
be
positive
.
so
lucas
,
what
can
you
say
about
the
signs
of
the
bracketed
terms
?
what
must
be
true
of
them
for
this
to
be
stable
?
they
have
to
cancel
with
each
other
.
how
do
you
cancel
?
what
would
you
mean
by
canceling
sines
?
does
this
first
bracketed
term
have
to
be
positive
or
negative
?
and
what
the
second
bracketed
term
has
to
be
?
not
sure
.
all
right
.
we
want
the
product
of
two
terms
to
be
positive
.
so
what
must
be
true
of
the
elements
of
that
product
?
they
're
both
positive
or
both
negative
.
right
.
as
long
as
they
're
the
same
sign
,
we
are
good
.
do
n't
just
jump
right
to
well
,
this
-
if
this
has
to
be
positive
,
this
has
to
be
positive
,
this
has
to
be
positive
.
that
's
not
quite
true
.
that
's
a
condition
,
but
it
's
not
the
only
condition
.
either
we
have
positive-positive
,
which
is
stability
,
or
positive-negative
,
sorry
,
negative-negative
,
which
is
stability
.
what
you
do
n't
want
to
do
is
have
positive
times
negative
.
that
would
definitely
be
an
unstable
situation
.
all
right
?
and
that
's
-
that
's
essentially
,
with
all
the
math
,
that
's
what
it
breaks
down
.
so
now
,
if
we
have
some
inertias
and
we
have
some
nominal
spin
rate
,
i
want
to
spin
about
this
axis
at
two
rpm
,
50
rpm
,
whatever
you
're
doing
,
what
allowable
wheel
speeds
do
i
have
to
guarantee
i
have
positive
stiffness
?
all
right
?
this
is
what
it
boils
down
to
.
so
we
can
rewrite
this
different
ways
from
this
parameter
here
,
k
,
i
can
factor
out
omega
e1
.
that
means
i
divide
this
wheel
speed
by
the
nominal
spacecraft
spin
rate
and
that
's
what
's
omega
hat
.
you
see
,
omega
hat
is
just
a
normalized
version
of
the
wheel
speed
.
so
if
this
is
point
one
,
that
means
your
wheel
is
rotating
at
10
percent
of
the
spacecraft
speed
.
if
it
's
four
,
you
're
rotating
four
times
faster
than
the
spacecraft
speed
.
that
's
one
way
to
look
at
it
,
it
's
a
convenient
way
.
and
then
we
factored
out
some
other
inertias
and
brought
it
back
together
.
this
number
squared
is
always
going
to
be
positive
inertias
,
or
hopefully
positive
.
otherwise
you
have
some
imaginary
system
.
i
'd
be
very
interested
in
seeing
that
.
but
then
you
're
back
to
bracket
times
bracket
.
but
there
's
no
more
ratios
.
it
's
a
little
bit
simpler
to
look
at
.
and
again
,
we
need
both
of
them
to
be
positive
or
both
of
them
to
be
negative
.
let
's
look
at
the
one
case
.
we
argued
stability
looking
at
pole
hold
plots
if
we
do
n't
have
a
wheel
spinning
,
right
?
so
if
we
lock
omega
hat
to
be
zero
,
we
've
got
nothing
but
one
rigid
body
and
we
should
be
able
to
recover
our
results
we
saw
from
the
pole
hold
plots
,
which
said
without
energy
loss
,
spins
about
least
inertia
were
stable
,
spins
about
max
inertia
were
stable
-
we
've
stayed
close
-
but
spins
about
intermediate
inertia
were
always
unstable
.
right
?
and
we
can
see
that
if
we
look
at
this
.
so
if
i
take
out
the
omega
hat
part
,
all
you
have
is
the
difference
between
i1
and
i3
and
i1
and
i2
.
and
you
can
readily
see
that
if
we
have
a
spin
about
max
inertia
,
if
b1
is
a
max
inertia
case
,
then
this
difference
has
to
be
positive
because
i1
is
the
biggest
one
,
so
negative
anything
else
is
going
to
still
be
above
zero
;
i1
minus
i2
also
has
to
be
positive
,
because
i1
is
larger
than
i2
;
so
positive-positive
.
as
we
predicted
with
the
pole
hold
plots
,
we
're
getting
a
stable
response
in
a
linear
sense
.
and
the
least
axis
of
inertia
,
if
i1
is
the
smallest
inertia
,
then
i1
minus
i3
will
be
negative
,
i1
minus
i2
will
be
negative
and
we
have
negative-negative
and
we
're
also
stable
.
that
's
the
axis
of
least
inertia
.
the
skinny
spin
.
so
linearly
,
they
look
stable
.
we
know
already
with
energy
loss
-
and
the
pole
holds
actually
gave
us
much
more
global
arguments
,
this
is
only
for
linearized
local
arguments
-
but
we
regained
the
results
that
we
had
earlier
.
again
,
this
is
a
classic
result
you
should
be
able
to
do
with
those
equations
.
so
let
's
look
at
non
.
this
is
the
condition
we
had
if
we
do
have
the
wheel
speed
.
so
there
's
always
two
sets
of
conditions
that
comes
out
of
this
.
either
we
pick
a
wheel
speed
such
that
this
is
bigger
than
zero
-
that
means
i1
has
to
be
bigger
than
this
part
,
so
i
bring
all
that
to
the
right-hand
side
and
that
's
what
you
have
here
-
or
i1
has
to
be
bigger
than
this
part
over
here
,
which
i
brought
to
the
right-hand
side
.
so
you
end
up
with
two
inequalities
.
and
both
of
them
have
to
be
satisfied
,
right
?
if
both
of
them
are
satisfied
,
you
are
positive-positive
.
if
instead
of
greater
than
,
if
i
flip
the
sine
and
say
well
if
this
one
is
less
than
,
that
makes
this
negative
,
this
is
less
than
,
that
makes
this
negative
.
so
it
's
the
same
boundary
points
.
if
you
make
it
equal
,
you
have
two
points
on
the
wheel
.
if
you
look
at
your
wheel
speed
spectrum
-
zero
's
in
the
middle
,
then
you
go
left
,
right
,
you
will
find
two
points
that
are
critical
,
where
one
bracketed
term
switches
sines
and
another
point
where
another
bracketed
term
switches
sines
.
once
you
've
identified
them
,
you
want
to
find
out
where
you
-
are
you
between
the
points
,
are
you
outside
of
those
points
?
what
is
the
domain
that
makes
it
stable
?
the
beauty
is
we
can
do
this
regardless
of
the
inertias
.
so
i
can
always
actually
enforce
this
condition
.
