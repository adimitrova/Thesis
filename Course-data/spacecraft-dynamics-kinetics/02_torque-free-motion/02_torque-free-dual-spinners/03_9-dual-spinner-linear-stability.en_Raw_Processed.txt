so equilibrias trying to identify 
if i equilibrium states, like pendulum, right 
theta zero an equilibrium, an equilibrium 
you look plus deltas, right, to look small departures 
omegas, im saying i omegas 
equilibrium spin, i look small departures 
if im wobbling slightly axis 
things stay close things go crazy 
right, that would unstable 
so if you look equilibrium conditions, wed make big omega dot equal to zero 
ive basically rewritten it, instead omega 
one, two, threes, omega e, to highlight equilibrium conditions 
came this that we to this condition, essentially 
spacecraft to spinning axis wheel 
two to zero 
omega e, s, dots become zero 
thats an equilibrium 
so going to look small departures 
so using linear stability analysis 
is if you havent done much this, this is nothing a basically spring mass 
damperlike system in end 
right 
we linearize this motion, you end something plus 
cx dot plus kx, we argue stability 
so angular accelerations, if you put dots everything, you would 
nominal spins plus departures 
we know, equilibriums, nominal spins two 
three actually going to zero 
this one could none, equilibrium, to zero 
omega e is going to zero 
e is going to zero 
this one is going to a nonzero value 
this is going to a nonzero 
so you plug in terms one theres different ways you linearize 
later on, well taylor series expansions come first order terms 
here, im plugging in 
i see delta times delta, thats second order, i drop 
if you omega e, thats number 
times a delta well, thats still first order, i keep 
first order times zero well, thats definitely zero, right 
you drop 
thats basically you you run 
equilibrias zero first order terms 
so you run 
in homeworks, youve also linearizations 
if you drop second order zero terms, 
this is you end a dual spinner 
so right away, this looks a little bit like axisymmetric case we covered, 
we two inertias equal whatever axis symmetry, 
spin rate that axis ended 
constant, while ones you could wobble 
we sines cosine answers 
here, in this mathematics, we departure 
this is nominal spin rate 
this is delta omega one 
so if im supposed to spinning one degree per second, 
somebody kicked one point one degree per second, 
right, youre delta omega one is point one degree per second 
this tells that point one degree per second change time 
turns out, doesnt 
so if youre spinning a dual spinner 
you inject that orbit 
instead degrees per day, if degrees per day, 
well, will keep that 
so we call this kind a marginal stability 
doesnt grow, doesnt shrink 
doesnt anything 
flat lines there 
so doesnt recover if 
doesnt get closer point like that 
so if you if you werent happy that behavior, 
you probably would need active control to nudge 
get within tolerances 
i to a drift rate thats less one thousandth a degree 
per day something, you know, to always pointing earth 
so so dual spinner doesnt give you passive stabilizing component 
doesnt make go unstable, 
whatever air you have, thats you stick 
thats one way to look this 
two, again, omega e, thats nominal spin rate 
per day, thats one rev per day like a geo satellite would to 
departure motions 
you see that departure spin rate 
second axis is a function delta omega three 
so delta omega two dot depends delta omega three 
delta omega three dot depends delta omega two 
wheel speeds constants that we hold here 
so we two coupled first order differential equations 
matt, you remember trick we earlier 
to solve two coupled first order differential equations 
you take derivative 
exactly 
we want to get rid derivatives to find 
find an answer to this, turns 
often easier to first differentiate 
thats gonna 
if i take derivative this, this is nothing constant 
nominal speed is a fixed value 
supposed to per day, right 
this is a fixed wheel speed inertias fixed 
so everything is a constant 
so i delta omega three dot 
then, i take this derivative, i plug in this equation 
get one second order differential equation 
similar to we mathematically that single spacecraft axisymmetric case 
so if i this, i took derivative, this is constant, 
you get this, plug in equation, you end this one 
this look nice this is basically 
instead delta omega two a variable, call x, 
you end x double dot plus kx equal to zero 
if you information a spring mass system, 
way this is going to stable 
give you oscillatory part, is you to positive stiffness 
right 
so we to design this k 
this is really a spring, this is a mathematical coefficient 
that comes this this dynamical system 
so we to pick inertias spins nominal things that k 
is going to positive 
right 
thats going to give us stability two axes 
first axis is going to marginal 
thats you get 
now, in this case, i different ways to break 
essentially, you one bracketed term times a second bracketed term 
to positive 
so lucas, you say signs bracketed terms 
must true this to stable 
to cancel 
you cancel 
would you mean canceling sines 
this first bracketed term to positive negative 
second bracketed term to 
sure 
right 
we want product two terms to positive 
so must true elements that product 
theyre positive negative 
right 
long theyre sign, we good 
dont jump right to well, this if this to 
positive, this to positive, this to positive 
thats quite true 
thats a condition, condition 
either we positivepositive, is stability, positivenegative, 
sorry, negativenegative, is stability 
you dont want to is positive times negative 
that would definitely an unstable situation 
right 
thats thats essentially, math, thats breaks 
so now, if we inertias 
we nominal spin rate, i want to spin this axis 
two rpm, rpm, whatever youre doing, 
allowable wheel speeds i to guarantee i positive stiffness 
right 
this is boils to 
so we rewrite this different ways this parameter here, k, 
i factor omega e 
that means i divide this wheel speed nominal spacecraft spin rate 
thats whats omega hat 
you see, omega hat is a normalized version wheel speed 
so if this is point one, 
that means wheel is rotating percent spacecraft speed 
if four, youre rotating four times faster spacecraft speed 
thats one way to look it, a convenient way 
we factored inertias brought back together 
this number squared is always going to positive inertias, hopefully positive 
otherwise you imaginary system 
id interested in seeing that 
youre back to bracket times bracket 
theres ratios 
a little bit simpler to look 
again, we need to positive to negative 
lets look one case 
we argued stability looking pole hold plots if we dont a wheel spinning, right 
so if we lock omega hat to zero, weve got nothing one rigid body 
we able to recover results we saw pole hold plots, 
said without energy loss, spins least inertia stable, 
spins max inertia stable weve stayed close spins 
intermediate inertia always unstable 
right 
we see that if we look this 
so if i take omega hat part, you is difference between i i 
i i 
you readily see that if we a spin max inertia, if 
b is a max inertia case, 
this difference to positive 
i is biggest one, so negative 
anything else is going to still zero i minus 
i also to positive, 
i is larger i so positivepositive 
we predicted pole hold plots, getting a stable response 
in a linear sense 
least axis inertia, if i is smallest inertia, 
i minus i will negative, i minus i will negative 
we negativenegative also stable 
thats axis least inertia 
skinny spin 
so linearly, look stable 
we know already energy loss 
pole holds actually gave us much global 
arguments, this is linearized local arguments 
we regained results that we earlier 
again, this is a classic result you able to equations 
so lets look non 
this is condition we if we wheel speed 
so theres always two sets conditions that comes this 
either we pick a wheel speed that this is bigger zero that means 
i to bigger this part, so i bring 
that to righthand side thats you here 
i to bigger this part here, i brought to righthand side 
so you end two inequalities 
to satisfied, right 
if satisfied, you positivepositive 
if instead greater than, if i flip sine say well if this one is less than, 
that makes this negative, this is less than, that makes this negative 
so boundary points 
if you make equal, you two points wheel 
if you look wheel speed spectrum 
zeros in middle, you go left, right, 
you will find two points that critical, 
one bracketed term switches sines 
another point another bracketed term switches sines 
youve identified them, you want to find you 
you between points, you outside points 
is domain that makes stable 
beauty is we this regardless inertias 
so i always actually enforce this condition
