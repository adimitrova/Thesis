1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,480
So here's a example we
want to run through.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,201
Here, I have some principle inertias
that are 350, 300, and 400.

3
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:19,232
Now, just by the numbers, a little
bit unfortunate, the intermediate one

4
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:24,430
if 50 beneath the max and is 50 above
the min, so it's plus and minus 50.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,550
This is why when we look at these wheels,
the critical wheel speeds,

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,429
where things go stable unstable,
it happens to be symmetric.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,100
But, generally these inertias
aren't split evenly like that.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,040
So generally those critical wheel speeds
are not necessarily symmetric, all right.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,250
This example will have them symmetric.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,080
The wheel inertia is ten kilograms,
just to make a lot of math easy.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,620
Spacecraft is to spin about 60 rpm, about
b1, so that's our Omega e1 that you have.

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,100
And so now, we're trying to figure out
how fast do we have to spin this wheel

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,800
at least to guarantee linear
stability of the system.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,580
So you want both bracketed terms
to be either positive or negative.

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,290
Now, those two bracketed terms could
be positive, that's the Set 1.

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,820
That's where we have I1 must be greater
than these other two terms here.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,380
In that case, the left bracket and
the right bracket are both positive, and

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,630
then we have a stable system.

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,987
Set 2, actually just simply reverses this,
greater than becomes a less than.

20
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:29,386
This is the condition that makes the first
and second bracket go negative and

21
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:32,284
that is also a stable configuration,
all right.

22
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:39,440
So now, we want to look at what
is the range of spin rates.

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,675
So the way I like to think of this
is just look at the spin axis.

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,430
We have zero.

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,570
And then, I can go positive spin rate and
negative spin rate.

26
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,520
And we're going to put in inequality
condition to start to go it has to be

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,140
at least to the right of this mark.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,840
And it has to be at least to the left
of this mark, so what's left?

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,900
The union or

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,960
intersections of these different areas,
that's how I solve this stuff at least.

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,530
So if we're looking at this,
in this problem

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,210
if the wheel speed is zero,
is this system going to be stable?

33
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:10,732
Brian.

34
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:16,060
>> They'd take a look at
the inequalities again.

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,140
>> No, no.

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,000
If the wheel speed is zero,
there's no longer a dual spin,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
there's simply a single rigid body.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,327
And we're spinning about b1.

39
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:30,697
About which inertia axis
are we spinning then?

40
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:33,758
>> It's not going to be stable.

41
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:36,141
>> All right, because now we have 350.

42
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:41,020
So b1 is an axis of intermediate inertia
in this particular example, right.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,110
So we know up front, zero cannot
be included in my solution space.

44
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,750
I have to, if this is going to work,

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,850
I have to have something positive or
negative.

46
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,410
And we'll see how that drops out.

47
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,350
So if we do this,
here's the two inequality conditions.

48
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,650
The second one, for
example here, this is one set.

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,710
You can say okay, I2 minus,
you can bring this term over,

50
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,100
that gives you I2 minus I1,
divide by this.

51
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,690
Iw, I2 minus I1,
gives you minus 350 divided by 10.

52
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,960
No, it gets you minus 50 divided by ten,
gives you minus five.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,382
So by bringing this over, omega hat
has to be bigger than minus five.

54
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:29,393
If I'm just going to draw that here,
so let's say,

55
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:35,038
here's the minus five part,
that means, what did I say, less than?

56
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:39,815
All right,
thinking too many steps ahead, okay.

57
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:40,383
No, it's greater than.

58
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:44,895
Okay, so that means we would have to be

59
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:49,300
somewhere greater than minus five.

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,530
But that's only one condition.

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,120
Now the other condition,

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,110
here I'm just going through the math
a little bit more steps, right.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,210
I'm bringing this condition and bringing
this part over to the left hand side.

64
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,250
I1 back over to the right hand side.

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,230
I divide by IW2, here it's I3 minus I1.

66
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,780
You plug in the numbers, which you do
something similar in the homework, so

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,130
I'm just not going to.

68
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,100
You know how to do this algebra.

69
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,877
Then omega hat as to be
greater than plus five.

70
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:18,290
So if we look at this now and say, okay,

71
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,330
there's also a plus five,
and here's the other point.

72
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,230
This is the domain that makes
the second bracket go to B positive.

73
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,437
What is the actual solution space then for
stability?

74
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:40,010
[INAUDIBLE] Great.

75
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,380
So that union between both, right?

76
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,990
because we need both of
them to be positive.

77
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,253
That's going to be here, all right?

78
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,150
Outs greater than.

79
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,394
Is that the only domain, though?

80
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:55,673
Carlo, what do you think?

81
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:57,993
>> Will be less than minus five.

82
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:01,922
>> Less than minus five, now talk me
through why that it's also domain correct.

83
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:06,447
>> Because the second set of equations
doesn't give us that answer.

84
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:10,602
>> Yep, the first set always
has greater than, greater than.

85
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,730
You've identified two points where
each bracketed term flips signs.

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,130
Once you've found those, you've really
found, instead of greater than,

87
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,000
it's all less than.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,550
So instead of always
being to the right of,

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,630
it's always going to
be all to the left of.

90
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,420
And, again, the same unions.

91
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,170
So if you did that to make both brackets
negative, If I pick a different color,

92
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,180
let me make blue for negative right.

93
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,230
Then you would have to be here or here and

94
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,660
the union of that is
just going to be here.

95
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,980
So you can see as expected the origin
is not included in the solution space.

96
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,600
Because as Brian was pointing out,

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,580
this is a single rigid body spinning
about axis remediated inertia.

98
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,110
We know it's not stable, but
if the wheel spins up enough

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,660
then at some point,
you'll notice with this wheel spinning,

100
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,450
you're spinning oars is an oblate body,
you're spinning by axis of max inertia.

101
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,660
That wheel by itself,
the way it's defined.

102
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,820
It's always going to be stable, right?

103
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,960
So if that wheel spins fast enough,
one way to think of this is the stability

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,810
of that wheel is going to overcome
the instability of the spacecraft spin and

105
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,090
that's how we stabilize it.

106
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,290
But you have to get to some minimum
amount where it's just equal and

107
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,280
then you have to be greater than that,
hopefully, quite a bit greater that

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,750
it will increase your stiffness and
your response time as well, right.

109
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,520
So either you can go positive or you can
go negative and that will get you there.

110
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,199
Now, so good.

111
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,181
So in this case, I have, this is one of
the wheel's speed, the critical speeds,

112
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:40,931
you could use or

113
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:44,310
it has to be bigger than that really,
that's what you have to write.

114
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,160
Not equal, but probably bigger than that.

115
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
Or it could also be less
than minus 300 in this case.

116
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,930
There's two sets, both brackets positive,
both brackets negative.

117
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,550
So if I'm giving you some
problem like this though,

118
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,860
here I am saying,
we are spinning about major axis.

119
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
So in this case, b1 is axis of maximum
inertia and without a rotor spin, so

120
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,760
the origin, we would have to be stable,
which is what I am showing.

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,100
If we are spinning up more about
the spacecraft by definition,

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,810
already has a positive spin, about b1.

123
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,980
That is how we derived to all this stuff.

124
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,730
That's how picked b1.

125
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,580
And now,
the wheel is also spinning about that.

126
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,233
If the spacecraft is max inertia stable,
the wheel is max inertia stable and

127
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:33,780
they're both spinning about positive b1,
it's always just going to be stable.

128
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,240
More and more stable.

129
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,320
If you start to spin it
the opposite direction though,

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,360
even though the space craft by itself
without that wheel will stable,

131
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,870
it has the speed momentum
that helps stabilize it.

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,756
What happens with the wheel,
if it's in the opposite direction,

133
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:57,018
it's going to start to pull out the total
momentum gets reduced, actually.

134
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,044
If this is spinning at 10 RPM positive and

135
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:05,040
the wheel is 100 RPM negative,
you're pulling out momentum.

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,840
And in fact, the momentum perspective,
at some point it acts like the separatrix,

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,870
it acts like the unstable
intermediate axis motion and

138
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,719
you will drive a system unstable.

139
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,090
But the good news is no matter what axis,
principle axis,

140
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,385
you want to spin nominally, we can always
find a wheel speed that will stabilize it.

141
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:26,970
[LAUGH] The bad news is no matter how
stable the spacecraft was before you

142
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,009
touched it, once you touch it, you have
the capability to drive it unstable.

143
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,800
So make sure you have the right
real speeds otherwise

144
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,540
your sponsor will not be happy.

145
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,999
At some point again,
if you go fast enough,

146
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:42,864
then the wheel momentum will dominate and
it's very, very stable.

147
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:47,220
Whatever the spacecraft's
doing is almost noise.

148
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,440
So with all duo spinners to extremes
infinity real speeds always stable.

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,800
But in between, there is a region,
a finite zone, that is unstable.

150
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,840
So for an intermediate axis speed,
which we looked at.

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,210
And in our problem, we had plus and

152
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,500
minus five, that was just because of the
inertias, it doesn't have to be symmetric.

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,770
If you see something like this
that excludes the origin,

154
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,190
right away I could say,

155
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,960
this must be spinning about an axis of
intermediate inertia with a dual-spinner.

156
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,940
Just from the solution space.

157
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,342
And, if you have an axis
of a least inertia,

158
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:20,605
you're spinning about this region that you
shouldn't be spinning about is actually in

159
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,955
the positive spin direction and just
all comes out of the mathematics then.

160
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:24,600
Jordan.
>> Sorry,

161
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,053
I missed how can it be stable if you're
spinning it less than negative five.

162
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:33,215
>> Both bracketed terms.

163
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:36,975
because the two brackets have
to either be positive, and

164
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:41,150
that was the argument for
the black hash lines.

165
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,710
But we found the two critical points.

166
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,530
If we also less than
those critical points,

167
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,309
then both brackets both become negative.

168
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,440
>> Okay.

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,910
>> And that's why this is also a possible
answer, out of the mathematics.

170
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,530
>> Thanks.
>> Yeah, good.

171
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,590
So anyway, but
this gives you now a quick solution space.

172
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,440
You can do these easy homework with
this yourself, to come up with it.

173
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,529
But just remember the extremums
are always included.

174
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,400
The origin is only included for
a max and min inertia case and

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,410
then you kind of look at the pattern.

176
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,863
If I see the pattern, I know right
away what type of spin we're doing.
