1
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,310
Now, let's look at this.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,260
What we're going to start to do now is,
talk about stability.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,860
And as soon as we talk about stability,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,800
we always talk about small
departures all right?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,170
This is an equilibrium and
this is an equilibrium.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,790
Equilibrium has nothing
to do with stability.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,310
Equilibrium just means,
if I put it particular side of state.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,020
Theta is equal to 180 degrees, if I am
measuring this is zero, this would be 180.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,820
What happens if I have small
motions than stability?.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,940
Equilibrium just means,

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,190
if you this at this particular state,
your state rates will go to 0.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,240
X go to 0.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,930
And as we did with the spin stability
of a single rigid body, we're going to

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,020
look at for what conditions now will this
vanish, if I did n't have any of this.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,090
If I only have this, You can see, for

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,560
what conditions will omega 1,
2, and 3 dot go to zero?

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
One case is of course trivial,
as you make all your rates 0.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,810
That not exactly a spinning condition,
it's going to have a trivial solution.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,534
If you have something else though,
the only way you can make with general

20
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:19,188
inertias, the only way you can make
all of three terms go to zero Is how?

21
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:22,360
Andre?

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,290
>> By axisymmetric.

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,140
>> It doesn't have to be axis,
we can look at axisymmetric.

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,890
If it's axisymmetric about one of
the axis, this could go to 0 which says,

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,020
omega 1 is constant, right.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,080
And then, you have to make these two
go to 0 if omega 1 is a non 0 value.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,630
The only way these can vanish, these
are not the same inertias cause it's not

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,210
the spherical symmetry, is omega 3 and
omega 2 would have to be zero, right?

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,370
That's one way, yes.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,480
But for general inertias, if the inertia
differences are never zero, how'd you make

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,560
all three of them go to zero without
having all three omegas go to zero.

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,190
Just to big omega and [INAUDIBLE].

33
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,370
>> Well,
we don't have big omega right now.

34
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,050
Let's ignore the real.

35
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,480
If you just have single rigid body.

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,300
Spencer.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,370
>> Would you spin it about
the axis of maximum inertia and

38
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,150
then, have 0 spinning
about the other two axes?

39
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,660
>> You could.
In fact,

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,210
you could spin it about
any of the principal axes.

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,220
because if omega 1 is nonzero, let's say
omega 1 was axis of maximum inertia.

42
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,080
Then omega 1 is nonzero, this is nonzero.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
But Omega 2s and 3s is 0.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,870
I got 0 times 0, something finite times 0,

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,875
which is also 0 0 again something times 0,
0 right it all vanishes.

46
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,645
This is where we identify quickly from
the mathematics now the three equilibrium

47
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:42,840
spins for general inertia is
appears spin about to b1, b2 or b3.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,640
Which also what we saw graphically
in the pole hole plots.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,490
And we discussed several different ways,
right?

50
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,670
Those are the three spin equilibrius.

51
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,250
But in real life, we don't spin
spacecraft around intermediate axis or

52
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,840
leased axis because we have to worry about
any anticipation and chaotic behavior.

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
So, it really limits your design to
just spin about axis of max inertia.

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,180
Geostationary satellites tend to be tall,
those Boeing 501s I believe were these big

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,640
tubular shapes and they want to spin so
they're always pointing at the earth.

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,860
So, they want to spin about
the least axis of inertia

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,300
which we know is an issue with energy
loss, and always be pointing at the earth.

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,980
And so, this dual spinner allows us
to spin actually about any axis.

59
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,650
I could even spin with the dual spin
about axis of intermediate inertia.

60
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,822
And with the right spin conditions which
we'll develop I can make it stable.

61
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:34,250
So this is a way to provide passive
stability without the dual spinner,

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,430
you could only long term spin
about axis of max inertia.

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,490
With the wheel once we add this stuff.

64
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,730
We look at the mathematics now.

65
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,480
I can show you that we
have other equilibrias.

66
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,150
And conditions where if we
pick the right wheel speeds,

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,710
I can make any one of them
stable without feedback.

68
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,040
So rigid body,
we have to spin about B1, 2, and 3.

69
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,730
Those are the equilibrias.

70
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,220
Now, let's do the same
exercise with a wheel.

71
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,090
And we're going to say this
wheel with a dual spinner,

72
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,050
your nominal case is the wheel
is moving at a constant rate.

73
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,480
That means omega dot vanishes.

74
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,100
Now, I want to find an equilibrium,
where is omega 1 dot, 2 dot, and 3 dot 0?

75
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,890
And I'm going to have Non 0 omega 1,
2s, or 3s.

76
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,880
I don't want everything to be stationary.

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,680
That's back to the trivial answer,
but I also want to have a non 0 omega.

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,708
How can we make that work?

79
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:35,001
>> [COUGH]
>> All right,

80
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,110
because you kind of basically
go through deductions.

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,030
Like Sherlock Holmes,
you deduct what can't be possible.

82
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,370
Whatever is left, however improbably,
must be the answer, right?

83
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,880
So if we start out here, this is already
zero because it's a constant wheel speed.

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,500
The only way to make this zero, and again,
we're looking at general inertia still,

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,410
in this case, is either to omega 2 or
3 has to be zero.

86
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,680
Okay, let's pick omega 2.

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Right?

88
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Start the deduction.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,820
If omega 2 is zero,
this is going to be 0 and

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,230
this is a finite wheel speed
times 0 it's all going to be 0.

91
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,680
And you go hey, I like this.

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,750
Okay?

93
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,090
But now, omega 3.

94
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,474
If this is going to go to 0,
you could make omega 1, 0.

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,990
But if we don't want all
three of them to be 0.

96
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,410
If you make omega 1 0,
omega 3 has to be 0.

97
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,270
This term goes to 0.

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,010
Omega 1 being 0 times something.

99
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,320
If omega 3 is not 0,
then you have nonzero times nonzero.

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,600
You don't get a 0 second
derivative of the omegas.

101
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,580
A zero derivative over the second Omega.

102
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,180
So, that wouldn't work.

103
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,510
So, instead what you can see
is you make Omega two zero.

104
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,050
That vanishes, cancels this,
makes this all zero.

105
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,560
The only way you can make this one zero
is to take Omega three that's zero.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,890
Then even if Omega one is non zero.

107
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,130
It doesn't matter.

108
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,150
And the wheel can be non-zero,
and it doesn't matter.

109
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,200
They're both multiplied
times something zero.

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,790
So, that's going to be the equilibrium.

111
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,520
You notice the first axis is also, so
I can have an omega one that's non-zero.

112
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,400
But that one axis is also the axis
that's a spin axis of the wheel.

113
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,390
That's where this came from.

114
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,280
About any other axis,

115
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,250
you can't really make this work
I could have picked omega three,

116
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,630
went through the same logic, you end up
with the same answer with this stuff.

117
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,620
So, instead of being able to have spin
equlibrias about any of the principle axes

118
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,340
of the space craft with a dual spinner,
you're now too constrained to

119
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,399
only have an equilibria about
the spin axis of the wheel.

120
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,010
If I have a tumble about omega 2 and
not omega 1 and 3 I end up here

121
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,560
with cross coupling terms that will give
me non 0 derivatives right that wouldn't

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,910
be an equilibrium spin it would be more
of a general tumble that you would have.

123
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,180
So, yes Ansel?

124
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,120
>> You were talking about how this was
passive but you would need some kind of.

125
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,940
Big or bigger right.

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,030
If you have to actually carry this out.

127
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,840
>> You would spin it up.

128
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,320
And we'll get to the spin up part in a few
slides, probably on Tuesday next week.

129
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,530
But here it's just once we've
axed the spin condition.

130
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,810
And then, you just have a little motor
that keeps it spinning at a fixed rate.

131
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,830
There's no external feedback that says
look at the stars, look at the horizon,

132
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,150
look at everything and stabilize me.

133
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,470
It's just holding it at a fixed speed.

134
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,210
That's it.

135
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,790
>> Big omegadot as zero.

136
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,530
>> Yes, so the dual spinner,
the nominal case is big omega dot to zero.
