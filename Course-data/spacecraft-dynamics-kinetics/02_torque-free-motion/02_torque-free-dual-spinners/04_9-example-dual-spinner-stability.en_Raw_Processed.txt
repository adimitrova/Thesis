so heres a example we 
want to run 
here, i principle inertias 
that , , 
now, numbers, a little 
bit unfortunate, intermediate one 
if beneath max is 
min, so plus minus 
this is we look wheels, 
critical wheel speeds, 
things go stable unstable, 
happens to symmetric 
but, generally inertias 
arent split evenly like that 
so generally critical wheel speeds 
necessarily symmetric, right 
this example will symmetric 
wheel inertia is ten kilograms, 
to make a lot math easy 
spacecraft is to spin rpm, 
b, so thats omega e that you 
so now, trying to figure 
fast we to spin this wheel 
least to guarantee linear 
stability system 
so you want bracketed terms 
to either positive negative 
now, two bracketed terms could 
positive, thats set 
thats we i must greater 
two terms here 
in that case, left bracket 
right bracket positive, 
we a stable system 
set , actually simply reverses this, 
greater becomes a less 
this is condition that makes first 
second bracket go negative 
that is also a stable configuration, 
right 
so now, we want to look 
is range spin rates 
so way i like to think this 
is look spin axis 
we zero 
then, i go positive spin rate 
negative spin rate 
going to put in inequality 
condition to start to go to 
least to right this mark 
to least to left 
this mark, so whats left 
union 
intersections different areas, 
thats i solve this stuff least 
so if looking this, 
in this problem 
if wheel speed is zero, 
is this system going to stable 
brian 
theyd take a look 
inequalities 
no, 
if wheel speed is zero, 
theres longer a dual spin, 
theres simply a single rigid body 
spinning b 
inertia axis 
we spinning 
going to stable 
right, we 
so b is an axis intermediate inertia 
in this particular example, right 
so we know front, zero cannot 
included in solution space 
i to, if this is going to work, 
i to something positive 
negative 
well see that drops 
so if we this, 
heres two inequality conditions 
second one, 
example here, this is one set 
you say okay, i minus, 
you bring this term over, 
that gives you i minus i, 
divide this 
iw, i minus i, 
gives you minus divided 
no, gets you minus divided ten, 
gives you minus five 
so bringing this over, omega hat 
to bigger minus five 
if im going to draw that here, 
so lets say, 
heres minus five part, 
that means, i say, less 
right, 
thinking many steps ahead, okay 
no, greater 
okay, so that means we would to 
somewhere greater minus five 
thats one condition 
condition, 
here im going math 
a little bit steps, right 
im bringing this condition bringing 
this part to left hand side 
i back to right hand side 
i divide iw, here i minus i 
you plug in numbers, you 
something similar in homework, so 
im going to 
you know to this algebra 
omega hat to 
greater plus five 
so if we look this say, okay, 
theres also a plus five, 
heres point 
this is domain that makes 
second bracket go to b positive 
is actual solution space 
stability 
inaudible great 
so that union between both, right 
we need 
to positive 
thats going to here, right 
outs greater 
is that domain, though 
carlo, you think 
will less minus five 
less minus five, talk 
that also domain correct 
second set equations 
doesnt give us that answer 
yep, first set always 
greater than, greater 
youve identified two points 
bracketed term flips signs 
youve found those, youve really 
found, instead greater than, 
less 
so instead always 
to right of, 
always going to 
to left 
and, again, unions 
so if you that to make brackets 
negative, if i pick a different color, 
let make blue negative right 
you would to here here 
union that is 
going to here 
so you see expected origin 
is included in solution space 
brian pointing out, 
this is a single rigid body spinning 
axis remediated inertia 
we know stable, 
if wheel spins enough 
point, 
youll notice this wheel spinning, 
youre spinning oars is an oblate body, 
youre spinning axis max inertia 
that wheel itself, 
way defined 
always going to stable, right 
so if that wheel spins fast enough, 
one way to think this is stability 
that wheel is going to overcome 
instability spacecraft spin 
thats we stabilize 
you to get to minimum 
amount equal 
you to greater that, 
hopefully, quite a bit greater that 
will increase stiffness 
response time well, right 
so either you go positive you 
go negative that will get you there 
now, so good 
so in this case, i have, this is one 
wheels speed, critical speeds, 
you could use 
to bigger that really, 
thats you to write 
equal, probably bigger that 
could also less 
minus in this case 
theres two sets, brackets positive, 
brackets negative 
so if im giving you 
problem like this though, 
here i saying, 
we spinning major axis 
so in this case, b is axis maximum 
inertia without a rotor spin, so 
origin, we would to stable, 
is i showing 
if we spinning 
spacecraft definition, 
already a positive spin, b 
that is we derived to this stuff 
thats picked b 
now, 
wheel is also spinning that 
if spacecraft is max inertia stable, 
wheel is max inertia stable 
theyre spinning positive b, 
always going to stable 
stable 
if you start to spin 
opposite direction though, 
even though space craft 
without that wheel will stable, 
speed momentum 
that helps stabilize 
happens wheel, 
if in opposite direction, 
going to start to pull total 
momentum gets reduced, actually 
if this is spinning rpm positive 
wheel is rpm negative, 
youre pulling momentum 
in fact, momentum perspective, 
point acts like separatrix, 
acts like unstable 
intermediate axis motion 
you will drive a system unstable 
good news is matter axis, 
principle axis, 
you want to spin nominally, we always 
find a wheel speed that will stabilize 
laugh bad news is matter 
stable spacecraft you 
touched it, you touch it, you 
capability to drive unstable 
so make sure you right 
real speeds otherwise 
sponsor will happy 
point again, 
if you go fast enough, 
wheel momentum will dominate 
very, stable 
whatever spacecrafts 
is almost noise 
so duo spinners to extremes 
infinity real speeds always stable 
in between, there is a region, 
a finite zone, that is unstable 
so an intermediate axis speed, 
we looked 
in problem, we plus 
minus five, that 
inertias, doesnt to symmetric 
if you see something like this 
that excludes origin, 
right away i could say, 
this must spinning an axis 
intermediate inertia a dualspinner 
solution space 
and, if you an axis 
a least inertia, 
youre spinning this region that you 
shouldnt spinning is actually in 
positive spin direction 
comes mathematics 
jordan 
sorry, 
i missed stable if youre 
spinning less negative five 
bracketed terms 
two brackets 
to either positive, 
that argument 
black hash lines 
we found two critical points 
if we also less 
critical points, 
brackets become negative 
okay 
thats this is also a possible 
answer, mathematics 
thanks 
yeah, good 
so anyway, 
this gives you a quick solution space 
you easy homework 
this yourself, to come 
remember extremums 
always included 
origin is included 
a max min inertia case 
you kind look pattern 
if i see pattern, i know right 
away type spin
