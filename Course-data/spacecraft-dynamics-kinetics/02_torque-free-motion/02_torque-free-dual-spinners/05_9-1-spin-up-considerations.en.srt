1
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:10,950
Okay now we were looking at
an old nominal big omega.zero.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,560
The wheel's not accelerating.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,860
We don't launch that way.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,620
We launch with everything locked down and
then we release it.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,480
And in fact, the craft will have
some spin after it gets kicked off.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,237
And then we engaged its wheel and
momentum happens and

7
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,939
how does it settle in the end
as you're spinning up?

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,020
There are some classic
answers we can go through.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,657
So To begin with, what's commonly
done with these dual spinners,

10
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:39,500
they're released where it's spinning about
an axis that's not aligned with the wheel.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,450
Wheel was aligned with b1, so
the spacecraft, let's assume it's spinning

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,930
about b2 or b3 or some combination
thereof, something orthogonal to b1.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,850
So we want it to be doing this in the end,
spinning skinny, but

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,560
right now it's just doing
this kind of a tumble.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,720
And then the reaction wheel is spun up.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,430
If this is spinning, and
it has inertia of one, and

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,600
a spin rate of one, then inertia times
spin rate gives momentum of one.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,870
Just non dimensional units.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,188
I'm going to spin up my wheel until
its momentum magnitude matches that

20
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:18,160
of the space craft after launch
which is one in this case, right?

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,708
Now, in this kind of a dynamical system is
Is the angular momentum vector conserved?

22
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:27,860
Tony.

23
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,170
>> No, because there's a torque
being applied to spin up.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,050
>> Right.
There's a torque.

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,079
But the torque is applied
between which two bodies?

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,250
>> The wheel and the spacecraft.

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,390
>> Okay so for the system I'm talking
about wheel and spacecraft system.

28
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,860
>> Okay.
>> Is that an internal torque or

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,830
an external torque?

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,960
>> It would be an internal.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,850
>> Exactly.
So there is still no external torque.

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,970
So for the combined hub and wheel system,
the total momentum vector which

33
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,630
is what we [LAUGH] used to derive the
equations of motion like h dot equal to L.

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,970
That h still has to be fixed
as seen by inertial observer.

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,750
So we can use that.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,380
So then we want to really study what
happens to the attitude as we do this

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,240
spin up, right?

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,404
And we're going to go through this.

39
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:17,600
So the initial spin rate, we said,
we're tumbling here, right?

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,510
About b2, just without loss of generality,
I'm tumbling at a rate 1,

41
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,680
inertia 1, gives me momentum 1,
that's what I have here.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,740
And spinning up the momentum of
the wheel relative to the body,

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,660
that was the wheel
inertia times big omega.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,410
Big omega was omega of
wheel relative to b, right?

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm simply having omega dots, that tells
me how little h is changing with time.

46
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,650
And we're just going to
constantly increase it right now.

47
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,140
We're not doing any input shaping or
something like that,

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,860
just going to ramp it up linearly
until you hit the desired speed.

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:54,130
And the desired speed will make little h
be equal to big H, that's what we said.

50
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,770
So the momentum of the wheel relative to
the craft is same as the total momentum

51
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,440
of the system.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,500
So the manuever time
you can figure it out.

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,070
Well at the end I have to have this much.

54
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,450
That's my constant rate.

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,420
You can quickly compute.

56
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,260
This is going to take a hundred seconds,
a thousand seconds depending on

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,910
how quickly you're ramping
up your wheel speed.

58
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,320
Right?
This is how long it will take to

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,540
reach this total amount of momentum.

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,950
So we can compute that.

61
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,994
Nominally we had launching like this,
we're spinning right and

62
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:25,702
then this wheel is going to be spinning
up until its momentum magnitude matches

63
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:29,987
this spacecraft momentum at the time T0,
and this is going to line up.

64
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:32,824
Or is it?

65
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:42,120
We argued total H vector
has to be constant, right?

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,770
We cannot change the total
momentum of this two body system

67
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,910
with internal torques as Tony was saying.

68
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,420
So h is always the same,
it's always pointing up in this drawing.

69
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,050
If the wheel momentum is the same as
the spacecraft initial momentum, and

70
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,850
the wheel is spinning about this axis.

71
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,320
Since the total momentum is
the momentum of the spacecraft plus

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,060
the momentum of the wheel, doesn't
that mean the spacecraft is despun,

73
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,880
like what Nathan was talking about?

74
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,080
And it must be lined up this way.

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,760
Now, the way I'm asking that question,
obviously the answer is no, right?

76
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,067
The trick is why?

77
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,253
Why?

78
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:29,934
What are the other attitudes that allow
you to have little h be equal to big H,

79
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,070
but I'm not lining up perfectly.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,988
Onzo, what do you think?

81
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:39,980
>> I can't think of anything
off the top of my head.

82
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,764
>> Any ideas?

83
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:47,910
Think of this.

84
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,590
Right now we've been
talking about magnitudes.

85
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,910
What we have to add up really is vectors,

86
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,940
the ang momentum vector of the body plus
the ang momentum vector of the wheels.

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,420
Yes?

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,630
>> Depending on the direction that you.

89
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,810
>> Well no, we are spinning up
>> Okay, so you are assuming

90
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,372
>> It's locked in, and we're there, right.

91
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:13,000
But it is dependent on
the direction of these vectors.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,650
Just because little h is equal to
the magnitude of the initial big H

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,160
doesn't mean the two directions
have to be the same.

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,040
And that's essentially, this is our
initial h that we have, this system.

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,900
This is how we launched, wheels were
locked down, then we're speeding it up.

96
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,950
And, at the ends the wheel has a vector

97
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,700
magnitude that is the same as
the initial magnitude of the system.

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Little h was equal to big H,
those are the scalars.

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,900
But you could have two vectors
that have the same magnitude but

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,050
not be in the same direction.

101
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,250
And then this is actually what
the spacecraft body must be doing.

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,770
So this momentum vector plus this one
add up to be the same as the original.

103
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,709
We argue we cannot
change initial momentum.

104
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,330
So, by doing this maneuver,
we're not guaranteed, we, typically,

105
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,130
when spacecraft launched this way,
they want it to line up like this.

106
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,310
We talked about the Boeing 501s.

107
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,090
They have geostats that always point
at the earth, skinny ones like this.

108
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,980
You want them to be nice and even.

109
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,370
They're not doing this big wobble.

110
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,590
They call this coning motion.

111
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,130
This is your coning angle
that you can see right here.

112
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,790
So we'd like it to be zero, but
it's not typically zero when it happens.

113
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,820
And there's different ways to explain what
is happening, but basically this momentum

114
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,629
matching guarantee doesn't enforce that
those two things actually line up.

115
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,740
Now the analysis of this
gets rather complicated.

116
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,460
Typically we have to,

117
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,730
now I will show you some numerical
results to kind of talk about this.

118
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,100
We don't have nice analytic answers
to guarantee these behaviors, but

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,140
we can study this stuff.

120
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,090
I mean there's lots of theories
behind this but I'm giving it a spin.

121
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,150
Initially with Tom Blake you're not omega
2 but omega 3 for 30 degrees per second.

122
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,250
Have wheel inertia, spacecraft stuff,
everything's locked down.

123
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,060
This gives me an initial big H, momentum.

124
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,640
And now I'm going to go ahead and start
spinning up that wheel at a constant rate.

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,140
So I just took the equations of motion
you saw earlier, last class, and

126
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm integrating them with these initial
conditions and also tracking the attitude.

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm not just tracking omega but I used
Euler angles and, I forget what I used,

128
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,760
something, maybe MRPs.

129
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,850
And at two hundred seconds,
I have finished that maneuver.

130
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,580
And you saw then at two hundred seconds,
we were close to being lined up like this.

131
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,500
But there was still a little bit of
a wobble left, that happens there.

132
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,010
And so

133
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,500
that amount of wobble, that's what's
happening with these amplitudes here.

134
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,030
We can predict that now and
see what's happening.

135
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,100
So we get close but not quite there.

136
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,600
Here I'm taking a thousand seconds,
because I'm taking a lot more time.

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,095
So it'll take about a minute to run and

138
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:51,360
you can see all these simulations running
and it keeps wobbling and spinning.

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,230
But it's a much more gradual process.

140
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,670
So what's going to happen now
in this process is It'll take,

141
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,250
obviously takes more time to roll up,
but if you look at the final omega two's

142
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,480
before it was like plus minus seven
degrees and even these axis were bigger,

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,030
we will have less of a coning
angle at the end of this maneuver.

144
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,170
So when It gets close there we'll
want to take a look at that.

145
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,080
And that's the general trends
we have in these systems.

146
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,390
With a dual spinner we're just spinning
it up, we don't want to be too aggressive

147
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,590
because you end up with this huge
momentum vector off to the side.

148
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,090
You really have,
then you have to do other stuff.

149
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,600
You want to have a coning
angle as small as possible so

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,770
a little patience goes a long way.

151
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,570
Take a little bit longer
to spin this thing up and

152
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,340
at that point,
you have a smaller coning angle.

153
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,100
So it will get there.

154
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,880
We're about halfway there.

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,700
The way we get rid of this coning angle,
you could use thrusters,

156
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,420
in the end if you want
to change the attitude.

157
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,092
You could apply h dot equal to l, apply
some thrusters, in the right control.

158
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,460
And change that momentum vector of
the body, and puff it back into place.

159
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,270
But now we're using fuel,
we hate using fuel in space.

160
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,930
There's an elegant method that people have
devised which called the mutation damper.

161
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,950
Anybody heard of a mutation damper before?

162
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,660
No?

163
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,640
What it does is you put basically
a ball in a tube of slush,

164
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
oil, something highly viscous.

165
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,150
So it creates friction.

166
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,740
So we're losing energy.

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,350
All right?

168
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,410
And what we want to have is spin
about omega one in the end and so

169
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,720
you make that damper, you line up that
tube of slush along either b2 or 3.

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,310
So if you're still wobbling
with the conic motion,

171
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,260
you're always actually exciting that
slosh, and you're losing energy.

172
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,270
And then people have shown this stuff,

173
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,220
at the end it would actually get rid
of the coning motion completely.

174
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
And that goes there.

175
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,460
We've used this as a 50 turn project in
the past where people have to integrate

176
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,220
this and study the spin up and
go through that.

177
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,600
It's a fun project actually.

178
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,060
So take away notes is spin up,

179
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,320
just because you match momentum magnitudes
doesn't mean you've matched the vectors.

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,400
Teaching those vectors and
patience goes a long way.

181
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,700
To get rid of the coning angle, you want
to put a mutation damper orthogonal.

182
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,120
That'll get rid of the energies of
these modes here over time, and

183
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,090
it'll settle in place.

184
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,000
And there's all kinds of,
you can look up mutation dampers.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
But here's the results.

186
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,866
So with two hundred seconds
you see where you are.

187
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,947
A thousand seconds,
you know, five times longer,

188
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,471
we've improved it by a factor of two.

189
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,630
There's really, it's an asintotic thing.

190
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,130
So if you want to get even closer,
you might take a long time.

191
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,940
That's where,
how patient are you, you know.

192
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,219
A little bit of mutation
damping can go a long way, and

193
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,493
get rid of the coning motion.

194
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:27,390
Other things are, we've seen plots.

195
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,510
I'm just going to go through this,
reasonably high-level.

196
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,330
But just to show you, plots have also been
applied not just for rigid bodies, but

197
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,950
also systems of rigid bodies like
these wheels and dual spinners.

198
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,270
The energy here, this is really
the energy of the spacecraft only,

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,390
here, not the real energy
relative to the spacecraft.

200
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,400
So not the part with i w over two,
big omega squared.

201
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,830
So that's called E star.

202
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,740
The total momentum energy of the system
is as before, the momentum sphere just

203
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,530
has to be constant, even with internal
torques acting because they're internal.

204
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,190
They're not changing the total
momentum of the system.

205
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,430
Which is kind of nice,
that's a constraint.

206
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,100
So we can rewrite the energy
ellipsoid of the spacecraft

207
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,030
in terms of these coordinates.

208
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,840
And with a little math this is how you,
this is what you come up with.

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,760
So because the energy that you have,
the momentum about the one axis is due to

210
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,290
the wheel and due to the spacecraft, so
you have to pull out the wheel momentum.

211
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,050
And then divide by the right stuff
to come up with the energy terms

212
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,260
of the spacecraft about the one axis.

213
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,970
The two and three axis look like before.

214
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,700
But this is a sphere, this is still an
ellipsoid, but it's a shifted ellipsoid.

215
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,810
If your h one two threes are essentially
your X, Y, Z, independent coordinates.

216
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,098
If you go look up the classic
ellipsoidal equation.

217
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:48,460
If you didn't have minus h this would be
a centered ellipsoid that's there, and

218
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,090
with the minus h, it actually shifts
that ellipsoid along the one access.

219
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,560
So as we spin up the wheel that
energy ellipsoid is going to move.

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,200
And that's what you see here.

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,560
Initially we launched
the spacecraft spin is here.

222
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,700
We were spinning purely about b3 in
that numerical problem I showed you.

223
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,120
Then as we spin up the wheel

224
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,330
you can see these are the momentum
coordinates that we have to satisfy.

225
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,040
That's the total momentum
coordinates of the spacecraft.

226
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,930
It intersects energy in here.

227
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:23,620
And the energy ellipsoid starts to shrink
inside and of the spacecraft cause as

228
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,330
we spin up the wheel the spacecraft tends
to de-spin and change it's orientation.

229
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,780
Although momentum we'd like
it to go into the wheels.

230
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,850
So there's different critical points.

231
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,930
At one point this ellypsoid intercepts
in this nice figure eight motion.

232
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,940
This kind of a separate trick stuff
that we've seen with rigid bodies.

233
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,610
And then when the momentum magnitude
matches, this is what you end up with.

234
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,860
Just because you match momentum magnitudes
doesn't guarantee that you've despun

235
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,400
the primary body completely.

236
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,120
And this is where a mutation damper would
help get rid of that remaining energy and

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,350
make that actually attractive and
collapse onto a point.

238
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,100
And that's what would be happening there.

239
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,820
So I'm just kind of showing
this more as a pictorial thing.

240
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,690
So you've seen this.

241
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,891
It's not something that'll be on the exam.

242
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:09,899
But these plots, these graphical
visualizations of momentum and

243
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,430
energy are quite powerful.

244
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,825
And if you read a lot of
classical attitude control,

245
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,721
you will see these kind of tools
being used in different areas.
