1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,289
So these are the equilibrias we're trying to identify.

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:13,554
When are - if I have equilibrium states, it's like with the pendulum, right?

3
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:17,230
Theta zero was an equilibrium, 180 was an equilibrium.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,099
And then you can look at 180 plus deltas, right, to look at small departures.

5
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,995
With the omegas, I'm saying I have some omegas

6
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:27,010
equilibrium spin, and then I can look at small departures.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,170
What if I'm wobbling slightly off axis?

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,340
Do things stay close or does things go crazy?

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,115
Right, that would be unstable.

10
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:38,625
So if you look at equilibrium conditions, we'd make the big omega dot equal to zero.

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,145
I've basically rewritten it, but instead of just having omega

12
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:45,727
one, two, threes, it's omega E1, 2 and 3s to highlight these equilibrium conditions.

13
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:52,435
And what came out of this was that we had to have this condition, essentially.

14
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:57,250
The spacecraft has to be spinning about the same axis as the wheel.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,060
The other two have to be zero.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,039
Then all my omega E1, 2s, and 3 dots become zero.

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,260
That's an equilibrium.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,105
So now we're going to look at small departures.

19
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:08,734
So we're using linear stability analysis.

20
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:12,099
It is - if you haven't done too much of this, this is nothing but a basically spring mass

21
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,844
damper-like system in the end.

22
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:14,290
Right?

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,954
Once we linearize about this motion, you end up with something plus

24
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:23,805
cx dot plus kx, and then from then we can argue stability.

25
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:27,670
So the angular accelerations, if you put dots on everything, you would just have

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,775
your nominal spins plus the departures.

27
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:34,209
And we know, for our equilibriums, the nominal spins about two

28
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,174
and three are actually going to be zero.

29
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:40,689
This one could be none, or at the equilibrium, it has to be zero.

30
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,665
Omega E2 is going to be zero.

31
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:43,829
E3 is going to be zero.

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,114
This one is going to be a non-zero value.

33
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,609
This is going to be a non-zero.

34
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,965
So you just plug in the terms and one - there's different ways you can linearize.

35
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,495
Later on, we'll do Taylor series expansions and come up with first order terms.

36
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,269
Here, I'm just plugging it in.

37
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:59,560
I see delta times delta, that's second order, I drop it.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,170
If you have omega E1, that's some number

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,394
times a delta; well, that's still first order, I keep it.

40
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,790
First order times zero; well, that's definitely zero, right?

41
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,310
And you drop it.

42
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,906
But that's basically what you do when you run through these.

43
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:16,210
These equilibrias are both zero and only have first order terms.

44
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,189
So you can run.

45
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,705
And in your homeworks, you've also do some linearizations.

46
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,590
If you now drop all the second order or the zero terms,

47
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,879
this is what you end up with a dual spinner.

48
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,450
So right away, this looks a little bit like the axisymmetric case we covered,

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,784
where we had two inertias being equal and whatever was the axis of symmetry,

50
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:39,340
the spin rate about that axis ended up being

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,219
constant, while the other ones you could wobble

52
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,094
and we had sines and cosine answers.

53
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:46,715
Here, in this mathematics, we have our departure.

54
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,280
This is not my nominal spin rate.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,180
This is my delta omega one.

56
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,090
So if I'm supposed to be spinning at one degree per second,

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,219
but somebody kicked it off with one point one degree per second,

58
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,215
right, then you're delta omega one is point one degree per second.

59
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:04,125
This tells me how does that point one degree per second change with time.

60
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,009
And it turns out, it doesn't.

61
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,750
So if you're spinning off a dual spinner

62
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,560
and you inject it into that orbit

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,175
and instead of doing 360 degrees per day, if it's doing 360.1 degrees per day,

64
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,080
well, it will just keep doing that.

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
So we call this kind of a marginal stability.

66
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,849
It doesn't grow, it doesn't shrink.

67
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:23,770
It doesn't do anything.

68
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,150
It's just flat lines there.

69
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,449
It's not - so it doesn't recover itself if it's off.

70
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,639
It doesn't get closer again at some point like that.

71
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,849
So if you - if you weren't happy with that behavior,

72
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,060
you probably would need some active control to nudge it

73
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,740
and get it within your tolerances.

74
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,650
I have to have a drift rate that's less than one thousandth of a degree

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,270
per day or something, you know, to always be pointing at the Earth.

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,414
So - so dual spinner doesn't give you any passive stabilizing component.

77
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,730
It doesn't make it go unstable, it just -

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,435
whatever air you have, that's what you stick with.

79
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,050
That's one way to look at this.

80
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,280
Now the other two, again, omega E1, that's our nominal spin rate.

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,439
360 per day, that's one rev per day like a geo satellite would have to do.

82
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,009
These are the departure motions

83
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,100
and you can see that my departure spin rate

84
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,539
about the second axis is a function only of delta omega three.

85
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,975
So delta omega two dot depends on delta omega three

86
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:20,199
and delta omega three dot depends on delta omega two.

87
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,045
The wheel speeds are just constants that we hold here.

88
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:27,035
So we have two coupled first order differential equations.

89
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,274
Matt, do you remember our trick we had earlier?

90
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,790
How to solve two coupled first order differential equations?

91
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,790
You take the derivative from it?

92
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,569
Exactly.

93
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,175
We want to get rid of the derivatives to find

94
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,470
- or find an answer to this, and it turns out

95
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,629
it's often easier to first differentiate again.

96
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,502
And that's what we're gonna do.

97
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:46,649
Because if I take the derivative of this, all of this is nothing but constant.

98
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,519
My nominal speed is a fixed value.

99
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,969
It's supposed to be doing 360 per day, right?

100
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,574
This is a fixed wheel speed; inertias are fixed.

101
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,959
So everything is a constant.

102
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,389
So I only have delta omega three dot.

103
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,910
Then, when I take this derivative, I can plug in this equation

104
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,670
and get one second order differential equation.

105
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:09,209
Very similar to what we did mathematically with that single spacecraft axisymmetric case.

106
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,300
So if I do this, I took its derivative, all this is constant,

107
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,860
you get this, plug in the other equation, you end up with this one.

108
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,949
Now this should look very nice because this is basically

109
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,214
- instead of delta omega two as a variable, just call it X,

110
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:27,584
and you end up with x double dot plus KX equal to zero.

111
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:30,550
And if you have any information about a spring mass system,

112
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,839
the only way this is going to be stable

113
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,745
and give you oscillatory part, is you have to have positive stiffness.

114
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:35,935
All right?

115
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,834
So we have to design this k.

116
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:41,470
This is not really a spring, this is just a mathematical coefficient

117
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,824
that comes out of this - this dynamical system.

118
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:49,569
So we have to pick inertias and spins and nominal things such that k

119
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,689
is going to be positive.

120
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,259
Right?

121
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,919
That's going to give us stability for the other two axes.

122
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,435
The first axis is just going to be marginal.

123
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:00,410
That's all you get.

124
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,639
Now, in this case, I have different ways to break it down.

125
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,410
Essentially, you have one bracketed term times a second bracketed term.

126
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,904
It has to be positive.

127
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:14,224
So Lucas, what can you say about the signs of the bracketed terms?

128
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:22,080
What must be true of them for this to be stable?

129
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,569
They have to cancel with each other.

130
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,329
How do you cancel?

131
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:28,089
What would you mean by canceling sines?

132
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,325
Does this first bracketed term have to be positive or negative?

133
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,209
And what the second bracketed term has to be?

134
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,428
Not sure.

135
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,049
All right.

136
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:39,105
We want the product of two terms to be positive.

137
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:43,660
So what must be true of the elements of that product?

138
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:43,660
They're both positive or both negative.

139
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,255
Right.

140
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:48,269
As long as they're the same sign, we are good.

141
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,910
Don't just jump right to well, this - if this has to

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,105
be positive, this has to be positive, this has to be positive.

143
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:53,430
That's not quite true.

144
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,290
That's a condition, but it's not the only condition.

145
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,930
Either we have positive-positive, which is stability, or positive-negative,

146
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,930
sorry, negative-negative, which is stability.

147
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,725
What you don't want to do is have positive times negative.

148
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,750
That would definitely be an unstable situation.

149
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,460
All right?

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,212
And that's - that's essentially, with all the math, that's what it breaks down.

151
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,985
So now, if we have some inertias

152
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:17,589
and we have some nominal spin rate, I want to spin about this axis at

153
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,855
two RPM, 50 RPM, whatever you're doing,

154
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:28,245
what allowable wheel speeds do I have to guarantee I have positive stiffness?

155
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:28,562
All right?

156
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,345
This is what it boils down to.

157
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,740
So we can rewrite this different ways from this parameter here, k,

158
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,129
I can factor out omega E1.

159
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,319
That means I divide this wheel speed by the nominal spacecraft spin rate

160
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,980
and that's what's omega hat.

161
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,824
You see, omega hat is just a normalized version of the wheel speed.

162
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,345
So if this is point one,

163
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,904
that means your wheel is rotating at 10 percent of the spacecraft speed.

164
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:58,910
If it's four, you're rotating four times faster than the spacecraft speed.

165
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,139
That's one way to look at it, it's a convenient way.

166
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,324
And then we factored out some other inertias and brought it back together.

167
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:09,180
This number squared is always going to be positive inertias, or hopefully positive.

168
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,740
Otherwise you have some imaginary system.

169
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,240
I'd be very interested in seeing that.

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,305
But then you're back to bracket times bracket.

171
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,420
But there's no more ratios.

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,360
It's a little bit simpler to look at.

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,649
And again, we need both of them to be positive or both of them to be negative.

174
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,915
Let's look at the one case.

175
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:34,740
We argued stability looking at pole hold plots if we don't have a wheel spinning, right?

176
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,679
So if we lock omega hat to be zero, we've got nothing but one rigid body

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,023
and we should be able to recover our results we saw from the pole hold plots,

178
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,210
which said without energy loss, spins about least inertia were stable,

179
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,870
spins about max inertia were stable - we've stayed close - but spins

180
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,529
about intermediate inertia were always unstable.

181
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,189
Right?

182
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:57,304
And we can see that if we look at this.

183
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:01,945
So if I take out the omega hat part, all you have is the difference between I1 and I3

184
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:03,614
and I1 and I2.

185
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:07,600
And you can readily see that if we have a spin about max inertia, if

186
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,504
B1 is a max inertia case,

187
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,759
then this difference has to be positive

188
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,865
because I1 is the biggest one, so negative

189
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:16,509
anything else is going to still be above zero; I1 minus

190
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,695
I2 also has to be positive, because

191
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:21,855
I1 is larger than I2; so positive-positive.

192
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:25,730
As we predicted with the pole hold plots, we're getting a stable response

193
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,855
in a linear sense.

194
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:32,134
And the least axis of inertia, if I1 is the smallest inertia,

195
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:35,959
then I1 minus I3 will be negative, I1 minus I2 will be negative

196
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,615
and we have negative-negative and we're also stable.

197
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,220
That's the axis of least inertia.

198
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,940
The skinny spin.

199
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,059
So linearly, they look stable.

200
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:44,495
We know already with energy loss -

201
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:46,639
and the pole holds actually gave us much more global

202
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,835
arguments, this is only for linearized local arguments -

203
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:53,044
but we regained the results that we had earlier.

204
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:57,210
Again, this is a classic result you should be able to do with those equations.

205
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,455
So let's look at non.

206
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:02,399
This is the condition we had if we do have the wheel speed.

207
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,919
So there's always two sets of conditions that comes out of this.

208
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,210
Either we pick a wheel speed such that this is bigger than zero - that means

209
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,029
I1 has to be bigger than this part, so I bring all

210
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,384
that to the right-hand side and that's what you have here -

211
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:20,894
or I1 has to be bigger than this part over here, which I brought to the right-hand side.

212
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,424
So you end up with two inequalities.

213
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,639
And both of them have to be satisfied, right?

214
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,895
If both of them are satisfied, you are positive-positive.

215
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:33,694
If Instead of greater than, if I flip the sine and say well if this one is less than,

216
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:37,121
that makes this negative, this is less than, that makes this negative.

217
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:39,019
So it's the same boundary points.

218
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,230
If you make it equal, you have two points on the wheel.

219
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,904
If you look at your wheel speed spectrum

220
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:45,050
- zero's in the middle, then you go left, right,

221
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,059
you will find two points that are critical,

222
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,534
where one bracketed term switches sines

223
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:52,519
and another point where another bracketed term switches sines.

224
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,262
Once you've identified them, you want to find out where you -

225
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,695
are you between the points, are you outside of those points?

226
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:01,900
What is the domain that makes it stable?

227
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,164
The beauty is we can do this regardless of the inertias.

228
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:11,039
So I can always actually enforce this condition.
