1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,870
We're doing a review of
what we covered last time.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,340
We had dual spinners.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,110
So with a dual spinner,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,230
I had some spacecraft,
didn't necessarily have to be symmetric.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,810
But this spacecraft has b1, b2,

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,681
b3 and
you'd have some panel attached to it.

7
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:31,343
So now, Nathan.

8
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,700
What do we do with the dual spinner?

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,950
What's the set up that we do here?

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,888
>> Well you have one section spinning
to maintain your angular momentum.

11
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:49,500
Or, so it's spinning about its axis of
minimum energy, so maximum inertia.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,918
>> Okay.
>> And then the other section is

13
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:57,000
not spinning essentially.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,030
>> Is that required?

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,070
Do we have to spin about an axis
of a minimum of inertia?

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,680
Does the second section have to be despun?

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,140
>> I guess not.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,450
>> No, in fact that's what I'm going
to show today through an example.

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,950
We can stabilize which is
the beauty of dual spinners.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,690
I can make any of the axis stable.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,385
Now if you have energy loss the minimum
inertia one you have to kind of be

22
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,950
a little bit more careful there's
some power equations you can find

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,480
on this stuff.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,280
But conceptually, we know without
energy loss this is a stable spin and

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,310
this is a stable spin.

26
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,870
But a spin about the access of
intermediate act inertia tends to

27
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,590
flip around and be unstable, all right?

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,840
So, with a dual spinner in this
mathematics, we have a fly wheel.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,470
How do we line up, Brett, how do we line
up this fly wheel in our dual spinner?

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,440
>> One of the body axis?

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,730
>> Yeah, one of the principal ones.

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,748
So, if we wanted to have a nominal spin
here, Omega1, that's my equilibrium spin.

33
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:53,870
I am going to add a wheel, which has
a spin axis, going to call it gs-hat,

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,510
that's my wheel spin axis,
which is the same thing as b1.

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,375
Those are lined up.

36
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:03,050
Good, then we went through,
how do we find equations of motion?

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,221
We still use H equal to L.

38
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:09,740
But H is now due to two rigid bodies.

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,590
And there's different ways to derive it.

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,910
We went through that last time.

41
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,690
There's angular momentum of the space
craft and the wheel that was I,

42
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,890
that was a summed I times omega plus the
wheel momentum routed to the spacecraft.

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,670
Or you can treat them as two separate
ones, I showed you that as well and

44
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,020
you can combine again.

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
That's a great problem that I've
used before in the final so

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,100
make sure you go through that.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,520
It's a good simple exercise.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,175
Later in class, you can do spacecraft
within variable speed CMGs.

49
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:40,175
It's the same process but
about 12 pages more algebra.

50
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:41,875
So this is where you want
to practice the process so

51
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,015
you don't get silly sign errors.

52
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:45,055
Then the rest of it just
kind of becomes mechanical.

53
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,035
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do this, and

54
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,335
you can use computer
tools as well to do that.

55
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,905
So practice this.

56
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,865
So we went through this.

57
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:58,360
Now I labeled this as an equilibrium
spin omega 1E, all right.

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,988
What does it mean Mandar
to be in equilibrium spin?

59
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:04,107
What does that mean?

60
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:08,290
[COUGH]
>> All Omega dots go to 0.

61
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,985
>> Exactly, any dynamical system, any
flow process or whatever you have, if you

62
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:19,605
have x dot equal to f, a nonlinear thing,
for [INAUDIBLE] xe is x dot equal to 0.

63
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:25,250
And the planar pendulum has one
equilibrium here, one equilibrium here.

64
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,860
Does this have anything to do with
stability, finding equilibrius?

65
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,940
No, which just it's a convenient point
about which we tend to discuss stability.

66
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,800
But stability is a separate concept
from finding equilibrius, all right.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,900
So we found the equilibrius and
in particularly for

68
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,660
the single rigid body there were three
equilibrium spins we discussed earlier.

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,060
Spinning about axis of least inertia,
maximum inertia, but

70
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,590
also intermediate inertia.

71
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
Those are equilibrium spins.

72
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,580
If you put it perfectly on
there it would tumble that way.

73
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
But if you bump it, if you perturb it,

74
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,210
that little delta that we were talking
about earlier, do you stay close?

75
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,740
What happens to my spin rates?

76
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,070
Right, do I wobble just a little bit and
stay there, which is true for

77
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,250
this kind of a thing?

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,920
But if I throw it this way you can see
it did several gyrations right away,

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,790
that's an unstable motion, all right?

80
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,140
That's what we're after now.

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,190
And so good, so
we identified while the single rigid

82
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,512
body could have equilibrium
spins about all three axis.

83
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,981
For the duel spinner
the equilibrium spins we end

84
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:35,370
up using is primarily
the one about the GS axis.

85
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,014
I say primarily,
let's look at that equation again.

86
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:45,914
[SOUND]
Here,

87
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:50,245
we argue that if I have a non-0
Omega 1 and Omega 2's and 3's are 0,

88
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,819
I always have all my dots.

89
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,050
Omega dots are going to be 0
like Mandar was saying earlier.

90
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,420
Perfect, but
you can also have Omega E1 be non-0.

91
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,850
Omega E2 is 0.

92
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,030
Which makes this 0 and this 0.

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,420
You could pick particular inertias, a
particular E1 at a particular wheel speed,

94
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,460
such that this combination with a non-0
omega E3 actually goes to 0 as well.

95
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,101
That's also an equilibrium, but
it's not one we typically fly,

96
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,663
because now all of a sudden you
have a very particular solution.

97
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,118
You have to have exactly this wheel speed.

98
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,683
If you're a little bit fast,
or little bit lower,

99
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,664
you're out of that equilibrium part.

100
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,824
Whereas this other spin we had if this
wheel speed is supposed to be 10 rpm and

101
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,832
I put in 11 rpm it's still
an equilibrium actually and

102
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,505
still going to hold the stair.

103
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:41,076
And so, we did that, here we just added
what is the equilibrium plus delta and

104
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:43,830
then dropped tie over terms, right?

105
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,960
And you end up with these
differential equations.

106
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,990
That it's stable,
if you can see here, again.

107
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,390
If instead of putting in that 10 rpm but
I gave it something slightly faster and

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,460
perturbed, this can hold that speed
because my angular acceleration about

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,070
the one axis,
the spin axis of the wheel, is just 0.

110
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,320
So you just stay there.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,940
The other two, tends to couple and

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,450
we have two first order differential
equations that are coupled and

113
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,300
the way we solve these was,
we differentiate again, substitute in.

114
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,770
So we replaced two coupled differential
equations with one second order decoupled

115
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,960
differential equation, and in the end,
it's all about these two bracketed terms.

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,540
This is your effective stiffness.

117
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,270
X doubled up plus K X,
K has to be positive right?

118
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,870
And either we make this positive or

119
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,250
this positive or
we make both bracketed terms negative.

120
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,650
Different ways we can write it?

121
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,323
We'll have in that example today,

122
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:41,040
you will see omega hat that's
a non-dimensionalized.

123
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,560
We take our wheel speed, 100 RPM,
divide by the spacecraft speed, 2 RPM, so

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,100
megahat would be 50 in this case.

125
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,200
It's a 50 multiplier factor between
the spacecraft spin and the wheel spin.

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,980
And then it just breaks down to
these inertias that you need.

127
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,680
And you have to pick spin speeds such
that both terms are positive, or

128
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,590
both terms are negative.

129
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,278
If you put in 0 spin speed we recover
the case of having a single rigid body.

130
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:11,630
And that's how we quickly found that this
stiffness is only going to be positive if

131
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,330
my inertia is either the maximum inertia,

132
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,930
that means we're doing the flat spin we
discussed earlier with the pole hose.

133
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,540
Or b1 is access of least inertia

134
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,190
which at least linearly without
energy loss is also stable.

135
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,134
So you see in here also mathematical
linearized proof of the stability

136
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,460
of the min and max inertia case.

137
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,670
The intermediate one gets positive and
negative, definitely not stable.

138
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,040
And the non-0 one in
the non-dimensionalized terms.

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,716
These are the conditions we need.
