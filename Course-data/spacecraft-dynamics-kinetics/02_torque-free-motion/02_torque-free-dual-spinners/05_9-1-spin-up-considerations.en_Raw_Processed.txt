okay we looking 
an old nominal big omegazero 
wheels accelerating 
we dont launch that way 
we launch everything locked 
we release 
in fact, craft will 
spin gets kicked 
we engaged wheel 
momentum happens 
settle in end 
youre spinning 
there classic 
answers we go 
so to begin with, whats commonly 
done dual spinners, 
theyre released spinning 
an axis thats aligned wheel 
wheel aligned b, so 
spacecraft, lets assume spinning 
b b combination 
thereof, something orthogonal to b 
so we want to this in end, 
spinning skinny, 
right 
this kind a tumble 
reaction wheel is spun 
if this is spinning, 
inertia one, 
a spin rate one, inertia times 
spin rate gives momentum one 
non dimensional units 
im going to spin wheel until 
momentum magnitude matches that 
space craft launch 
is one in this case, right 
now, in this kind a dynamical system is 
is angular momentum vector conserved 
tony 
no, theres a torque 
applied to spin 
right 
theres a torque 
torque is applied 
between two bodies 
wheel spacecraft 
okay so system im talking 
wheel spacecraft system 
okay 
is that an internal torque 
an external torque 
would an internal 
exactly 
so there is still external torque 
so combined hub wheel system, 
total momentum vector 
is we laugh used to derive 
equations motion like h dot equal to l 
that h still to fixed 
seen inertial observer 
so we use that 
so we want to really study 
happens to attitude we this 
spin up, right 
going to go this 
so initial spin rate, we said, 
tumbling here, right 
b, without loss generality, 
im tumbling a rate , 
inertia , gives momentum , 
thats i here 
spinning momentum 
wheel relative to body, 
that wheel 
inertia times big omega 
big omega omega 
wheel relative to b, right 
im simply omega dots, that tells 
little h is changing time 
going to 
constantly increase right 
input shaping 
something like that, 
going to ramp linearly 
until you hit desired speed 
desired speed will make little h 
equal to big h, thats we said 
so momentum wheel relative to 
craft is total momentum 
system 
so manuever time 
you figure 
well end i to this much 
thats constant rate 
you quickly compute 
this is going to take a hundred seconds, 
a thousand seconds depending 
quickly youre ramping 
wheel speed 
right 
this is long will take to 
reach this total amount momentum 
so we compute that 
nominally we launching like this, 
spinning right 
this wheel is going to spinning 
until momentum magnitude matches 
this spacecraft momentum time t, 
this is going to line 
is 
we argued total h vector 
to constant, right 
we cannot change total 
momentum this two body system 
internal torques tony saying 
so h is always same, 
always pointing in this drawing 
if wheel momentum is 
spacecraft initial momentum, 
wheel is spinning this axis 
since total momentum is 
momentum spacecraft plus 
momentum wheel, doesnt 
that mean spacecraft is despun, 
like nathan talking 
must lined this way 
now, way im asking that question, 
obviously answer is no, right 
trick is 

attitudes that allow 
you to little h equal to big h, 
im lining perfectly 
onzo, you think 
i cant think anything 
top head 
ideas 
think this 
right weve 
talking magnitudes 
we to add really is vectors, 
ang momentum vector body plus 
ang momentum vector wheels 
yes 
depending direction that you 
well no, we spinning 
okay, so you assuming 
locked in, there, right 
is dependent 
direction vectors 
little h is equal to 
magnitude initial big h 
doesnt mean two directions 
to 
thats essentially, this is 
initial h that we have, this system 
this is we launched, wheels 
locked down, speeding 
and, ends wheel a vector 
magnitude that is 
initial magnitude system 
little h equal to big h, 
scalars 
you could two vectors 
that magnitude 
in direction 
this is actually 
spacecraft body must 
so this momentum vector plus this one 
add to original 
we argue we cannot 
change initial momentum 
so, this maneuver, 
guaranteed, we, typically, 
spacecraft launched this way, 
want to line like this 
we talked boeing 
geostats that always point 
earth, skinny ones like this 
you want to nice even 
theyre this big wobble 
call this coning motion 
this is coning angle 
that you see right here 
so wed like to zero, 
typically zero happens 
theres different ways to explain 
is happening, basically this momentum 
matching guarantee doesnt enforce that 
two things actually line 
analysis this 
gets rather complicated 
typically we to, 
i will show you numerical 
results to kind talk this 
we dont nice analytic answers 
to guarantee behaviors, 
we study this stuff 
i mean theres lots theories 
behind this im giving a spin 
initially tom blake youre omega 
omega degrees per second 
wheel inertia, spacecraft stuff, 
everythings locked 
this gives an initial big h, momentum 
im going to go ahead start 
spinning that wheel a constant rate 
so i took equations motion 
you saw earlier, last class, 
im integrating initial 
conditions also tracking attitude 
im tracking omega i used 
euler angles and, i forget i used, 
something, maybe mrps 
two hundred seconds, 
i finished that maneuver 
you saw two hundred seconds, 
we close to lined like this 
there still a little bit 
a wobble left, that happens there 
so 
that amount wobble, thats whats 
happening amplitudes here 
we predict that 
see whats happening 
so we get close quite there 
here im taking a thousand seconds, 
im taking a lot time 
so itll take a minute to run 
you see simulations running 
keeps wobbling spinning 
a much gradual process 
so whats going to happen 
in this process is itll take, 
obviously takes time to roll up, 
if you look final omega twos 
like plus minus seven 
degrees even axis bigger, 
we will less a coning 
angle end this maneuver 
so gets close there well 
want to take a look that 
thats general trends 
we in systems 
a dual spinner spinning 
up, we dont want to aggressive 
you end this huge 
momentum vector to side 
you really have, 
you to stuff 
you want to a coning 
angle small possible so 
a little patience goes a long way 
take a little bit longer 
to spin this thing 
that point, 
you a smaller coning angle 
so will get there 
halfway there 
way we get rid this coning angle, 
you could use thrusters, 
in end if you want 
to change attitude 
you could apply h dot equal to l, apply 
thrusters, in right control 
change that momentum vector 
body, puff back place 
using fuel, 
we hate using fuel in space 
theres an elegant method that people 
devised called mutation damper 
anybody heard a mutation damper 

is you put basically 
a ball in a tube slush, 
oil, something highly viscous 
so creates friction 
so losing energy 
right 
we want to is spin 
omega one in end so 
you make that damper, you line that 
tube slush along either b 
so if youre still wobbling 
conic motion, 
youre always actually exciting that 
slosh, youre losing energy 
people shown this stuff, 
end would actually get rid 
coning motion completely 
that goes there 
weve used this a turn project in 
past people to integrate 
this study spin 
go that 
a fun project actually 
so take away notes is spin up, 
you match momentum magnitudes 
doesnt mean youve matched vectors 
teaching vectors 
patience goes a long way 
to get rid coning angle, you want 
to put a mutation damper orthogonal 
thatll get rid energies 
modes here time, 
itll settle in place 
theres kinds of, 
you look mutation dampers 
heres results 
so two hundred seconds 
you see you 
a thousand seconds, 
you know, five times longer, 
weve improved a factor two 
theres really, an asintotic thing 
so if you want to get even closer, 
you might take a long time 
thats where, 
patient you, you know 
a little bit mutation 
damping go a long way, 
get rid coning motion 
things are, weve seen plots 
im going to go this, 
reasonably highlevel 
to show you, plots also 
applied rigid bodies, 
also systems rigid bodies like 
wheels dual spinners 
energy here, this is really 
energy spacecraft only, 
here, real energy 
relative to spacecraft 
so part i w two, 
big omega squared 
so thats called e star 
total momentum energy system 
is before, momentum sphere 
to constant, even internal 
torques acting theyre internal 
theyre changing total 
momentum system 
is kind nice, 
thats a constraint 
so we rewrite energy 
ellipsoid spacecraft 
in terms coordinates 
a little math this is you, 
this is you come 
so energy that you have, 
momentum one axis is due to 
wheel due to spacecraft, so 
you to pull wheel momentum 
divide right stuff 
to come energy terms 
spacecraft one axis 
two three axis look like 
this is a sphere, this is still an 
ellipsoid, a shifted ellipsoid 
if h one two threes essentially 
x, y, z, independent coordinates 
if you go look classic 
ellipsoidal equation 
if you didnt minus h this would 
a centered ellipsoid thats there, 
minus h, actually shifts 
that ellipsoid along one access 
so we spin wheel that 
energy ellipsoid is going to move 
thats you see here 
initially we launched 
spacecraft spin is here 
we spinning purely b in 
that numerical problem i showed you 
we spin wheel 
you see momentum 
coordinates that we to satisfy 
thats total momentum 
coordinates spacecraft 
intersects energy in here 
energy ellipsoid starts to shrink 
inside spacecraft cause 
we spin wheel spacecraft tends 
to despin change orientation 
although momentum wed like 
to go wheels 
so theres different critical points 
one point this ellypsoid intercepts 
in this nice figure eight motion 
this kind a separate trick stuff 
that weve seen rigid bodies 
momentum magnitude 
matches, this is you end 
you match momentum magnitudes 
doesnt guarantee that youve despun 
primary body completely 
this is a mutation damper would 
help get rid that remaining energy 
make that actually attractive 
collapse onto a point 
thats would happening there 
so im kind showing 
this a pictorial thing 
so youve seen this 
something thatll exam 
plots, graphical 
visualizations momentum 
energy quite powerful 
if you read a lot 
classical attitude control, 
you will see kind tools 
used in different areas
