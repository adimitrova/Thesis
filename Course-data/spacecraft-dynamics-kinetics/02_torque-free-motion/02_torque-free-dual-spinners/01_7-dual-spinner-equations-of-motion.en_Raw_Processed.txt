we wrapped premotion, right 
so thats a spacecraft tumbling 
theres different ways to write 
we predict angular velocities if axisymmetric analytically in a closed form 
if axisymmetric general,there homogeneous 
undamped duffing equations that we write,which is kind elegant, 
that in current homework you will actually apply this different ways 
moving to next is different ways to start, 
a rigidbody spinning trying to stable, 
cause that doesnt always work 
a common design that moved us torquefree motion, 
people looked natural equilibrias a one single solid spacecraft, 
thats simplest thing you build, theres moving parts 
limitations axis you to pretty much spin 
axis max inertia if you wanna turn stable energy loss 
going to look different systems 
dualspinner is a pop used to a popular design geo satellites 
still built 
i think cassini is actually a dual spinner 
this huge platform that spun a different 
range lower platform helps stability well 
so thats a classic result that still applies 
gonna look also gravity gradients 
thats way people build satellites exploit 
differential gravity to stabilize spacecraft 
so, passive weight 
we dont active feedback sensing 
i pointing, i going, i close this loop 
that will in third part class we talk 
nonlinear control feedback control developments 
kind putting gonna a little bit theory control theory 
you get basics basic that we need this class 
im giving a whole class nonlinear control, 
this is specifics you need, thisand this is we apply 
specifically attitude control problem 
right 
so, dual spin gravity gradient, passive ways to stabilize a spacecraft 
so lets look this 
we write is im modeling spacecraft like this 
this doesnt necessarily to an axisymmetric body 
i drew a cylinder cause easy to draw 
i is a coordinate frame b, thats a principle coordinate frame, 
we know means, ive chosen an option 
inertia tensor becomes a diagonal 
right 
so, you that im lining spin wheel 
spin axis is lined one principal axis, 
without loss in generality, i called first one 
right 
so, thats this thing is lined 
so, this flywheel a speed, big omega, 
thats speed relative to body 
if you zero big omega, that means this body acts a single rigidbody 
you know, brakes failed clamped 
if spacecraft tumbles wheel tumbles, right 
if you a nonzero omega, 
that means wheel is moving so a way now, basically, two rigidbodies 
looking flexing this point 
a multibody system that actually solving this 
so, lets start looking things 
going to use, before, we use h dot equal to l a single rigidbody 
going to h dot equal to l this twobody system 
first thing we need is to get momentum 
different ways to write this 
is is inertia tensor spacecraft 
iw is inertia tensor this flywheel, this is a full three three, right 
but, since ive chosen a b frame is is a diagonal, 
you see this flywheel is symmetric 
so a unique inertia im calling that inertia, iw 
along spin axis 
theres two transverse inertias that equal 
in b one, two, three frame also gonna an is diagonal matrix 
b frame is principal frame spacecraft, 
this wheel symmetry assumption 
so, that, actually, you a combined sector 
i is actually combined spacecraft plus wheel inertia tensor, 
also gonna diagonal 
a diagonal plus a diagonal gives you a diagonal 
so, im calling i one, two, three 
wheel inertia b one, spin axis, is going to iw scalar 
convenience 
now, thats inertia tensor, we want to write angular momentum 
different ways you add contributions 
one way is, you could say, ok, spacecraft is spinning, 
you see, this is actually lined in cg 
cg wheel, cga spacecraft, coincidence here 
doesnt to 
if coincident, 
that part mass is like a bolt one meter removed, 
you use parallel axis theorem, adjust inertia tensor spacecraft 
thats you typically 
so, without loss in generality we typically write this way 
here, im showing you one way im saying, total inertia times omega, 
thats really gonna inertia spacecraft times omega, 
makes sense that omega is b relative to n 
thats classic angular momentum youve seen 
then, wheel momentum is gonna wheel inertia times omega w relative to 
andand im gonna break that actually mathematics here 
so we i is equal to is plus iw 
if im saying now, 
is times omega bn, thats momentum spacecraft 
sorry, is times omega bn, iw, i need angular velocity w relative to n 
w relative to n is simply gonna big omega times b one plus omega b relative to n 
this is angular velocity wheel frame relative to body, alright 
that omega defined relative to body frame 
so, like in that exam problem you feet, 
that second angled part one defined relative to first link, you know, 
this is comes conveniently 
so, that makes easy 
so weve got this, 
so this is really gonna expanded iw times omega bn plus iw times 
this part, alright 
this this combines to is plus iw times omega bn, 
plus this part is really a three three that you 
this in b frame, cause thats principal frame wheel, 
angular velocity is gonna omega zero, zero, in b frame 
if you use b frame components 
so, you see this youre gonna get is 
this inertia is iw times omega, 
ones dont matter cause theyre multiplied times zero 
so, end result, 
this thing becomes iw, big omega, thats in axis 
so, if you carry this out, you would get this zero, zero 
thats thing b one hat times that 
this is nothing inertia tensor times this 
so, things added 
different ways you get to it, alright 
so, here im a little bit a direct way, 
i kind this implicitly 
ok, this is angular momentum if wheel locked, 
im adding angular momentum wheel relative to body 
different ways you approach 
try different ways cause always give you same, 
simple derivations 
this is prime stuff a final exam 
you know, i something you do, you able to 
so, we h written out, 
this tensor, im specifying particular frames this point 
anyway, just, adds 
so, we need h dot equal to l 
gonna choose to differentiate this vector seen body frame 

we know seen body frame, thethe i primes will zero 
we to add omega crossed, there is momentum vector again, alright 
thing is we a single rigidbody, 
applying to this dualspinner 
this part looks like rigidbody, is actually inertias two 
rigidbodies, if one locked relative to other, gives you results 
so, youd body frame derivative 
omega, is thing inertial derivative omega, alright 
cause omega bn, crossed products vanish 
so, this gets you exactly parts plus omega cross this vector, 
that gets you omega till i omega 
so, this part is like a single rigidbody, 
a if that if thats if thats, 
if that wheel locks in, is a single rigidbody, alright 
essentially 
thats one way to look 
this second part 
people typically call this momentum wheel relative to body, 
a little h, little a lowercase h 
you see this often in literature, so im gonna use notation 
so, iw a this is a little h 
so, seen body frame, this wheel change speed, spin up, 
spin 
so, ill an h dot in b one, omega crossed hb 
this vector, to equal to external torque 
so, if you carry this out, you plug in omega omega one b one, 
omega two b two, omega three b three, 
you cross b one, you know to that, b one b ones cancel, 
b two b ones give minus b three, b three, b one, gives you minus b two, 
everything is moved to side 
so, we have, like ill make a dot equal to this, thats like a single rigidbody 
i dropped l this point saying, lets look a torquefree motion case, 
rest gyroscopics also brought to righthand side 
to wheel gyroscopics that come in 
if you change wheel speed, you get effect along b one 
if you spinning youre tumbling spacecraft 
wheel is spinning youre tumbling, 
theres cross coupling terms that appear in here 
alight 
thats 
i derived equations a dualspinner 
spin rate doesnt even to constant 
so, lets look this 
this is written in a complete 
tensor notation, so this doesnt to a principal frame actually 
this still works even without that assumption 
if we assume a principle frame, we write this a diagonal 
this part, omega till i omega, if this i is a diagonal, 
simplifies like a single rigidbody 
terms, we something in b one, two, 
three direction, we rewrite this 
this is gyroscopics a spinning accelerating wheel there 
thats impacts a spacecraft
