1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,167
We have wrapped up for pre-motion, right?

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,970
So that's a spacecraft tumbling.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,320
There's different ways to write it.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,699
We can predict the angular velocities if it's axisymmetric analytically in a closed form.

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,480
If it's not axisymmetric general,there were these homogeneous

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,789
undamped duffing equations that we can write,which is kind of elegant,

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,500
that in your current homework you will actually apply this different ways.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,270
What we're moving to next is different ways to start,

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,655
not just having a rigidbody by itself spinning and trying to be stable,

10
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,590
'cause that doesn't always work out.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,799
A common design that moved us from torque-free motion,

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,838
where people looked at natural equilibrias of a -one single solid spacecraft,

13
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,789
that's the simplest thing you can build, there's no moving parts.

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,640
But it has limitations about which axis you have to pretty much spin about

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,054
axis of max inertia if you wanna turn stable with energy loss.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,240
Now we're going to look at different systems.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,810
The Dual-Spinner is a pop --- used to be a very popular design for GEO satellites.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,395
It's still being built for some of them.

19
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,290
I think Cassini is actually a dual spinner.

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,269
It has this huge platform that spun at a different

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,135
range than the lower platform and it helps the stability as well.

22
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,950
And so that's a very classic result that still applies.

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,730
Then we're gonna look at also gravity gradients.

24
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,474
That's the way people build satellites with it ---exploit

25
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:20,635
differential gravity to stabilize the spacecraft.

26
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,730
So, but those are all passive weight.

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,810
We don't have any active feedback sensing.

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,200
Where am I pointing, where should I be going, and how do I close this loop.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,379
That will be then in the third part of the class where we talk about

30
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,194
nonlinear control for the feedback control developments.

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,519
We're kind of putting --- we're gonna have a little bit of theory on control theory.

32
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,430
You get all the basics basic that we just need for this class.

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,329
I'm not giving a whole class on nonlinear control,

34
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,454
but this is the specifics you need, and this-and this is how we apply it

35
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,670
specifically for the attitude control problem.

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,269
All right?

37
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:58,194
So, now dual spin and gravity gradient, those are passive ways to stabilize a spacecraft.

38
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:05,700
So let's look at this.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,155
What we can write is --- I'm just modeling my spacecraft like this.

40
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,689
This doesn't necessarily have to be an axisymmetric body.

41
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,139
I just drew a cylinder cause it was easy to draw.

42
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,560
What I do have is a coordinate frame B, that's a principle coordinate frame,

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,379
which we now know means, I've chosen an option

44
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,180
where my inertia tensor just becomes a diagonal.

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,807
All right?

46
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:30,254
So, you have that and I'm lining up my spin wheel with

47
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:33,730
where its spin axis is lined up with one of my principal axis,

48
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,860
and just without loss in generality, I just called it the first one.

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,060
All right.

50
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,335
So, that's how this thing is lined up.

51
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:43,680
So, this flywheel can have a speed, big Omega,

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,125
that's the speed it has relative to the body.

53
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:52,629
If you zero big Omega, that means this body now acts as a single rigidbody.

54
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,479
You know, the brakes failed and they clamped up

55
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,310
and if the spacecraft tumbles the wheel tumbles, right?

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,479
But if you have a non-zero Omega,

57
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,769
that means the wheel is moving so it's a way of having now, basically, two rigidbodies.

58
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,180
We're not looking at flexing at this point

59
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,335
but it's a multi-body system that we're actually solving with this.

60
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:13,555
So, let's start looking at these things.

61
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:17,879
We're going to use, as before, we use H dot equal to L for a single rigidbody.

62
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,500
We're going to do H dot equal to L for this two-body system.

63
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,680
And the first thing we need is to get momentum.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,305
Different ways to write this.

65
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:31,175
IS is my inertia tensor of the spacecraft.

66
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:38,730
IW is the inertia tensor of this flywheel, and this is a full three by three, all right?

67
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,817
But, since I've chosen a B frame where IS is a diagonal,

68
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:46,659
and you can see this flywheel is symmetric

69
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,750
so it has a unique inertia - I'm just calling that inertia, IW -

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,240
along the spin axis.

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,180
And then there's two transverse inertias that are equal.

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,509
But in the B one, two, and three frame it's also gonna be an IS diagonal matrix.

73
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,180
The B frame is both the principal frame for the spacecraft,

74
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,740
and for this wheel because of the symmetry assumption.

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,253
So, from that, actually, you can have a combined sector.

76
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:15,175
I is actually the combined spacecraft plus wheel inertia tensor,

77
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,675
and it's also gonna be diagonal.

78
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,014
A diagonal plus a diagonal gives you a diagonal.

79
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,377
So, I'm just calling these I one, two, and three.

80
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:27,079
The wheel inertia about B one, its spin axis, is just going to be IW the scalar of it.

81
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,179
For convenience.

82
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:34,500
Now, that's the inertia tensor, now we want to write angular momentum.

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,430
Different ways you can add up the contributions.

84
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,659
One way is, you could say, 'OK, the spacecraft is spinning',

85
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,279
and you can see, this is actually lined up in the CG.

86
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,610
The CG of the wheel, the CGA of the spacecraft, they are coincidence here.

87
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,884
It doesn't have to be.

88
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,285
If it's not coincident,

89
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,254
that part of the mass is like having a bolt one meter removed,

90
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:57,350
you just use parallel axis theorem, and adjust the inertia tensor of the spacecraft.

91
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,911
That's what you typically do.

92
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:02,069
So, without loss of in generality we can typically write it this way.

93
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:07,555
But here, I'm showing you one way where I'm saying, the total inertia times Omega,

94
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:11,095
that's really gonna be the inertia of the spacecraft times Omega,

95
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,502
which makes sense that Omega is B relative to N.

96
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:17,865
That's the classic angular momentum you've seen.

97
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:27,389
Then, the wheel momentum is gonna be the wheel inertia times Omega W relative to...

98
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,569
And-and I'm gonna break that up actually into mathematics here.

99
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:40,295
So we have I is equal to IS plus IW.

100
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:44,470
And if I'm saying now,

101
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,975
IS times Omega BN, that's the momentum of the spacecraft.

102
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:58,766
Sorry, IS times Omega BN, and IW, I need the angular velocity of W relative to N.

103
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:07,783
But W relative to N is simply gonna be big Omega times B one plus Omega B relative to N.

104
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:13,235
This is your angular velocity of the wheel frame relative to the body, alright?

105
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:16,000
That Omega was defined relative to the body frame.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,420
So, like in that exam problem where you had feet,

107
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,250
that second angled part one defined relative to the first link, you know,

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,884
this is how it comes up conveniently.

109
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,149
So, that makes it easy.

110
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,079
So now we've got this,

111
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:37,014
so this is really gonna be expanded as IW times Omega BN plus IW times

112
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:40,534
this part, alright?

113
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:50,135
This and this combines to IS plus IW times Omega BN,

114
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:55,019
plus this part is really a three by three that you have.

115
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,295
And this in the B frame, 'cause that's the principal frame of the wheel,

116
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:03,056
and the angular velocity is just gonna be Omega zero, zero, in the B frame.

117
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,870
If you use B frame components.

118
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,125
So, you can see out of this all you're gonna get is

119
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,680
this inertia which is IW times Omega,

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,464
and these other ones don't matter cause they're all multiplied times zero.

121
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,470
So, out of the end result,

122
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,019
this thing just becomes IW, big Omega, and that's in the 1 axis.

123
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:29,290
So, if you carry this out, you would get this zero, zero.

124
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,649
And that's the same thing as B one hat times that.

125
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,819
This is nothing but the inertia tensor times this.

126
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,605
So, those things added up.

127
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:42,589
Different ways you can get to it, alright?

128
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:45,029
So, here I'm doing a little bit more of a direct way,

129
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,519
where I kind of doing this implicitly.

130
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,814
OK, this is the angular momentum as if the wheel were locked,

131
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:54,545
and then I'm adding the angular momentum of the wheel relative to the body.

132
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:55,694
Different ways you can approach it.

133
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:58,139
But try different ways cause it should always give you the same,

134
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,665
and these are simple derivations again.

135
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:01,560
This is prime stuff for a final exam.

136
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,615
You know, I can- something you can do, you should be able to do.

137
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,860
So, now we have H written out,

138
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,089
and this tensor, I'm not specifying any particular frames at this point.

139
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,254
Anyway, it just, it all adds up.

140
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:17,214
So, we need H dot equal to L.

141
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:20,279
We're gonna choose to differentiate this vector as seen by the body frame.

142
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,639
Why?

143
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,459
Because we know it's seen by the body frame, the-the I primes will be zero.

144
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,570
But then we have to add Omega crossed, there is momentum vector again, alright?

145
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,589
Same thing is what we did with a single rigidbody,

146
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,493
we're applying it to this dual-spinner now.

147
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:39,014
This part looks just like the rigidbody, which is actually have the inertias of two

148
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:43,769
rigidbodies, if one were locked relative to the other, and it gives you the same results.

149
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,455
So, you'd have the body frame derivative

150
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,320
of Omega, which is the same thing as the inertial derivative of Omega, alright?

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,889
Cause Omega BN, the crossed products vanish.

152
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:55,740
So, this gets you exactly the same parts plus Omega cross this vector,

153
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,269
that gets you Omega till the I Omega.

154
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,960
So, this part is just like a single rigidbody,

155
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,549
just a t- if that t- If that's- if that's,

156
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,934
if that wheel locks in, it is a single rigidbody, alright?

157
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:05,639
Essentially.

158
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,169
That's one way to look at it.

159
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,519
This second part.

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,629
People typically call this momentum of the wheel relative to the body,

161
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,196
a little h, little - a lowercase h.

162
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:18,235
You see this often in the literature, so I'm gonna use the same notation.

163
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,870
So, IW a - this is a little h.

164
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,759
So, as seen by the body frame, this wheel can change speed, it can spin up,

165
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,769
it can spin down.

166
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,009
So, I'll have an h dot in the B one, and then Omega crossed hB1.

167
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,485
This vector, it has to be equal to the external torque.

168
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:40,660
So, if you carry this out, you can plug in Omega as being Omega one B one,

169
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,350
Omega two B two, Omega three B three,

170
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,700
and you cross with B one, you know how to do that, the B one B ones cancel,

171
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,691
the B two B ones give minus B three, and then the B three, B one, gives you minus B two,

172
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,580
and then everything is moved over to the other side.

173
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,330
So, we have, like before I'll make a dot equal to this, that's like a single rigidbody.

174
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,690
I have dropped L at this point saying, 'Let's look at a torque-free motion case',

175
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,185
and the rest of the gyroscopics are also brought over to the right-hand side

176
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,815
to those are the wheel gyroscopics that come in.

177
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:16,414
If you change the wheel speed, you get some effect along B one.

178
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,590
If you just are spinning and you're tumbling with the spacecraft

179
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,236
and your wheel is spinning and you're tumbling,

180
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:25,110
there's some cross coupling terms that appear in here.

181
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,910
Alight?

182
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,850
But that's it.

183
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,865
I have now derived the equations of a dual-spinner

184
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:35,384
where the spin rate doesn't even have to be constant.

185
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,894
So, let's look at this more.

186
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:38,504
This is written in a complete

187
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,697
tensor notation, so this doesn't have to be a principal frame actually.

188
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:44,065
This still works even without that assumption.

189
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:48,615
But if we assume it's a principle frame, we can write this as a diagonal.

190
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,480
This other part, Omega till the I Omega, if this I is a diagonal,

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,095
it simplifies like with a single rigidbody.

192
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,879
And the other terms, we had something in the B one, two,

193
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,529
and three direction, we can rewrite into this.

194
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,254
This is the gyroscopics of having a spinning or accelerating wheel there.

195
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,789
That's how it impacts a spacecraft.
