Hi, and welcome to the fourth
segment of space craft kinetics.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,140
Here, we're going to be looking at the
complex equations of motion that you have

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,870
of a rigid space craft.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,670
But on it, we now have a series of fly
wheels or other momentum exchange devices.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,850
We'll be first studying
the different types of devices.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,550
There's reaction wheels,
there's control moment gyroscopes, and

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,080
then there's also variable speed CMGs.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,560
And then we'll develop the math.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,480
We'll actually develop the math in a more
complicated way than most general way with

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,730
the variable speed
control moment gyroscope.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,310
And then I'll show you how you
could simplify these equations

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,780
to retain the classical CMG and
reactional equations of motion.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,260
So this is a great classical treatment,
reaction wheels are used very,

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,400
very generally on spacecraft.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,600
Their big benefit is they
only need electrical energy,

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,740
there's no thrust involved
to do the attitude.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,730
Same thing with control
moment on the gyroscopes,

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,280
they're more expensive, but
they produce much bigger torques.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,130
And yes,
as you will see in the mathematics.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,710
They also give you more headaches and
much more mathematics.

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,591
So it's a lot of fun.
