1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,214
So what we want to do next is actually look at motor torque equations.

2
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:13,919
If we go and look at this differential equations,

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,494
this is in a vectorial form,

4
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,629
but really if you think of it in the scalar components,

5
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:20,687
how many differential equations does this line,

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,190
this boxed line give me?

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,880
Three.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,495
Three.

9
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:28,530
How many states does this system have?

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,425
Three?

11
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:34,795
Well, you have omegas. There's attitude,

12
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:37,565
but for attitude, we have the differential kinematic equations, right?

13
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:38,710
So attitude is always covered,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,549
so let's just ignore the attitude part.

15
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:41,859
But this differential equation,

16
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,575
you could solve for omega_dot.

17
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:46,765
Great. But what is Omega_dot?

18
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:50,795
Right? Per wheel, you don't know what that angular acceleration is gonna be.

19
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,859
What is gamma_double_dot?

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,369
We don't know that either.

21
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:57,130
So there's two extra degrees of freedom in this system.

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,000
Each mechanical device provided one additional degree of freedom because we have

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,045
a single-axis rotation going from body to gimbal, gimbal to wheel.

24
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,924
So this only gives you three differential equations.

25
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,840
We need five, and that's because we have one device.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,325
If we have five of these devices,

27
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,329
I need way more, but then this kind of becomes repetitive.

28
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,369
So we have let's say we have four VSCMGs,

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,560
this is still the equation you would use.

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,469
You would need this with summations over all the devices

31
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:24,769
and I'll show you how to do that.

32
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:28,119
But then we still need what's called the motor torque equations per device.

33
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,430
Because,ultimately, what you would simulate is, hey,

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,459
I'm putting in one newton-meter on that spin axis for

35
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,730
the reaction wheel and half a newton-meter on the gimbal axis.

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,415
What's the dynamic response gonna be? All right.

37
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,674
So we need these extra equations which we don't have yet.

38
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:44,129
So that's what we're gonna look at next.

39
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,204
How do we find these motor torque equations?

40
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,609
And essentially, we go back to the board and say, look,

41
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,989
we're looking at H_dot equal to L. If you think of it

42
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:59,403
as a free-body diagram – let me just draw that out.

43
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,840
If we think of this as a – you've got your wheel.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,594
Right. And here's the spin axis,

45
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:10,525
and the wheel is free to rotate about g_s.

46
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,430
There's your rotation.

47
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,097
Now Omega.

48
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:16,909
So this axis is a motor – I know there's

49
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,134
a motor torque that makes it accelerate about this axis.

50
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:22,534
If you have zero voltage with the motor broke,

51
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,784
it would be a free-spinning wheel as,

52
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:26,775
you know, it would spin up, spin down.

53
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,659
There's no motor torque applied.

54
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,159
This is very similar to that [inaudible] problem you did with

55
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,784
the cylinder and that rotisserie grill architecture.

56
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,865
Right? And it was the b-b_prime axis.

57
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,814
That was the axis where it was free to spin.

58
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:39,889
So if we had no motor torque,

59
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,164
this would be a free-spin axis.

60
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:45,104
With the motor torque, you get to control what torque is applied. All right.

61
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,525
So we know this is where our motor torque acts,

62
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,365
but this is just one axis.

63
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:56,194
You will have two other axes that are orthogonal to this.

64
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:59,479
And as the spacecraft is tumbling and moving – remember,

65
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,000
this axis has a particular orientation in

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,925
the craft – the structure has to actually produce these other two torques.

67
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,680
So, we can do H_dot equal to L,

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,585
about the center of mass of this wheel now,

69
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,294
which is what we kind of derived earlier already,

70
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:22,270
and we can then use that to relate and come up with a scalar equation that we need.

71
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,080
So that's what I'm showing you here.

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,340
So if you do this, H_dot equal to L –

73
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,629
the dynamical system is just the wheel – the only thing that

74
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,030
interfaces with the wheel is the motor torque in

75
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,604
one axis and then the structural torques along the other two.

76
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,430
That's what makes sure this wheel doesn't just flip

77
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,474
sideways relative to the gimbal frame, right?

78
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:44,969
As you gimbal it, you're specifying two of the three dimensions of the wheel.

79
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,884
It's the spin that's actually free.

80
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:49,981
So we can do this, and you've derived this already,

81
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:53,849
we had this result earlier when we derived the full equations of motion,

82
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,645
so I get to rewrite it again.

83
00:03:55,645 --> 00:04:00,750
And the trick now is we have to recognize here that H_dot equal to L,

84
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,810
that torque that's acting on just the wheel,

85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,129
the torque that's along the g_s axis must be what I call u_s.

86
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,930
That's the spin-axis motor torque.

87
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,835
The other two I'm calling tau.

88
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:18,855
Those are the structural torques that keep this wheel aligned relative to that.

89
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,600
If you needed to know what the structural torques were,

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,800
you're worried about breaking those hinges and bearings and stuff,

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,160
you can actually go back here and then do your simulation and then,

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,144
postprocessing, plug in all these states.

93
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,560
And all these g_t's and

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,185
g_g's are gonna be the structural torques that are acting on the system.

95
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:43,050
So this approach actually gives you the internal torques, if you want.

96
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,209
Now the equations of motion, I don't need them.

97
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,589
So what we do need to do is what is along the g_s axis,

98
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,279
that must be equal.

99
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,300
So here, you can see we've got only this part.

100
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,430
This part must be equal to the motor torque,

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,615
and that's where I find my motor torque equation here.

102
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:03,285
It's essentially the motor torque is the wheel inertia times

103
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:07,430
the angular acceleration plus these two other terms.

104
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,104
If we ignore gimbaling,

105
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:13,939
how big is your spacecraft acceleration compared to

106
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,934
wheel acceleration? What do you think?

107
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,024
About the same size?

108
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,419
An order of magnitude difference?

109
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,109
Two, three orders of magnitude difference?

110
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,735
How fast the spacecraft rotate, you think?

111
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:30,094
What's a fast speed with before they declare emergencies?

112
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:30,989
Three degrees a second?

113
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,509
Two degrees, three degrees,

114
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:35,709
just a couple of degrees per second, doesn't take much.

115
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,454
You know, how fast does the wheel go?

116
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:40,779
Maximum speed, 5-6,000 RPM, way faster.

117
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,605
So it's accelerations are gonna well exceed what the spacecraft.

118
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,810
So some people actually just go,

119
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,730
you know what, this is my motor torque equation,

120
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,910
which really makes your life simpler because it decouples this equation

121
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,564
completely from the attitude states and the gimbal states. But it's not the true thing.

122
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:55,795
Momentum won't be preserved if you do that.

123
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,814
This is the full answer that you have.

124
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:00,019
And in fact, if you're gimbaling at the same time,

125
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,825
the gimbal rate does cross-couple back into this torque.

126
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:05,634
There's a gyroscopic torque that you have to account for.

127
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:08,970
And so this is the full motor torque equation that you have.

128
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,824
Right? So now we have this extra differential equation we needed.

129
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:14,194
We had earlier one for omega_dot.

130
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,980
With this one, if I throw it in,

131
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,339
I can solve for this one.

132
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,300
But you can see it's also coupled to this one.

133
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,300
So you get linear systems of equations you have to solve simultaneously.

134
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,455
Or you could take this – I'll show you in a moment –

135
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,805
we can take this and back-substitute it in,

136
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,060
and this will give us

137
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,920
the reaction where only creations of motion that I'll show you – the classic results.

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,694
So, different ways you can formulate it.

139
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,610
So that's one extra differential equation.

140
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,514
We also need it for the gamma_double_dot.

141
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,495
That needs the motor torque u_g.

142
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:42,700
What's that torque there?

143
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,569
There, the dynamical system I'm using,

144
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,875
it's not just the gimbal frame,

145
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,105
but inside the gimbal frame is a wheel.

146
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:51,305
And the torques I'm worrying about is outside of the gimbal frame,

147
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,810
so the gimbal frame to body is where the motor torque is

148
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,805
attached between gimbal and body.

149
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:59,495
So, inside of it, the dynamical system is actually both

150
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:04,819
the wheel with the gyroscopics and the frame with its gyroscopics.

151
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:07,745
So we computed these h_dot's earlier.

152
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,139
If you sum them up, this is what you get.

153
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:16,389
And now, this stuff about the gimbal axis actually has to be equal to the motor torque.

154
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,689
The other two are the structural torques being produced.

155
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,645
So it's the same kind of a process, right?

156
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,670
Two structural.

157
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,860
This is the motor torque here that's really spinning

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,180
this combined – as you rotate the frame,

159
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,245
you're also rotating the wheel.

160
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,515
It's a combined system.

161
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,025
And you can come up, you can solve for this in the end

162
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,605
and then that's what you get.

163
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,709
So if you drop this and ignore other terms,

164
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,259
you could roughly say that torque is equal to inertia times angular acceleration,

165
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,110
but it's a pretty crude approximation.

166
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,814
This gives you the full coupling.

167
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,514
And you can see, if you have a torque,

168
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,975
you can get your angular acceleration for the gimbal,

169
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:51,019
but also you get the spacecraft angular acceleration coupling into it.

170
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:55,285
So, either you back-substitute or you solve it as a linear system of equations.

171
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,694
But now we actually have five differential equations

172
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,420
and given torques acting on the system,

173
