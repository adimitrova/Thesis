1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:13,952
Okay, so let's talk about control moment devices, here.

2
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:17,330
They're very popular.

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,980
Why do we like reaction wheels, CMG's.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,719
Brian?

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,950
You've heard of these devices right?

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,189
Yeah. Robustness?

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,450
Why robust?

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,464
I don't know. There's only...

9
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,159
It's just a spinning wheel and not a whole lot.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,585
We had that discussion this morning.

11
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:36,134
Yeah. You've heard of the Kepler mission?

12
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:39,890
Alright, But that was the thing that failed, is this spinning wheels.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,130
How can a spinning wheel fail?

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,685
Well, it's never quite...

15
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,335
But you know, it is that.

16
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,450
Right? Others might argue that a Kurd area of

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,579
research for example are these micro thrusters,

18
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,840
there's a lot of people coming up with

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,409
very very small little PPT thrusters and polaroid thrusters that put out in milli newton,

20
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,524
micro newton so that because otherwise if you have bigger thrusters.

21
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,909
Its one Newton or nothing.

22
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,905
A lot of the controls you do need like you know

23
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,789
10 million newton meters not 10 newton meters.

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,429
And so these thrusters are way too rough in how they do it?

25
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:07,959
They do... These devices do give you

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,250
subtle forces which is nice precision pointing. if you Think of Kepler.

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,909
They have to stare very carefully at the sky.

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,269
They don't want this rough on off actuation.

29
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,640
They want a really gentle subtle thing.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,295
And these devices give you that kind of a what they call control bandwidth right.

31
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:25,719
they just don`t have on off but I can do half or quarter

32
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,795
on or I can get infinitesimally smooth with a nice voltage based motor.

33
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,510
So. So that is good.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,750
They are simpler devices.

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,010
What's the other, what are other benefits that we could

36
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,420
have with momentum exchange devices?

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,072
Redundancy?

38
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,284
You might have redundancy,

39
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:46,269
but you could also have redundancy with thrusters if you wanted to, Right? Yeah Daniel.

40
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,702
You don't use fuel.

41
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:49,459
You don't use fuel, right.

42
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,685
In space, fuel is everything.

43
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,489
If you look at the control solutions that we develop very

44
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,349
often we have to be careful that we're not just fighting gravity all the time.

45
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,219
You know, whatever nature is doing if the sole pressure's trying to tilt to

46
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,670
five degrees and you go no I just want to be vertical just because you're fighting that.

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,264
That that torque all the time.

48
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,710
That means your wheels are going to spin up or are you using fuel

49
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,384
continuously and you know that's a bad thing in space,

50
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,319
so we always look for ways to be as one,

51
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,030
as much one with nature as possible.

52
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,194
Right, because we just can't afford to do anything else.

53
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:24,090
So that's a very important point.

54
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,525
These momentum exchange devices don't use fuel.

55
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,180
They use electrical energy and

56
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,150
electrical energy as long as your solar panels are there and they properly

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,761
deployed you know and there are

58
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,140
all these other little conditions then you can run this indefinitely.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,210
Now what's the challenge when you go into Pluto?

60
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,300
Do you think you could still use reaction wheels out of Pluto Spencer?

61
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,599
The sun's going to be too strong to generate enough electricity to power them.

62
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,419
So New Horizons How did they do attitude control?

63
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,449
Electric from an RTG?

64
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:55,040
So you still have reaction wheels.

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,715
You could have reaction wheels i actually don't

66
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,550
know if New Horizons used thrusters or reaction wheels.

67
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,110
I'm guessing they had reaction wheels on board,

68
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,729
but you'd have to have a different energy source.

69
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,770
Right. But it's still, okay.

70
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,870
It's not infinite like a solar panel but highly highly efficient.

71
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,569
So even in the deep space applications these wheels are quite nice.

72
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,930
You know we have means of generating electricity

73
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,039
far more easily than having tons and tons of fuel.

74
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,240
You know you can stash energy replenish your energy.

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,879
These RTG`s are much more compact than having all that fuel

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,879
that had to last all those years to do that.

77
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,169
So that's the big benefit.

78
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:32,139
All right, With momentum exchange devises what are some of the challenges though?

79
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,509
What do you think?

80
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,509
Zero crossings.

81
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,375
Used to be. So there is stickage.

82
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,654
Now the more I talk with manufacturers about this and you go look at the specs

83
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:47,389
they go zero crossings naah. That's so old school.

84
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,844
No. We don't worry about that anymore.

85
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,669
They can get good enough. And the issue we talked about was stickage.

86
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,538
If you go slow enough all of a sudden you

87
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,430
want to cross zero at a nice spin-off prescribed rate.

88
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,769
Once you get close enough all of a sudden it goes Uhh!

89
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,314
And it basically sticks and then you have to give it enough force to unstick it again.

90
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,905
And It gives you that slight wobble that Kepler really would hate.

91
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,819
You know, so you might have to worry about

92
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,544
zero crossing but they're getting really good with these things now.

93
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,130
So that becomes less of an issue. What are other ones.Ryan?

94
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,659
Russell.

95
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,109
Russell.

96
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,240
De-spinning the wheel?

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,050
Momentum management.

98
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,745
That's something we'll keep talking about.

99
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,829
So in the equation we developed you will see,

100
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,689
hey this works. This works infinitely.

101
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,165
But keep in mind these wheel speeds

102
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,610
in the mathematics actually can grow infinitely large.

103
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,560
And in reality you can't do that.

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,805
Your wheel will literally fall apart at some point.

105
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,740
It's spinning so fast.

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,800
What are other issues that you have with these devices?

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,569
The momentum management, it will be true for CMG's and for reaction wheels.

108
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,399
We don't cover much of them in this class the follow on 6010 goes into

109
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,610
way more detail on momentum management because its a whole complexity.

110
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,800
Or CMGCO's singularities if they line up.

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,519
Right. Usually comes out of momentum management issues but there are also

112
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,620
controllability problems that sometimes with

113
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,204
these devices you may not be able to produce general torques.

114
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,730
So there's classic CMG singularity that we must about to talk about.

115
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm going to show them here but don't go,

116
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,129
We're running out of time doing the details 6010

117
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,079
goes in way more details from this stuff,

118
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,964
but yeah they appear.

119
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:12,519
But also you basically got this washing machine right,

120
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,735
something that's shaking and rattling and going around.

121
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:21,489
How balanced is that wheel typically?

122
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,334
Pretty good hopefully.

123
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,299
But is it perfectly balanced?

124
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:28,894
Right, never. Nothing in life is absolutely perfectly balanced.

125
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:32,560
So you're actually you know its like having a little imbalanced mass.

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,829
And the faster you're spinning you're putting continuously now

127
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:40,235
a slight shake and disturbance on the craft at the frequency of the wheel.

128
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:43,360
So if you consider internal modes fuel slosh.

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,875
Panels that might be flexing

130
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,699
structural resonances your sense of platform has to be very steady because you want to

131
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,740
stare at the stars with Kepler and it has

132
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,529
a certain natural frequency and if you hit that natural frequency with these wheels,

133
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,209
you might be exciting a little bit more than you want it, you know.

134
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,610
So you have to worry about those things,

135
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,345
so balancing of the stuff.

136
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:04,449
Modeling in bound in class with an all perfectly balanced.

137
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,199
In modeling one has some current students who are

138
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,139
just not publishing papers in the full stuff.

139
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,018
It's amazing how this little one motor torque equation that takes up this much space,

140
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:14,954
takes up like a page all of a sudden.

141
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,089
If you do the full model.

142
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,564
So there's some papers, if you're curious I can point you to.

143
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:23,754
So big benefits, no fuel that's really the biggest thing but also fine tune control.

144
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,545
That's really important if you have to do just

145
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:29,545
very just a smidgen left you know kind of control.

146
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:33,129
But there's challenges with all these devices and the mathematics.

147
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,949
So this is typically what they look like this is a very simple reaction wheel,

148
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,420
some of them just basically spinning discs,

149
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,004
a blob of mass, some electronics something that holds it together in case it breaks.

150
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,089
You don't want to smash everything else it becomes a bomb essentially.

151
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:49,746
So it has to hold itself together as it's a material but with reaction wheels,

152
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:52,199
the key is this is all bolted down.

153
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,144
I like this picture because it looks kind of beefy you know.

154
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,269
Just remember this wheel is bolted down.

155
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,540
In the mathematics for a reaction wheel we'll always

156
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,175
assume that all those axes are fixed.

157
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,639
The spin axis doesn't,

158
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,029
you know change with respect to the body.

159
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,959
So we have body fixed spin axis.

160
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,819
You can have multiple wheels to generate arbitrary torque.

161
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,750
Each wheel you just get to a torque about the spin axis.

162
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,470
You apply one Newton meter torque.

163
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,675
Then you get a minus 1 Newton meter torque back onto the craft right, at Newton's laws.

164
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,704
You push with one Newton you get pushback back at one Newton.

165
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:25,954
That's the same principle.

166
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,254
There is no amplification there's nothing to generate

167
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:30,699
a general three dimensional torque vector.

168
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,209
You didn't have to go this one has to produce 0.2 meter,

169
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,564
this one 0.5, this one 0.3 and you spin them off at particular ways.

170
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,459
Right. And we'll see that in the mathematics.

171
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,415
How do we arrange these,

172
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,954
from a torque command onto wheel speed commands.

173
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,359
But they can saturate.

174
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:49,029
No wheel can spin infinitely fast and that's a problem.

175
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,199
To apply a torque it has to be spinning up the wheel.

176
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,329
So if you're persistently pushing on the craft like atmospheric drag might do.

177
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,560
And you're holding an attitude that's not in equilibrium with that drag,

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,564
you're pushing back with the wheels to hold the attitude.

179
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:06,235
And that means continuously you're spinning up that wheel more

180
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,149
and more and more and more and at some point it just goes okay,

181
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,279
I'm done. I'm taking off.

182
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,560
We may run into heat issues.

183
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,819
Heat can be an issue as well.

184
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,569
Other ones to look like this.

185
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,064
Here are some ITHACO ones.

186
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,500
These might be very same that was flying on Kepler.

187
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,430
Often look pancake shaped.

188
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,410
Why do these high end wheels often look more like a pancake?

189
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,549
Why not make them skinny, long like a cork bar or something.

190
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,549
But you kind of put the big rod with the wheel out there. What do you think?

191
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:36,614
Bigger torque.

192
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:36,622
Sorry?

193
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,180
You have a bigger torque for your speed.

194
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,039
Technically correct because the motor torque,

195
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,490
or whatever that motor produces That's a torque you get back on the craft.

196
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,610
Pressure is on the outside.

197
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,183
The Inertia is the big thing. The bigger,

198
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:54,044
the more out you put your wheel inertia,

199
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,750
as the wheel mass the bigger the inertia is going to be.

200
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,149
So if you look at 1D rotation where you have

201
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,245
i times the anglular acceleration equal to torque,

202
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:05,870
the angular acceleration will be smaller.

203
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,235
If you have more inertia.

204
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,440
Right if it's a beefier wheel that means

205
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,620
more inertia and you put the 1 newton meter torque on there.

206
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,149
You're not going to spin up as much.

207
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,809
That means they don't saturate as quickly and that's a nice thing.

208
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,909
You're still storing the same amount of momentum,

209
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,320
torque times time gives you momentum.

210
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,754
So the more momentum we store you will find

211
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,679
every one of these wheels introduces new gyroscopics.

212
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,483
With the dual spinner,

213
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:32,059
we looked about which wheel speed should we have such that

214
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,075
the gyroscopics actually help us or if you're evil,

215
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,340
don't help you and destabilize it, right.

216
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,075
There's both that you can do with this stuff.

217
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:43,070
Now we'll see the same effects happening in a general wheel configuration.

218
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,335
All right. So the more momentum you have it makes it really stable.

219
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,559
But if you have to point here and then point over here very

220
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,174
quickly the momentum will work against you.

221
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:56,575
The more stable it is the harder it is sometimes to move it.

222
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,879
That's what stability gives you.

223
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,605
But that's why these things are flat.

224
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,879
We have so much mass they give you 10 kilograms the

225
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,549
best you can do is a ring of 10 kilograms all the way out.

226
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,659
In reality you need something around it to hold it together.

227
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,820
You need some thin spokes to hold it together.

228
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,500
You need enough stiffness so these things don't vibrate like crazy

229
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,440
or you know start having other modes that get excited.

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
So there's always a tradeoff but you do like as much mass as possible out.

231
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,164
That gets you the most inertia for the mass that you're allocated for this device.

232
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:27,075
Good if you look inside you can see it's basically this.

233
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,605
Most of the mass is out here.

234
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:30,019
This one happens to have a flat but it's

235
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,379
a very thin kind of thing that comes out, they have certain shapes.

236
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,950
This is all for structural purposes.

237
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,125
You're looking at resonances,

238
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,235
trying to make it a hyper stable wheel.

239
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,899
You don't want this thing to beat off balance washing machine thing.

240
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,085
So a lot of effort goes into that and they're getting really good these days.

241
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,350
And there is always some electronics that drives it.

242
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,294
Some of them are analog. Many of them,

243
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:52,304
some of the cool ones I've seen from Germany these days are digital.

244
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:55,970
You just basically give it a command and it does everything, tracks it's friction,

245
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,169
tracks it's zero crossing,

246
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:01,669
tracks its heat, if it gets too hot it automatically cuts down.

247
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,259
So there are some really nice what they call smart

248
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,870
reaction wheels that we've seen there too.

249
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,634
You can find those on the web. Honeywell makes also,

250
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,570
they are a huge reactionary manufacturer that make up a lot of these devices.

251
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,575
Now Control Moment Gyroscope look very similar.

252
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,125
Same pancake. That means we've got a spinning disk.

253
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,629
We want as much inertia as possible and there's

254
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:23,284
still a motor in here actually that controls the wheel speed,

255
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:28,690
because in fact none of these devices launch start up like with the dual spinner.

256
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,889
Once you're in the craft it's all bolted down,

257
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,809
and once you're up there you have to figure out how

258
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,184
do I now spin up this whole system. All right.

259
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,024
So with a CMG, what's different from a reaction wheel,

260
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,950
a reaction wheel, Ideally you'd like to have around

261
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,379
zero speed ish or at least a low speed.

262
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,679
The higher the speed you will see from

263
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,294
a motor torque equation and we've seen the work energy principle already.

264
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:51,019
It will cause more power be required. So we want the speeds low.

265
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,309
With a CMG, we want a high speed because the thing

266
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:00,409
that drives us here is not the motor torque actually but the gyroscopic effect.

267
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,617
I'm assuming you've all done this experiment with the bicycle wheel you spin it up,

268
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:07,820
right, and then you tilt it and you get this weird kick in another direction right.

269
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,950
That's really the gyroscopic effect because if you

270
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,634
spun it up like this you get momentum vector sticking out.

271
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,764
When you tilt it, you've changed the momentum,

272
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,500
changed momentum is torque.

273
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,754
So that's actually going to spin you about this other orthogonal axes.

274
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,955
Right. That's what we're taking advantage of.

275
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,554
So these should be spinning at a,

276
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:26,990
you know 5000 10000 RPM.

277
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,330
Some of the smaller ones are going way more than 10000 even,

278
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,839
it's a very high need to be very very balanced very carefully designed.

279
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,495
Immediately, that means more money for one of these devices.

280
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:40,375
But you have a motor that gets you to that speed and then holds it roughly at that speed.

281
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,470
But then there's a second motor here that's

282
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,879
the new part that allows that spinning wheel now to be Gimbaled.

283
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,745
That's what they call the gimbaling angle.

284
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,991
How much and as you Gimbel it if this is your spin axis of the wheel,

285
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,121
as we Gimbel about this,

286
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,125
you know you're changing the spin axis now relative to the body.

287
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,399
So when we do these derivatives there will be body relative derivatives in CMG.

288
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,065
All right. For a reaction wheel, those are not there.

289
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:11,419
So the big benefit here too and you'll see in the mathematics is actually the

290
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,934
torque amplification small input torques

291
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,519
allow you to get a large torque back on the thing.

292
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,730
So that small input really what you're taking advantage of is

293
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,139
the gyroscopic that happens so the faster the wheel is spinning.

294
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,059
The bigger the gyroscopic will be for that input and

295
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,325
you can put in one penny and get a dollar out of it so to speak, you know.

296
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:34,870
And that's why it's great if you have huge things to move, very big satellites.

297
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,220
It might take huge reaction wheels to move them but you

298
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,695
can do it way better with a CMG device

299
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,470
or at the space station it actually uses

300
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,340
double gimballed CMG clusters to kind of hold their attitude and do stuff.

301
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,220
And double gimballing has some benefits,

302
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,529
momentum absorption capability but most

303
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,944
of the devices you see are like this single gimballed,

304
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,924
they have a single axis not a double,

305
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,309
you know, gyrating axis.

306
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,200
That makes it even more complicated.

307
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,184
So drawbacks, definitely mechanically more complex.

308
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,710
Controls are definitely much more complicated.

309
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,539
You will see in the equations of motion and we go from

310
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,850
variable speed CMG to our classic CMG and

311
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,379
a classic CMG just holds the wheel speed

312
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,634
constant versus variable allows you to go all over the place.

313
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,820
It doesn't simplify it much.

314
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,970
It's still really complicated to just just really complicated.

315
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,039
You know, the good down to reaction wheels it becomes actually quite doable.

316
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,261
So the mathematics is def,

317
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:27,184
it's trickier, singularities we're mentioning.

318
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:30,580
You're getting a Torque that's orthogonal to this axis and

319
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,100
the spin axis and so that third axis actually varies with time.

320
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,559
So depending on what you're doing you can get these things to

321
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,245
line up in a plane which is a singularity you're talking about.

322
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:44,945
And if it controls as I need a torque out of that plane you just can't produce that.

323
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,024
And that's the gimble lock,

324
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,554
kind of a consideration.

325
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,970
So we'll see hints of that in the mathematics that come up some singularities.

326
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,649
So good how did they look. They're not.

327
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,159
You don't typically fly one device so you have clusters of CMG's,

328
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,009
often four with clusters of four.

329
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,889
The nice thing is you can.... Each wheel has momentum.

330
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,259
Each wheel is spinning let's say 10000 RPM,

331
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,320
that's an easy number and you can align them in such a way that two wheels are

332
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,100
pointing out so the outward parts cancel the upwards part add up.

333
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,174
The other two wheels are pointing downwards in the other direction where

334
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:19,225
the total momentum of the fourth CMG cluster is zero normally,

335
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:23,159
And that's nice because having zero momentum means I stay agile.

336
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,426
The momentum I have like we saw with the dual spinners,

337
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,509
you get very very stable but it also means you

338
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,610
become more lethargic it takes a huge effort to

339
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,169
drag all that momentum through space that takes a huge torque to do that.

340
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,014
So people like this for agility purposes.

341
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:41,054
You can do the same with reaction wheels but you need more than three.

342
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,532
You can do it with four reaction wheels,

343
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,500
tetrahedron configurations where you can set up

344
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,414
a system that has a nominal zero momentum device.

345
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:51,529
So again so there's whole lectures we can do on how to configure these things.

346
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,150
But that's kind of what they look like in clusters.

347
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,549
We'll typically in class,

348
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,669
you'll see my pictures being mimics of this one,

349
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:00,289
the pyramid CMG cluster.

350
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,970
Also popular configuration for reaction wheels.
