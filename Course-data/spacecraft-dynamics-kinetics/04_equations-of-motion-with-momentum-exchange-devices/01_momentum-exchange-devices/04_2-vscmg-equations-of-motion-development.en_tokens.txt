okay
,
so
we
've
done
a
review
of
what
these
devices
are
.
there
are
certain
benefits
,
everything
has
drawbacks
,
now
we
need
to
get
into
the
math
of
it
.
how
do
we
get
the
equations
of
motion
of
these
things
?
so
we
're
going
to
be
stepping
through
this
carefully
.
we
are
going
to
do
it
for
spacecraft
with
a
single
vscmg
.
so
that
's
a
single
variable-speed
control-moment
gyroscope
.
that
's
a
single
axis
control-moment
gyroscope
.
there
have
been
a
few
that
have
flown
this
way
.
yes
,
jordan
?
>
>
sorry
,
going
back
really
quick
to
the
cmgs
,
do
you
know
if
there
are
any
that
use
like
flux
spinning
to
do
like
,
so
that
could
just
levitate
the
bearing
and
rotate
them
?
>
>
there
are
,
yeah
.
because
,
especially
,
well
,
with
the
variable
speed
,
the
air
force
had
a
nice
program
,
fred
levy
was
running
that
,
to
look
at
energy
storage
,
because
as
you
spin
up
this
wheels
,
as
you
de-spin
them
,
you
can
actually
pull
and
you
could
turn
mechanical
energy
in
the
dimo
effect
.
you
can
turn
into
electrical
energy
,
so
this
could
replace
a
battery
.
but
you
have
to
spin
to
pretty
high
speeds
to
make
them
efficient
.
so
they
're
looking
at
30
,
40,000
rpm
's
,
really
fast
and
mechanically
with
worrying
about
friction
and
little
imbalances
is
quite
tricky
.
so
there
's
some
that
are
looking
at
magnetic
bearings
,
levitation
,
and
those
kind
of
things
.
not
necessarily
flux
pinning
,
i
have
n't
heard
that
one
being
used
but
,
magnetic
bearings
,
absolutely
,
you
will
find
some
of
those
devices
looking
at
that
.
yep
,
so
there
's
a
lot
of
mechanical
challenges
and
how
to
do
this
well
,
robust
,
it
survives
launch
,
where
you
get
shaken
to
death
,
almost
hopefully
,
not
slight
.
so
anyway
,
so
think
of
vscmg
as
a
hybrid
,
we
'll
have
the
math
for
the
cmg
and
for
the
reaction
wheel
all
embedded
in
one
.
so
we
can
talk
to
this
once
.
i
want
you
to
understand
this
path
,
deal
the
parts
of
just
specialties
of
it
,
that
's
going
to
be
our
goal
.
so
goes
with
time
,
to
wrap
this
up
.
so
very
convenient
because
we
can
run
both
but
,
this
vscmg
's
are
devices
being
researched
and
done
actually
phoned
some
small
sats
via
cmg
and
tested
those
as
well
already
.
so
this
is
not
just
theoretical
,
this
is
starting
to
happen
.
but
this
is
stuff
i
did
way
back
for
my
phd
,
it
's
one
of
my
chapters
in
the
phd
.
so
we
're
going
to
try
and
look
at
this
.
one
of
the
niceties
i
'm
going
to
highlight
is
we
talked
about
cmgs
having
singularities
.
what
we
'll
find
is
vscmg
actually
avoids
this
by
move
,
by
changing
the
wheel
speeds
,
i
can
actually
produce
torques
about
axis
or
to
the
tork
direction
.
and
that
can
be
useful
,
it
's
highly
redundant
,
each
device
if
it
's
a
variable
speed
you
could
use
it
as
a
reaction
wheel
,
and
as
a
cmg
.
so
that
's
two
control
modes
that
are
for
devices
that
gives
you
eight
control
modes
,
and
it
's
still
a
three
degree
problem
.
so
you
've
got
a
lot
of
redundancy
built
in
which
is
sometimes
nice
,
and
also
combine
power
energy
storage
,
something
we
just
discussed
.
that
's
something
people
have
been
researching
and
looking
at
and
would
be
nice
,
that
we
did
n't
need
batteries
as
much
.
so
how
do
we
get
equations
of
motion
?
it
all
basically
boils
down
to
this
one
little
,
simple
equation
,
all
right
?
how
hard
could
that
be
?
it
's
kind
of
like
,
hey
you
're
doing
your
whole
dissertation
f=ma
,
that
's
it
.
right
,
if
you
're
doing
orbits
,
trajectories
,
unstable
manifolds
.
all
you
're
doing
,
and
daniel
's
laughing
,
that
's
really
that
's
all
you
're
doing
is
f=ma
,
right
?
how
hard
is
that
,
in
attitude
it
's
h.equal
to
l
how
hard
can
that
be
?
and
i
'll
show
you
here
this
is
the
hint
of
that
.
if
you
want
some
more
fun
go
chat
with
cody
and
john
from
my
lab
,
they
've
been
doing
these
imbalanced
vscmg
equations
that
are
quite
interesting
.
so
let
's
review
this
,
what
is
h.equal
to
l
?
what
is
l
here
?
start
in
the
right
hand
side
,

?
if
this
is
a
dynamical
system
,
this
applied
to
blobs
in
space
,
jello
flying
through
space
.
but
it
was
the
net
external
torque
acting
on
this
dynamical
system
.
now
we
do
n't
have
blobs
but
we
will
have
systems
of
rotating
,
it
's
a
multi-rigid
body
problem
essentially
that
we
're
solving
here
.
so
that
's
just
the
net
external
torques
.
we
do
n't
need
motor
torques
.
whatever
that
reactional
spin
torque
is
does
n't
appear
here
,
because
that
's
an
internal
torque
.
the
gimbal
access
motor
torque
does
not
appear
here
it
's
also
an
internal
torque
.
so
just
the
externals
,
gravity
gradients
,
solar
radiation
pressure
drag
,
maybe
you
have
thrusters
to
augment
this
.
because
maybe
for
momentum
dumping
people
still
use
thrusters
sometimes
,
that
could
be
good
.
now
what
is
the
h
on
the
left
hand
side
?

total
angular

,
right
?
all
of
this
dynamic
assistance
.
so
if
it
's
a
blob
,
it
's
just
the
entire
thing
,
it
's
not
quite
a
blob
here
.
for
us
it
's
a
spacecraft
,
plus
the
wheels
,
plus
the
frame
whatever
holds
these
things
together
.
everything
that
has
momentum
,
angular
momentum
,
we
have
to
account
for
.
and
then
what
's
this
baud
up
here
,
what
type
of
time
derivative
are
we
taking
?
and
as
you
know
we
often
for
good
reason
do
things
in
a
body
frame
,
but
transport
theorem
is
going
to
be
all
over
this
.
we
have
to
do
that
,
right
?
we
're
also
about
which
point
have
we
taken
torks
in
momentum
here
?
center
of
mass
,
actually
.
so
this
either
has
to
be
a
center
of
mass
point
or
taking
moments
and
torques
about
an
inertial
point
.
then
h
equal
to
l
is
true
.
if
you
're
talking
about
a
body
fix
point
,
that
's
anything
else
than
center
of
mass
,
there
was
extra
turnums
that
have
to
appear
here
.
so
again
these
inbalance
things
makes
things
immediately
much
more
complicated
.
so
h
equal
to
l.
we
can
assume
this
is
all
about
the
center
of
mass
of
this
system
.
all
the
wheels
are
balanced
so
even
when
i
'm
trying
gyrating
i
'm
not
really
changing
.
when
i
'm
putting
the
gimballing
angles
in
i
'm
not
changing
the
center
of
mass
of
that
cmg
configuration
,
i
'm
just
changing
where
the
axis
is
pointing
.
i
'm
changing
the
inertias
but
not
center
of
mass
,
so
that
makes
huge
simplifications
.
so
we
need
some
frames
to
define
this
stuff
,
and
i
've
got
this
gimbal
frame
.
so
you
will
have
gs
is
my
spin
axis
,
so
this
is
your
wheel
,
if
it
's
just
the
reaction
wheel
this
is
all
you
would
have
.
a
reaction
wheel
in
a
gimbling
frame
,
this
is
how
we
can
twist
that
spinning
wheel
,
gg
is
the
gimble
axis
,
and
that
other
.
and
the
cmg
devices
solves
a
pancake
with
the
motor
knob
sticking
out
left
and
right
,
it
's
actually
the
gg
axis
.
and
so
gs
is
the
spin
axis
,
gimble
axis
,
and
then
gt
is
at
the
transverse
axis
,
it
's
the
third
axis
that
can
not
complete
a
full
frame
.
gs
crossed
to
gt
gives
you
plus
gg
,
okay
?
so
that
's
what
these
are
,
we
've
defined
them
.
big
omega
here
is
going
to
be
the
wheel
speed
and
we
're
treating
it
here
as
time
varying
.
later
on
we
can
freeze
it
to
make
it
a
cmg
device
,
not
a
variable
speed
cmg
.
gimbel
angles
are
defined
through
gamma
,
so
the
gimbel
rate
at
which
i
am
twisting
these
things
is
gamma
dot
,
and
that
's
what
that
's
defined
.
so
that
's
the
rotation
rate
about
this
gg
axis
,
so
kinematics
is
going
to
come
back
in
.
and
then
so
the
full
frame
is
gs
,
gt
,
gd
,
that
's
the
g
frame
that
we
have
.
this
is
the
one
we
'll
use
a
lot
.
so
let
's
talk
about
angle
velocities
,
the
angular
velocity
of
the
gimbal
frame
relative
to
the
body
.
this
is
where
we
attach
this
device
to
a
body
,
because
the
motor
is
taking
it
and
it
's
twisting
it
left
and
right
,
right
?
and
so
this
is
the
twist
rate
and
the
axis
about
which
you
're
twisting
is
gg
.
so
the
angular
velocity
of
the
g
frame
relative
to
the
b
frame
is
just
going
to
be
gamma
times
gg
.
it
's
the
classic
kinematics
we
did
in
the
first
part
of
the
class
.
there
's
a
wheelframe
,
i
'm
going
to
introduce
this
quickly
,
and
then
within
a
few
steps
,
we
're
going
to
ignore
it
again
.
we
'll
make
some
arguments
why
we
can
ignore
it
.
so
the
wheelframe
needs
three
axis
.
i
'm
picking
principal
axis
,
so
the
spin
axis
,
ds
,
i
can
reuse
it
just
to
be
lazy
.
that
's
my
first
one
and
then
i
have
a
wt
and
a
wg
which
are
two
axis
that
are
fixed
relative
to
the
wheel
,
so
as
the
wheel
rotates
,
these
axis
are
going
to
rotate
with
the
wheel
,
right
?
so
if
you
look
at
the
wheel
frame
,
you
can
go
ahead
and
get
the
angular
velocity
of
the
wheel
system
relative
to
the
gimbal
frame
,
and
that
's
simply
going
to
be
the
wheel
's
spin
rate
times
the
wheel
spin
axis
,
that
's
it
.
so
if
you
sat
on
the
wheel
frame
it
's
set
all
this
gimbal
frame
,
look
at
the
wheel
you
would
see
the
wheel
's
spinning
about
that
axis
at
that
rate
and
vice
versa
.
so
now
we
have
our
two
.
if
you
need
omega
of
w
,
relative
to
b
,
you
would
just
add
up
the
two
of
course
,
and
that
's
how
,
so
we
can
get
any
combinations
of
omegas
that
we
need
.
let
's
talk
about
inertias
.
i
'm
assuming
this
thing
is
built
in
a
way
such
that
i
have
three
principal
inertias
of
this
gimbal
contraption
and
they
'd
line
up
with
the
gs
,
gt
,
gt
frame
.
recently
good
assumption
,
may
not
be
perfect
but
it
's
a
good
simplifying
in
the
analysis
that
we
're
doing
right
now
.
so
i
have
igs
,
igg
,
gt
and
igg
.
so
ig
is
the
inertia
's
of
the
gimbal
frame
along
the
st
and
g
axis
.
that
's
where
the
subscripts
are
coming
from
.
for
the
wheel
,
we
can
write
that
in
the
wheel
frame
,
you
're
going
to
have
an
inertia
about
here
so
that
's
going
to
be
the
wheel
inertia
about
the
s
axis
.
and
then
i
have
iwt
,
because
the
wheel
is
perfectly
symmetric
,
right
?
no
imbalances
,
no
other
warping
,
all
these
kind
of
stuff
.
it
's
going
to
be
the
same
inertia
about
the
any
two
orthogonal
axis
in
the
plane
of
the
disc
,
of
the
wheel
,
right
?
so
i
just
have
iwt
,
iwt
.
now
,
here
i
'm
saying
the
wheel
inertia
in
the
gimbal
frame
,
is
actually
going
to
be
the
same
as
wheel
inertia
expressed
in
the
wheel
frame
.
why
does
that
happen
?
i
think
this
is
really
,
that
's
an
inertial
tensor
.
this
is
a
matrix
representation
of
the
inertial
tensor
,
where
i
picked
the
w
frame
.
here
i
'm
claiming
if
i
picked
the
w
frame
or
the
g
frame
,
they
both
give
you
the
same
answer
.
why
do
you
think
that
is
?
>
>
there
's
a
degenerate
eigenvalue
in
the
w
inertia
.
>
>
you
're
getting
mathematical
.
no
,
but
you
're
right
.
there
is
a
repeated
eigenvalue
in
here
.
that
means
that
these
axes
are
actually
,
the
eigenaxes
that
generates
these
inertias
are
not
unique
.
if
we
go
back
and
look
at
that
.
we
talked
about
eigenvalue
of
an
axis
symmetric
body
.
where
we
had
is
and
it
in
some
of
the
torque
free
motion
of
an
axis
symmetric
body
,
all
of
that
stuff
.
so
you
do
n't
have
to
pick
.
i
could
really
,
to
get
this
diagonal
from
i
just
have
to
pick
this
axis
and
i
have
to
pick
any
two
axis
that
are
orthogonal
to
gs
will
do
.
if
any
two
axis
will
do
,
i
can
always
pick
gt
and
gg
if
you
wanted
to
,
and
they
'll
give
you
the
same
answer
.
so
actually
i
wrote
up
a
quick
mathematical
thing
.
so
really
i
'm
going
to
evaluate
this
now
,
i
'm
pulling
in
library
.
i
'm
going
to
define
now
here
this
as
a
diagonal
matrix
in
this
case
the
g
frame
,
i
've
got
this
.
now
,
since
gs
is
my
first
axis
,
i
'm
doing
what
we
call
m1
basically
that
was
the
one
axis
rotation
that
we
needed
with
an
angle
.
so
,
you
'd
have
1
,
0
,
0
or
i
can
do
metrics
form
of
wg
,
right
?
so
that
's
the
classic
note
,
that
's
the
rotation
because
we
're
doing
one
axis
rotation
where
the
gs
is
the
first
axis
.
so
if
i
translate
here
from
the
gimbal
frame
to
the
wheel
frame
,
this
is
what
i
could
do
,
i
get
this
answer
and
then
you
can
identify
what
does
this
cosine
squared
the
same
thing
sine
squared
.
those
things
are
just
going
to
drop
out
to
b1
,
and
after
all
this
math
you
get
nothing
but
exactly
the
same
result
again
even
though
we
did
this
code
of
transformation
.
so
if
you
do
n't
believe
the
geometric
arguments
,
you
can
quickly
do
the
math
and
validate
and
go
,
yeah
.
actually
,
this
inertia
tensor
is
diagonally
both
in
the
w
frame
and
in
the
g
frame
,
that
's
all
we
need
,
because
that
saves
us
a
lot
of
transpose
without
then
end
up
all
you
're
doing
is
creating
a
lot
of
trigs
that
become
one
in
the
end
and
not
needed
.
good
,
so
that
's
kind
of
helps
explain
that
one
last
slide
.
now
i
need
to
get
some
corner
frames
and
attitudes
.
we
have
the
body
attitude
,
we
know
how
to
describe
that
already
,
mrp
's
,
dcm
,
cortanians
whatever
you
want
to
wish
.
we
need
to
get
the
attitude
of
the
gimball
frame
relative
to
the
body
frame
.
and
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
how
we
defined
dcm
's
,
right
?
it
was
basically
the
mapping
from
n
to
b
and
i
'm
just
going
to
write
that
one
out
.
if
your
recall
bn
ended
up
being
n1
,
n2
,
n3
in
b
frame
components
,
that
was
one
way
to
write
it
or
each
row
,
was
the
b1
,
2
and
3
in
n
frame
components
.
so
if
we
go
back
and
look
at
those
definitions
,
if
you
have
the
three
axis
,
you
can
actually
construct
the
dcn
very
quickly
.
and
in
fact
here
,
i
'm
using
this
one
,
so
instead
of
having
,
what
do
i
have
here
?
let
me
go
back
.
here
we
have
bg
instead
of
bm
.
so
instead
of
n1
,
2
,
3
,
i
have
the
g
first
,
second
and
third
axis
i
put
in
.
and
then
the
b
frame
component
which
is
how
we
define
them
and
that
's
give
you
to
dcm
.
so
that
works
.
so
if
we
have
bg
.
now
if
i
need
to
get
the
inertia
tensor
which
was
diagonal
in
the
g
frame
which
is
great
.
but
i
typically
will
need
it
in
the
end
in
the
body
frame
,
we
'll
do
a
lot
of
body
frame
relative
derivatives
,
i
would
have
to
reimposed
multiply
with
the
dcm
,
right
?
to
map
it
from
one
frame
into
another
frame
and
you
can
do
that
.
the
mathematics
here
become
quite
simple
,
ig
is
a
diagonal
and
this
one
i
can
write
out
like
this
.
so
,
let
's
just
kind
of
do
this
by
hand
once
.
so
,
if
i
have
bg
is
equal
to
my
first
vector
,
my
second
,
my
third
,
and
then
i
need
to
compute
bg
times
i
in
g
frame
components
times
b
,
now
g
transpose
,
right
?
that
would
give
me
ig
and
the
body
frame
.
now
,
if
you
write
it
in
the
matrix
form
like
this
,
it
's
going
to
be
nothing
but
gs
,
gt
,
gg
that
's
the
bg
times
this
diagonal
which
was
igs
0
,
0
,
0
igt
,
0
,
0
,
0
igg
times
the
same
matrix
transposed
.
so
,
this
transpose
becomes
gs
transposed
,
gt
transposed
gg
transposed
,
right
?
and
now
you
can
just
start
to
carry
out
all
this
matrix
math
here
.
if
you
look
at
the
second
part
,
this
is
going
to
be
igs
times
gs
.
you
can
think
of
this
like
a
vectrix
,
matrix
of
vectors
that
we
talked
about
earlier
.
so
out
of
this
,
all
you
'll
going
to
get
is
igs
times
gs
hat
transpose
igt
,
the
second
row
,
0
times
this
,
0
time
this
,
drops
out
,
gt
transpose
plus
igg
,
gg
transpose
.
so
that
's
that
part
times
this
,
so
,
[
laugh
]
gs
's
,
let
's
see
.
actually
that
's
not
right
,
hold
on
.
this
is
not
a
single
line
.
this
is
a
three
by
three
times
a
three
by
one
.
this
is
not
plus
,
that
's
wrong
.
this
would
have
to
go
here
,
and
this
goes
here
.
this
should
be
a
three
by
one
.
it
's
a
three
by
three
times
a
three
by
one
.
that
should
be
a
three
by
one
,
one
by
three
times
three
by
one
.
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
gs
times
this
term
,
gt
times
that
term
,
gg
times
this
term
,
and
that
's
where
you
get
the
final
answer
.
so
from
here
,
if
i
go
backwards
,
igs
,
gs
,
gs
transpose
plus
these
other
terms
.
that
's
all
we
're
doing
.
so
it
's
a
nice
analytic
way
that
we
can
do
these
projections
from
the
inertia
of
one
frame
to
another
.
and
you
will
see
this
is
a
handy
result
to
what
we
'll
use
several
times
as
we
go
through
that
.
so
that
's
what
was
done
here
.
this
one
also
in
the
gimbal
frame
,
i
can
just
do
the
same
thing
,
but
instead
of
igs
,
igt
,
i
have
iws
,
iwt
and
that
's
it
.
it
's
a
little
bookkeeping
.
so
you
get
exactly
the
same
result
.
so
now
we
have
the
inertia
's
written
in
two
different
frames
.
good
,
next
step
,
angular
momentum
.
you
guys
said
h
had
to
be
the
angular
momentum
of
the
total
system
.
the
system
will
be
composed
of
a
single
vscmg
,
so
it
's
a
spacecraft
,
that
's
part
b
,
that
's
the
body
.
then
i
have
g
that
denotes
the
inertia
and
momentum
of
the
gimbal
frame
that
has
some
mass
and
it
rotates
and
does
stuff
.
and
then
you
have
hw
which
is
the
momentum
of
just
the
wheel
itself
spinning
about
that
.
so
we
have
to
add
up
all
these
momentums
.
and
each
one
of
these
momentums
is
of
these
bodies
relative
to
the
inertial
frame
.
so
for
the
body
this
is
dead
simple
,
you
've
done
this
.
i
'm
using
is
now
,
that
is
my
inertia
tensor
of
the
spacecraft
.
you
'll
see
a
different
i
appearing
later
on
.
so
this
one
right
now
is
just
of
the
spacecraft
itself
.
it
has
the
center
of
mass
of
the
reaction
wheel
,
cng
devices
already
accounted
for
in
that
.
but
what
we
're
not
doing
is
the
momentum
of
the
wheel-disk
part
spinning
about
the
center
of
mass
of
those
disks
.
so
a
lot
of
it
is
already
lumped
in
there
.
and
this
part
will
be
easy
to
go
forth
.
the
other
ones
get
more
complicated
.
so
for
the
gimbal
frame
,
it
's
the
same
math
at
the
first
step
.
we
have
ig
times
,
now
i
need
omega
g
relative
to
n
and
omega
g
relative
to
n
is
omega
g
relative
to
b
plus
b
relative
to
n
,
right
.
earlier
we
kept
calling
this
just
omega
,
here
and
being
a
little
explicit
because
we
've
got
lots
of
different
frames
and
lots
of
different
omegas
.
so
it
's
a
little
bit
easier
to
keep
track
of
.
so
we
need
both
.
this
one
was
simply
gamma
dot
times
gg
and
that
's
put
in
here
.
and
the
other
one
is
omega
bn
.
the
inertia
one
i
've
written
with
this
projections
into
g
frame
components
already
.
so
,
ig
times
omega
bn
gives
me
this
answer
,
and
ig
times
this
one
will
give
me
this
answer
.
now
,
again
,
i
'm
jumping
through
a
few
steps
directly
.
so
let
me
just
look
at
it
once
.
this
is
a
tricky
one
to
do
yourself
in
the
homework
and
different
ways
to
solve
this
.
one
thing
you
could
say
is
,
you
know
you
have
ig
like
this
,
and
omega
g
relative
to
b
is
just
gamma
dot
times
gg
.
well
gg
times
gg
here
transposed
just
gives
you
1.
that
's
good
.
gg
times
gt
transposed
,
what
's
that
going
to
happen
?
the
dot
product
between
gt
and
gg
.
zero
,
they
're
orthogonal
,
right
?
so
that
drops
out
.
and
same
thing
with
the
gg
times
gs
.
they
're
also
orthogonal
,
they
drop
out
.
so
that
's
one
way
to
do
it
.
i
think
on
the
next
slide
i
show
you
another
way
with
the
matrix
method
.
that
will
give
you
the
same
answer
hopefully
.
it
's
the
same
physics
.
now
these
terms
,
gs
transposed
with
omega
bn
will
happen
a
lot
.
if
you
look
at
,
if
we
were
showing
the
definition
,
let
us
recall
how
we
typically
write
omega
.
so
omega
bn
,
we
typically
write
it
as
omega
1b1
+
omega
2b2
+
omega
3b3
.
so
we
have
a
reframe
,
the
omega
1
,
2
,
3s
are
nothing
but
the
1
,
2
and
3
access
components
.
omega
1
is
really
defined
as
b1
dotted
with
omega
bn
,
or
in
matrix
form
this
is
equivalent
to
b1
transpose
omega
bn
,
all
right
?
now
,
here
we
do
n't
have
b1
dotted
with
omega
,
we
have
gs
dotted
with
omega
.
so
if
you
have
omega
bn
,
gs
hat
,
this
is
really
what
is
going
to
give
you
,
if
you
think
of
this
,
if
this
is
your
omega
vector
.
and
here
is
your
gs
vector
.
it
's
giving
you
the
gs
component
of
that
omega
vector
essentially
.
and
we
're
just
going
to
call
that
,
instead
of
omega
1
,
2
,
3
,
we
've
already
used
1
,
2
,
3
for
the
body
frame
stuff
.
so
i
ca
n't
reuse
the
same
names
,
i
'm
just
going
to
use
omegas
,
omegat
and
omegag
for
the
gs
,
gt
,
gg
axis
of
that
stuff
.
so
a
slight
notational
thing
but
it
helps
us
.
so
that
's
what
you
see
defined
right
here
.
where
we
have
omega
s
is
gs
hat
transpose
with
omega
.
omega
t
is
gt
transpose
with
omega
and
gg
is
the
projection
of
g
onto
omega
.
so
the
omega
vector
,
this
is
again
without
any
subscripts
,
we
imply
it
's
omega
bn
.
at
some
point
it
just
gets
old
to
write
all
that
stuff
over
and
over
again
.
so
this
is
omega
bn
is
equal
to
these
three
vector
components
of
that
along
the
g
axis
.
so
if
you
use
that
definition
then
you
have
here
gs
transpose
times
omega
and
that
becomes
nothing
but
this
little
omega
s.
so
,
the
same
momentum
expression
here
can
be
rewritten
a
little
bit
more
compactly
in
this
form
and
that
will
help
us
in
same
label
keeping
that
we
do
.
so
,
now
we
have
to
angular
momentum
vector
off
the
g
frame
relative
to
the
inertial
frame
.
what
we
need
next
is
the
angular
momentum
of
the
wheel
.
>
>
[
inaudible
]
>
>
itself
.
then
it
's
the
same
formula
.
you
need
the
angular
velocity
of
the
wheel
relative
to
inertial
,
and
we
know
the
angular
velocity
of
the
wheel
relative
to
gimbal
.
that
was
big
omega
times
gs
.
that
was
the
spin
axis
side
.
gimbal
relative
to
body
,
that
was
the
gamma
dot
times
gg
,
that
's
the
gimbaling
rate
.
and
then
of
course
,
this
is
the
classic
spacecraft
body
rate
that
you
'd
have
.
if
you
plug
that
in
you
now
have
three
of
these
terms
to
evaluate
.
and
i
will
just
to
show
you
different
ways
to
do
it
,
i
'll
do
it
different
ways
here
.
this
first
term
i
've
written
out
,
and
it
's
going
to
be
this
inertia
tensor
which
we
rewrote
earlier
as
a
result
of
the
principal
inertias
times
these
outer
products
times
omega
.
and
in
here
quickly
you
can
see
again
gs
hat
transposed
omega
.
that
's
what
we
defined
to
be
omega
s.
the
projection
of
the
gs
axis
onto
omega
was
the
omega
s
component
.
same
thing
with
omega
t
and
omega
g.
so
that
's
one
way
we
can
get
that
first
term
.
that
gives
us
this
one
.
now
we
want
to
get
the
other
two
.
i
'm
showing
you
a
matrix
representation
,
for
some
people
this
might
be
a
easier
way
to
think
.
both
of
them
should
all
give
you
the
same
stuff
.
this
term
i
can
write
in
g
frame
components
as
this
diagonal
matrix
.
g
relative
to
b
,
that
was
gamma
dot
times
gg
.
so
,
in
g
frame
component
it
's
00
gamma
dot
,
all
right
?
and
then
you
just
do
your
typical
matrix
math
with
which
will
give
you
00
iwt
that
along
the
third
axis
,
as
the
vector
representation
of
that
.
that
's
the
third
axis
is
gg
,
so
you
always
get
back
the
same
answer
.
you
could
do
the
same
thing
also
for
this
one
,
just
here
omega
w
relative
to
g
was
big
omega
times
gs
,
so
it
's
big
omega
along
the
first
axis
of
the
wheel
frame
.
this
inertia
tensor
in
the
wheel
frame
.
you
carry
out
the
matrix
math
,
you
get
just
something
in
the
first
axis
,
which
is
the
gs
representation
.
so
,
this
ties
back
to
the
,
you
know
,
week
one
stuff
that
we
did
.
vector
matrix
representation
.
you
should
be
able
to
go
back
and
forth
and
whatever
's
most
convenient
it
'll
get
you
there
,
it
should
be
the
same
answer
.
now
,
we
have
these
,
we
add
them
up
to
the
other
term
,
you
combine
them
,
this
gives
us
now
the
angular
momentum
of
the
wheel
that
we
need
.
okay
,
great
.
a
few
more
things
,
as
we
take
derivatives
,
we
'll
want
inertial
derivatives
and
,
of
course
,
we
'll
use
transport
theorems
because
a
lot
of
these
inertia
tensors
are
fixed
by
the
body
frame
.
and
also
some
of
these
other
axis
have
benefits
.
so
,
the
gs
,
gt
,
gg
axis
you
could
write
analytically
if
you
know
their
orientation
at
launch
.
i
locked
them
down
and
gs
was
pointing
here
and
gt
was
pointing
here
,
and
there
's
no
gimble
angle
,
right
?
and
after
launch
,
you
rotated
15
degrees
,
you
can
actually
compute
with
your
classic
cosines
and
sines
.
what
are
the
current
orientations
of
those
axes
?
gg
stays
always
the
same
,
hopefully
,
that
means
you
bolted
it
down
correctly
,
all
right
?
the
gimbal
axis
is
supposed
to
stay
body
fixed
,
always
.
but
for
a
vscmg
,
the
gsgt
,
we
have
to
treat
generally
as
time
varying
.
so
,
you
can
write
this
and
in
code
in
fact
,
it
would
simulate
this
.
if
i
know
my
gimbal
angle
i
ca
n't
compute
at
any
instant
.
if
i
know
my
initial
orientations
at
launch
what
are
my
current
orientations
of
this
frame
of
the
wheel
?
how
far
has
it
twisted
?
all
right
,
so
we
will
need
derivatives
of
this
stuff
.
if
we
take
body
frame
derivatives
,
different
ways
you
can
do
it
.
if
you
want
to
,
you
could
just
use
this
expression
here
and
take
derivatives
.
because
these
are
actually
fixed
as
seen
by
the
body
.
and
cosine
becomes
minus
sine
,
which
is
right
here
.
sine
becomes
cosine
,
and
you
can
see
the
derivative
of
this
is
going
to
be
the
gt
direction
and
vice
versa
.
and
the
derivative
of
this
one
is
just
common
sense
,
is
going
to
be
zero
.
that
's
one
way
.
or
you
can
also
use
a
transport
theorem
and
say
,
well
wait
a
minute
,
instead
of
taking
the
b
frame
,
what
if
i
took
the
g
frame
derivative
of
this
stuff
?
and
if
you
have
the
g
frame
derivative
of
gs
that
is
zero
,
i
see
by
the
frame
itself
these
axes
do
n't
move
.
plus
you
would
need
the
omega
g
relative
to
b
,
which
is
gamma
delta
gg
,
crossed
with
this
axis
,
you
get
a
g
,
a
third
axis
cross
with
gs
,
the
first
axis
which
gives
you
plus
the
second
one
.
you
can
see
the
transport
theorem
,
you
get
the
same
answer
.
different
ways
you
can
approach
it
.
i
like
the
transport
,
it
's
very
compact
,
you
can
get
there
very
,
very
quickly
without
writing
it
out
.
so
,
we
can
get
the
body
frame
derivatives
,
the
key
is
the
third
one
,
that
's
where
it
's
locked
down
.
that
one
does
n't
vary
,
the
other
two
are
a
function
of
the
gimbal
rate
.
if
you
need
inertial
derivatives
,
which
we
can
do
it
here
,
we
've
chosen
to
do
b-frame
derivatives
.
we
've
already
got
these
answers
as
a
sub-result
,
plus
the
omega
crossed
these
axes
again
.
and
you
can
do
that
,
and
carry
out
,
if
you
write
omega
.
the
easy
trick
here
is
to
get
this
answer
in
your
homework
i
would
say
.
write
omega
node
as
omega
1
b1
,
omega
2
b2
because
you
're
crossing
the
gs
.
instead
write
omega
as
omega
s
gs
,
omega
t
gt
,
right
?
use
the
g
frame
components
of
omega
and
those
definitions
and
that
's
where
these
terms
come
in
.
and
then
,
it
's
just
a
classic
cross
products
between
vectors
in
the
same
frame
.
so
,
1
crossed
2
gives
you
3
,
3
crossed
1
give
you
minus
2
,
all
the
usual
rules
.
and
that
's
how
you
can
get
there
then
as
well
.
so
,
that
would
work
.
so
then
,
you
should
derive
this
yourself
then
.
i
'm
just
kind
of
showing
you
the
highlights
and
how
we
go
after
it
.
since
we
have
omega
s
,
omega
t
and
omega
g
,
the
vector
components
of
the
body
rate
in
the
g
frame
components
.
we
will
also
have
derivatives
of
this
.
omega
s
,
omega
t
,
omega
g
are
scalars
.
so
,
what
type
of
derivative
am
i
taking
on
the
left
hand
side
?

just
a
scalar
,
so
that
stuff
comes
back
again
.
if
it
's
just
a
scalar
it
's
just
a
time
derivative
.
over
here
,
tebow
,
what
type
of
derivative
have
i
chosen
to
use
here
?
>
>
an
inertila
derivative
.
>
>
inertial
derivative
.
but
that
was
purely
a
choice
,
i
did
n't
have
to
use
an
inertial
derivative
.
i
could
have
used
any
,
as
long
as
i
'm
consistent
,
you
ca
n't
use
these
derivative
chain
rules
into
one
part
in
a
and
one
part
in
b.
if
you
've
taken
a
,
make
everything
a
,
if
you
've
taken
b
,
make
everything
b.
the
math
will
work
itself
out
.
so
,
you
can
do
that
,
so
that
term
is
just
okay
,
the
angular
acceleration
dotted
in
the
the
gs
direction
,
great
.
this
term
here
,
gs
hat
transposed
omega
.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
gs
hat
is
here
,
so
we
have
all
this
math
times
,
what
did
we
do
,
times
omega
,
gs
hat
transposed
omega
.
so
,
if
you
can
see
here
,
gs
hat
,
this
stuff
,
transposed
omega
,
gt
transposed
with
omega
,
what
does
that
give
me
?
>
>
omega
t.
>
>
omega
t
,
exactly
.
that
was
the
projection
.
gg
transposed
omega
gives
you
omega
g.
and
you
're
going
to
have
an
omega
g
,
omega
t
with
that
product
and
here
omega
t
,
omega
g
with
the
product
.
1
plus
,
1
minus
,
they
both
cancel
and
all
you
're
left
with
is
here
times
gt
times
that
term
,
that
second
term
,
which
was
gt
transposed
omega
which
gives
you
omega
t.
let
's
say
we
did
body
frame
.
how
is
that
going
to
look
different
?
let
me
do
that
by
hand
.
so
,
just
so
i
can
prove
,
so
if
we
use
this
formula
,
i
do
n't
need
to
fire
here
,
okay
.
if
we
use
this
formula
as
tebow
says
,
that
's
just
a
time
derivative
.
now
,
let
's
say
,
i
'm
going
to
use
body
frames
.
i
'm
going
to
use
primes
as
a
body
frame
instead
of
writing
ddt
and
b
's
and
all
that
stuff
.
you
would
have
gs
transposed
prime
,
right
,
times
omega
plus
gs
hat
omega
bn
prime
.
well
,
one
thing
,
omega
bn
prime
,
how
does
that
relate
to
the
initial
derivative
?
it
's
the
same
thing
,
right
?
omega
,
the
b
and
the
n
frame
is
the
same
.
so
,
that
's
kind
of
cool
.
we
get
right
away
gs
hat
transposed
omega
bn
dot
,
the
inertial
derivative
.
so
,
that
's
good
.
this
one
,
we
need
the
body
frame
derivative
of
gs
,
and
if
you
go
back
,
we
did
that
actually
and
i
had
showed
you
the
results
.
here
we
go
.
the
body
framed
derivative
of
that
,
different
ways
you
can
derive
it
,
but
i
'll
use
the
transport
theorem
,
was
nothing
but
gamma
dot
gt
.
and
if
i
plug
that
one
in
,
gamma
dot
gt
transposed
omega
bn
,
this
whole
thing
is
nothing
but
the
definition
of
that
and
you
get
the
same
answer
.
so
,
as
expected
,
hopefully
,
we
took
here
,
b
frame
derivatives
,
in
the
slides
i
'm
taking
n
frame
derivatives
,
i
get
the
same
answer
both
ways
.
so
,
that
's
always
a
good
thing
to
practice
then
you
know
you
're
doing
all
your
math
correctly
.
so
,
you
do
this
and
you
apply
this
now
for
all
the
three
axes
and
now
we
have
the
inertial
derivative
that
you
will
need
as
a
sub
result
once
we
start
to
take
h
dot
and
start
grinding
.
so
,
we
have
that
.
one
other
thing
we
'll
use
is
you
will
see
a
lot
in
the
math
,
we
have
ig
plus
iws
appearing
.
and
that
's
the
inertia
of
the
wheel
plus
the
inertia
of
the
gimbal
frame
that
holds
the
wheel
and
twists
.
and
so
,
we
can
sum
them
up
.
if
you
see
js
,
it
's
nothing
,
but
basically
the
inertia
of
the
combined
wheel
gimbal
frame
system
.
so
,
just
a
notational
thing
,
because
there
's
lots
of
stuff
happening
.
and
now
the
fun
,
you
need
to
do
this
yourself
,
i
'm
showing
you
the
highlights
.
[
laugh
]
but
this
is
now
where
you
apply
your
excellent
skills
on
transport
theorem
and
differentiation
,
we
need
h
dot
=
l
,
so
i
would
say
since
we
've
broken
it
up
as
h
of
the
hub
b
h
of
the
gimbal
and
h
of
the
wheel
,
do
each
separately
.
it
just
helps
manage
all
the
algebra
.
otherwise
you
're
bound
to
get
one
letter
crossed
with
another
.
do
one
by
at
the
time
.
so
if
i
take
h
dot
using
the
transport
theorem
.
i
take
the
derivative
as
seen
by
the
gimbal
frame
,
because
i
'm
using
a
lot
of
gimbal
frame
components
.
but
then
i
need
to
add
plus
omega
of
the
gimbal
frame
,
relative
to
the
inertial
,
right
?
because
dot
is
still
the
inertial
derivative
,
cross
with
that
h
expression
,
carry
all
that
algebra
.
this
is
what
you
get
,
i
'll
let
you
do
that
.
you
guys
are
very
good
at
this
now
.
you
do
the
same
thing
for
the
gimbal
stuff
and
this
is
what
you
get
,
the
gimbal
frame
stuff
.
and
then
for
the
body
itself
,
well
that
's
pretty
trivial
,
we
've
done
this
before
for
a
single
rigid
body
,
you
regain
the
same
derivative
expression
,
right
?
now
we
pack
it
together
h
dot
=
l
is
a
sum
of
all
three
.
we
're
going
to
use
this
definition
,
j
was
the
inertia
of
the
gimbal
frame
and
the
wheel
,
the
combined
vscmg
device
.
this
is
the
inertia
of
the
rigid
part
of
the
spacecraft
.
so
this
one
is
actually
constant
,
as
seen
by
the
body
frame
.
this
one
is
n't
,
because
inertia
,
everything
is
spinning
and
twisting
.
and
i
now
is
the
combined
spacecraft
inertia
,
that
's
the
full
thing
.
the
rigid
part
plus
all
these
spinning
,
twisting
wheel
parts
,
all
combined
.
that
means
i
in
this
notation
actually
becomes
time
varying
.
if
you
simulate
these
things
,
every
time
step
,
you
have
to
recompute
where
are
these
axes
,
where
are
these
inertias
and
sum
up
all
these
inertia
contributions
again
.
so
it
becomes
even
as
seen
by
the
body
,
i
is
time
varying
but
is
is
the
rigid
part
.
that
's
what
you
took
advantage
of
when
you
did
the
earlier
differentiation
of
hb
,
that
it
was
fixed
as
seen
by
the
body
frame
.
yes
,
louis
?
>
>
how
do
you
guys
account
for
the
center
of
mass
of
the
gimbal
system
,
in
the
body
or
no
?
>
>
so
all
of
these
things
have
been
taken
in
account
for
.
is
here
actually
already
accounts
for
the
parallel
axis
part
.
that
if
the
cg
of
the
wheels
are
n't
mounted
in
the
center
of
the
spacecraft
,
center
of
mass
of
the
spacecraft
,
but
they
're
offset
somehow
.
that
is
a
fixed
offset
,
and
that
's
already
accounted
for
actually
here
when
we
derive
this
stuff
.
so
here
these
are
just
the
wheel
parts
that
that
's
the
momentum
and
inertia
is
spinning
about
their
own
perspective
center
of
masses
.
so
center
of
mass
is
all
subtlety
.
i
'm
glossing
over
somewhat
,
but
this
is
rigorous
,
this
works
,
it
's
just
you
have
to
account
for
depending
on
where
you
place
them
,
okay
.
there
's
this
much
mass
out
there
,
that
m
distance
squared
term
is
already
put
into
this
part
.
because
that
part
is
fixed
,
relative
,
it
's
a
balanced
wheel
.
if
it
's
inbalanced
,
your
question
would
be
very
good
,
because
then
with
an
imbalance
,
as
i
'm
rotating
,
then
the
center
of
mass
of
the
wheel
is
actually
orbiting
inside
the
craft
and
then
this
would
n't
work
.
you
'd
have
to
be
much
more
careful
about
which
points
you
do
it
so
.
being
balanced
allows
us
to
,
as
complicated
as
it
is
,
and
i
'm
sure
you
'll
agree
in
the
homework
,
being
balanced
makes
this
much
,
much
easier
.
so
that
's
a
key
assumption
,
so
now
we
throw
this
all
together
.
h
dot
=
l
,
and
i
combine
terms
,
which
you
will
do
as
well
,
you
can
come
up
with
these
kind
of
a
terms
.
now
this
is
the
i
inertial
tensor
of
the
hub
,
the
rigid
plus
all
the
spinning
stuff
.
you
can
write
it
out
into
this
form
,
which
is
our
equation
of
motion
of
the
spacecraft
with
a
single
variable
speed
cmg
.
l
is
still
the
net
external
torque
we
were
talking
about
earlier
,
so
that
could
be
your
gravity
gradient
torque
acting
on
this
or
deviation
pressure
,
if
we
have
thrusters
acting
for
generating
pure
torques
.
but
it
's
all
about
the
system
center
of
mass
.
and
then
inside
you
have
all
these
terms
.
so
the
first
thing
i
always
do
is
let
's
make
sure
these
equations
make
sense
if
we
simplify
them
.
if
we
bolt
down
like
on
launch
,
we
have
no
gimbling
,
we
have
no
wheel
acceleration
,
everything
is
locked
down
for
launch
,
i
should
get
back
the
equations
of
motion
of
a
single
rigid
body
,
which
was
this
part
and
this
part
and
the
l.
everything
else
should
vanish
.
so
if
you
look
at
that
and
you
see
,
okay
,
if
i
have
gamma
dot
,
if
i
'm
locked
down
,
there
's
no
gimbling
going
on
.
so
gamma
dot
has
to
be
0.
this
vanishes
,
this
vanishes
,
let
's
see
,
gimbal
acceleration
vanishes
.
that
's
0
and
this
is
0
,
so
no
gimbling
makes
a
lot
of
them
vanish
.
if
you
take
the
remaining
equations
you
've
got
one
here
,
iws
omega
dot
,
and
you
've
got
this
is
all
vanished
,
that
vanished
.
you
got
this
term
that
's
non-zero
,
and
this
term
that
's
non-zero
.
go
back
and
look
at
your
dual
spinner
equations
of
motion
.
there
we
lined
it
up
with
the
real
axis
being
along
b1
or
something
.
so
if
you
make
gsb1
,
you
get
exactly
the
same
equations
again
,
so
that
's
a
nice
validation
.
if
the
wheel
is
locked
down
,
then
big
omega
is
0.
that
means
this
term
vanishes
as
well
,
this
term
vanishes
as
well
,
and
there
's
no
wheel
acceleration
.
so
,
as
expected
,
all
these
terms
vanish
once
you
lock
it
down
,
which
is
always
good
.
now
,
so
this
is
good
for
both
devices
,
but
you
can
see
the
gimbling
adds
a
lot
of
terms
.
there
's
gamma
,
gamma
,
gamma
,
all
the
stuff
that
happens
here
.
what
if
you
have
a
reaction
wheel
mode
,
we
talked
about
that
.
we
basically
get
a
double
spin
equations
of
motion
,
way
simpler
.
what
if
we
make
it
a
classic
cmg
?
in
that
case
,
the
wheel
's
speed
has
to
be
constant
,
not
variable
speed
.
let
's
see
how
much
it
simplifies
then
.
one
term
,
woop-de-doo
.
you
got
all
this
other
stuff
,
so
the
cmgs
really
are
n't
that
much
easier
than
the
variable
speed
cmgs
,
you
just
now
accounted
for
all
the

they
have
,
and
in
fact
every
cmg
is
in
fact
a
variable
speed
cmg
because
it
launches
spun
down
and
they
have
to
slowly
spin
it
up
.
but
what
they
do
is
a
simple
control
that
they
,
it
's
complexity
of
the
stuff
.
here
,
let
me
show
you
what
generates
the
control
that
you
have
.
we
have
body
rates
are
pretty
small
.
i
mean
,
we
're
talking
small
.
people
freak
out
when
this
craft
goes
more
than
two
degrees
per
second
,
that
's
nothing
.
the
wheels
will
be
going
way
,
way
faster
.
so
cmgs
,
we
're
looking
at
10,000
rpm
.
so
the
big
omega
is
going
to
be
the
big
honking
elephant
.
so
this
is
small
,
gimbal
rates
are
small
,
this
stuff
is
all
small
.
what
's
going
to
give
us
the
big
torque
?
it
's
going
to
be
this
term
,
right
here
,
that
's
the
wheel
speed
,
which
is
huge
.
iws
,
which
is
your
biggest
inertia
of
this
disk
because
we
move
the
mass
out
about
the
gs
axis
,
that
give
us
that
ring
,
the
pancake
shape
.
and
gamma
dot
is
directly
proportional
to
that
.
so
,
if
you
hold
the
fixed
wing
speed
,
this
is
the
control
torque
that
we
would
use
in
a
control
application
,
and
that
's
what
they
're
after
.
you
could
make
everything
else
variable
,
but
that
's
really
more
in
a
later
research
,
we
've
been
finding
in
how
we
can
avoid
singularities
.
but
the
trick
is
,
with
the
reaction
wheel
,
what
generates
the
torque
is
this
one
.
i
'll
show
you
the
motor
torque
equation
in
the
next
class
.
but
as
you
accelerate
a
wheel
you
get
,
with
a
minus
sign
,
an
opposite
torque
back
onto
the
craft
.
but
you
only
get
one
newton
meter
in
,
you
get
one
newton
meter
out
.
here
though
,
if
i
gimble
,
with
a
little
effort
,
the
faster
the
wheel
is
going
,
the
bigger
the
torque
i
get
.
and
that
's
what
they
've
been
focusing
on
.
so
,
devices
could
do
this
.
the
issue
is
the
motor
torque
about
the
spin
axis
typically
are
not
that
strong
.
if
you
have
to
muscle
through
a
singularity
acting
like
a
reaction
wheel
,
you
're
simply
going
to
saturate
that
little
motor
very
,
very
quickly
.
so
the
way
they
're
designing
it
,
they
're
doing
the
minimal
effort
required
,
which
means
it
tracks
it
within
a
simple
bound
,
but
it
's
not
very
tight
bound
,
and
it
does
n't
have
much
.
it
may
take
,
it
just
needs
you
to
spin
it
up
and
keep
it
roughly
at
the
same
speed
,
that
's
all
they
need
.
so
it
would
be
a
hardware
change
.
so
some
have
flown
them
like
this
and
actually
demonstrated
that
you
can
do
it
,
it
's
just
a
little
bit
more
complexity
in
the
control
and
people
,
air
force
in
particular
have
been
looking
at
these
form
of
energy
storage
devices
and
to
account
for
them
.
there
's
extra
complexity
,
they
feel
like
i
can
do
it
.
or
some
cmg
manufacturer
who
was
chatting
with
me
during
my
phd
too
,
and
they
're
saying
well
,
we
could
also
take
a
reaction
wheel
off
the
shelf
and
a
cmg
off
the
shelf
,
and
combine
both
devices
to
get
the
same
mathematical
benefits
.
off
the
shelf
is
always
cheaper
than
trying
to
custom
design
specifically
for
something
.
so
until
these
become
common
,
there
's
different
ways
you
can
do
it
.
but
for
here
,
this
is
kind
of
,
where
are
we
going
to
go
?
so
what
we
can
see
,
my
final
comments
on
this
is
,
with
these
equations
of
motion
,
you
see
now
there
that
as
the
wheel
speed
grows
,
we
can
get
a
very
large
torque
.
but
also
there
's
limits
in
each
reaction
wheel
,
how
fast
you
can
spin
it
and
that
's
that
big
omega
dot
.
the
gimbling
is
a
nice
mode
,
but
you
will
also
have
singularities
.
actually
,
i
think
i
could
show
those
as
well
.
this
will
be
something
about
the
gt
axis
,
that
's
one
axis
.
if
i
have
four
devices
,
i
'm
going
to
have
four
gt
axes
.
and
depending
on
how
you
've
lined
it
up
,
you
can
have
all
those
axes
become
coplanar
.
and
if
your
control
is
outside
of
that
,
which
will
happen
commonly
with
external
disturbances
,
that
's
a
gimbal
lock
situation
.
because
these
axis
about
which
i
get
these
nice
generous
torques
vary
with
time
,
it
just
makes
a
lot
of
things
more
complicated
.
but
that
was
the
singularity
that
we
have
so
,
anyway
so
you
can
see
,
cmgs
,
definitely
a
lot
of
benefits
,
the
amplification
but
also
mechanical
challenges
,
more
expensive
.
but
you
get
a
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
,
way
bigger
torques
than
what
you
get
with
a
reaction
wheel
,
but
it
comes
at
a
cost
and
the
controls
get
more
challenging
,
too
.
