so we want to next is actually look motor torque equations 
if we go look this differential equations, 
this is in a vectorial form, 
really if you think in scalar components, 
many differential equations this line, 
this boxed line give 
three 
three 
many states this system 
three 
well, you omegas theres attitude, 
attitude, we differential kinematic equations, right 
so attitude is always covered, 
so lets ignore attitude part 
this differential equation, 
you could solve omegadot 
great is omegadot 
right per wheel, you dont know that angular acceleration is gonna 
is gammadoubledot 
we dont know that either 
so theres two extra degrees freedom in this system 
mechanical device provided one additional degree freedom we 
a singleaxis rotation going body to gimbal, gimbal to wheel 
so this gives you three differential equations 
we need five, thats we one device 
if we five devices, 
i need way more, this kind becomes repetitive 
so we lets say we four vscmgs, 
this is still equation you would use 
you would need this summations devices 
ill show you to that 
we still need whats called motor torque equations per device 
because,ultimately, you would simulate is, hey, 
im putting in one newtonmeter that spin axis 
reaction wheel half a newtonmeter gimbal axis 
whats dynamic response gonna right 
so we need extra equations we dont yet 
so thats gonna look next 
we find motor torque equations 
essentially, we go back to board say, look, 
looking hdot equal to l if you think 
a freebody diagram let draw that 
if we think this a youve got wheel 
right heres spin axis, 
wheel is free to rotate gs 
theres rotation 
omega 
so this axis is a motor i know theres 
a motor torque that makes accelerate this axis 
if you zero voltage motor broke, 
would a freespinning wheel as, 
you know, would spin up, spin 
theres motor torque applied 
this is similar to that inaudible problem you 
cylinder that rotisserie grill architecture 
right bbprime axis 
that axis free to spin 
so if we motor torque, 
this would a freespin axis 
motor torque, you get to control torque is applied right 
so we know this is motor torque acts, 
this is one axis 
you will two axes that orthogonal to this 
spacecraft is tumbling moving remember, 
this axis a particular orientation in 
craft structure to actually produce two torques 
so, we hdot equal to l, 
center mass this wheel now, 
is we kind derived earlier already, 
we use that to relate come a scalar equation that we need 
so thats im showing you here 
so if you this, hdot equal to l 
dynamical system is wheel thing that 
interfaces wheel is motor torque in 
one axis structural torques along two 
thats makes sure this wheel doesnt flip 
sideways relative to gimbal frame, right 
you gimbal it, youre specifying two three dimensions wheel 
spin thats actually free 
so we this, youve derived this already, 
we this result earlier we derived full equations motion, 
so i get to rewrite 
trick is we to recognize here that hdot equal to l, 
that torque thats acting wheel, 
torque thats along gs axis must i call us 
thats spinaxis motor torque 
two im calling tau 
structural torques that keep this wheel aligned relative to that 
if you needed to know structural torques were, 
youre worried breaking hinges bearings stuff, 
you actually go back here simulation then, 
postprocessing, plug in states 
gts 
ggs gonna structural torques that acting system 
so this approach actually gives you internal torques, if you want 
equations motion, i dont need 
so we need to is is along gs axis, 
that must equal 
so here, you see weve got this part 
this part must equal to motor torque, 
thats i find motor torque equation here 
essentially motor torque is wheel inertia times 
angular acceleration plus two terms 
if we ignore gimbaling, 
big is spacecraft acceleration compared to 
wheel acceleration you think 
size 
an order magnitude difference 
two, three orders magnitude difference 
fast spacecraft rotate, you think 
whats a fast speed declare emergencies 
three degrees a second 
two degrees, three degrees, 
a couple degrees per second, doesnt take much 
you know, fast wheel go 
maximum speed, , rpm, way faster 
so accelerations gonna well exceed spacecraft 
so people actually go, 
you know what, this is motor torque equation, 
really makes life simpler decouples this equation 
completely attitude states gimbal states true thing 
momentum wont preserved if you that 
this is full answer that you 
in fact, if youre gimbaling time, 
gimbal rate crosscouple back this torque 
theres a gyroscopic torque that you to account 
so this is full motor torque equation that you 
right so we this extra differential equation we needed 
we earlier one omegadot 
this one, if i throw in, 
i solve this one 
you see also coupled to this one 
so you get linear systems equations you to solve simultaneously 
you could take this ill show you in a moment 
we take this backsubstitute in, 
this will give us 
reaction creations motion that ill show you classic results 
so, different ways you formulate 
so thats one extra differential equation 
we also need gammadoubledot 
that needs motor torque ug 
whats that torque there 
there, dynamical system im using, 
gimbal frame, 
inside gimbal frame is a wheel 
torques im worrying is outside gimbal frame, 
so gimbal frame to body is motor torque is 
attached between gimbal body 
so, inside it, dynamical system is actually 
wheel gyroscopics frame gyroscopics 
so we computed hdots earlier 
if you sum up, this is you get 
now, this stuff gimbal axis actually to equal to motor torque 
two structural torques produced 
so kind a process, right 
two structural 
this is motor torque here thats really spinning 
this combined you rotate frame, 
youre also rotating wheel 
a combined system 
you come up, you solve this in end 
thats you get 
so if you drop this ignore terms, 
you could roughly say that torque is equal to inertia times angular acceleration, 
a pretty crude approximation 
this gives you full coupling 
you see, if you a torque, 
you get angular acceleration gimbal, 
also you get spacecraft angular acceleration coupling 
so, either you backsubstitute you solve a linear system equations 
we actually five differential equations 
given torques acting system, 
we solve everything
