1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:10,080
Okay, so we've done a review
of what these devices are.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,465
There are certain benefits,
everything has drawbacks,

3
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:13,980
now we need to get into the math of it.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,520
How do we get the equations
of motion of these things?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,600
So we're going to be stepping
through this carefully.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,004
We are going to do it for
spacecraft with a single VSCMG.

7
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,350
So that's a single variable-speed
control-moment gyroscope.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,913
That's a single axis
control-moment gyroscope.

9
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:35,660
There have been a few
that have flown this way.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,490
Yes, Jordan?

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,470
>> Sorry,
going back really quick to the CMGs,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,910
do you know if there are any that use
like flux spinning to do like, so

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,210
that could just levitate the bearing and
rotate them?

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,520
>> There are, yeah.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,413
because, especially, well,
with the variable speed,

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,757
the Air Force had a nice program,
Fred Levy was running that,

17
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:57,126
to look at energy storage, because as you
spin up this wheels, as you de-spin them,

18
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:01,403
you can actually pull and you could turn
mechanical energy in the dimo effect.

19
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:04,851
You can turn into electrical energy,
so this could replace a battery.

20
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:07,555
But you have to spin to pretty high
speeds to make them efficient.

21
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:11,270
So they're looking at 30,
40,000 RPM's, really fast and

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,830
mechanically with worrying about friction
and little imbalances is quite tricky.

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,893
So there's some that are looking at
magnetic bearings, levitation, and

24
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:19,827
those kind of things.

25
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:24,065
Not necessarily flux pinning, I haven't
heard that one being used but, magnetic

26
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:28,076
bearings, absolutely, you will find
some of those devices looking at that.

27
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:31,624
Yep, so there's a lot of mechanical
challenges and how to do this well,

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,636
robust, it survives launch, where you
get shaken to death, almost hopefully,

29
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:36,770
not slight.

30
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,310
So anyway, so think of VSCMG as a Hybrid,
we'll have the math for

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,220
the CMG and for
the reaction wheel all embedded in one.

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,670
So we can talk to this once.

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,000
I want you to understand this path,
deal the parts of just specialties of it,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,720
that's going to be our goal.

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,830
So goes with time, to wrap this up.

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,720
So very convenient because
we can run both but,

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,190
this VSCMG's are devices
being researched and

38
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,030
done actually phoned some small sats via
CMG and tested those as well already.

39
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,574
So this is not just theoretical,
this is starting to happen.

40
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:09,070
But this is stuff I did way back for my
PhD, it's one of my chapters in the PhD.

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,030
So we're going to try and look at this.

42
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,790
One of the niceties I'm going to
highlight is we talked about CMGs having

43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,540
singularities.

44
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,201
What we'll find is VSCMG actually avoids
this by move, by changing the wheel

45
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,881
speeds, I can actually produce torques
about axis or to the tork direction.

46
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,559
And that can be useful,
it's highly redundant, each device

47
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,950
if it's a variable speed you could use
it as a reaction wheel, and as a CMG.

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,670
So that's two control modes that are for
devices that gives you

49
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,700
eight control modes, and
it's still a three degree problem.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,570
So you've got a lot of redundancy
built in which is sometimes nice, and

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,000
also combine power energy storage,
something we just discussed.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,970
That's something people have been
researching and looking at and

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,840
would be nice,
that we didn't need batteries as much.

54
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,830
So how do we get equations of motion?

55
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,230
It all basically boils down to this one
little, simple equation, all right?

56
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,970
How hard could that be?

57
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,304
It's kind of like, hey you're doing
your whole dissertation f=ma, that's it.

58
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:11,050
Right, if you're doing orbits,
trajectories, unstable manifolds.

59
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,420
All you're doing, and Daniel's laughing,

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,640
that's really that's all
you're doing is f=ma, right?

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,550
How hard is that, in attitude it's
h.equal to l how hard can that be?

62
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,451
And I'll show you here
this is the hint of that.

63
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,583
If you want some more fun go chat
with Cody and John from my lab,

64
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:27,880
they've been doing these imbalanced VSCMG
equations that are quite interesting.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,770
So let's review this,
what is h.equal to l?

66
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,950
What is l here?

67
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,112
Start in the right hand side, Andre?

68
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:39,334
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Be more specific.

69
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:44,019
>> [INAUDIBLE]
on the body.

70
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,940
>> Which body?

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,778
because we now have multiple.

72
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,250
>> Rigid body.

73
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,244
>> Only on the rigid bodies and
not on the wheels?

74
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,130
No, external torque.

75
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,890
>> Exactly, right?

76
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,480
If this is a dynamical system,

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,230
this applied to blobs in space,
jello flying through space.

78
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,260
But it was the net external torque
acting on this dynamical system.

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,720
Now we don't have blobs but
we will have systems of rotating,

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,970
it's a multi-rigid body problem
essentially that we're solving here.

81
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,790
So that's just the net external torques.

82
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,850
We don't need motor torques.

83
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,575
Whatever that reactional spin
torque is doesn't appear here,

84
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:18,900
because that's an internal torque.

85
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,890
The Gimbal access motor torque does not
appear here it's also an internal torque.

86
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,634
So just the externals, gravity gradients,
solar radiation pressure drag,

87
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,684
maybe you have thrusters to augment this.

88
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,820
Because maybe for momentum dumping
people still use thrusters sometimes,

89
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,870
that could be good.

90
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,339
Now what is the h on the left hand side?

91
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,999
Robert.

92
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:47,215
>> On the tip of my tongue, I'm just-
>> The total angular momentum.

93
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:48,440
>> Total angular momentum, right?

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,650
All of this dynamic assistance.

95
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,780
So if it's a blob, it's just the entire
thing, it's not quite a blob here.

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,988
For us it's a spacecraft, plus the wheels,

97
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:58,220
plus the frame whatever
holds these things together.

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,000
Everything that has momentum,
angular momentum, we have to account for.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,690
And then what's this Baud up here, what
type of time derivative are we taking?

100
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,581
And as you know we often for
good reason do things in a body frame, but

101
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:13,915
transport theorem is
going to be all over this.

102
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,590
We have to do that, right?

103
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,329
We're also about which point have
we taken torks in momentum here?

104
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,020
Center of mass, actually.

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,170
So this either has to be a center
of mass point or taking moments and

106
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,120
torques about an inertial point.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,850
Then h equal to l is true.

108
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,898
If you're talking about a body fix point,
that's anything else than center of mass,

109
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,330
there was extra turnums
that have to appear here.

110
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,258
So again these inbalance things makes
things immediately much more complicated.

111
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,080
So h equal to l.

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,030
We can assume this is all about
the center of mass of this system.

113
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,710
All the wheels are balanced so

114
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,290
even when I'm trying gyrating
I'm not really changing.

115
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,970
When I'm putting the gimballing angles in
I'm not changing the center of mass of

116
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,810
that CMG configuration, I'm just
changing where the axis is pointing.

117
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm changing the inertias but

118
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,130
not center of mass, so
that makes huge simplifications.

119
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,350
So we need some frames to define this
stuff, and I've got this gimbal frame.

120
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,662
So you will have gs is my spin axis,
so this is your wheel,

121
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:13,131
if it's just the reaction wheel
this is all you would have.

122
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:18,034
A reaction wheel in a gimbling frame, this
is how we can twist that spinning wheel,

123
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,820
GG is the gimble axis, and that other.

124
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,930
And the CMG devices solves a pancake with
the motor knob sticking out left and

125
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,750
right, it's actually the gg axis.

126
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,520
And so gs is the spin axis, gimble axis,
and then gt is at the transverse axis,

127
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,720
it's the third axis that
cannot complete a full frame.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,870
GS crossed to GT gives you plus GG, okay?

129
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,330
So that's what these are,
we've defined them.

130
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,420
Big omega here is going to
be the wheel speed and

131
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,560
we're treating it here as time varying.

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,370
Later on we can freeze it to make it
a CMG device, not a variable speed CMG.

133
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,800
Gimbel angles are defined through gamma,
so the gimbel rate

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
at which I am twisting these things is
gamma dot, and that's what that's defined.

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,140
So that's the rotation
rate about this gg axis,

136
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,320
so kinematics is going to come back in.

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,210
And then so the full frame is gs, gt,
gd, that's the g frame that we have.

138
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,740
This is the one we'll use a lot.

139
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,359
So let's talk about angle velocities,

140
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,450
the angular velocity of the gimbal
frame relative to the body.

141
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,590
This is where we attach this device to
a body, because the motor is taking it and

142
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,660
it's twisting it left and right, right?

143
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,500
And so this is the twist rate and the axis
about which you're twisting is gg.

144
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,760
So the angular velocity of the g frame
relative to the b frame is just going

145
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,020
to be gamma times gg.

146
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,130
It's the classic kinematics we did
in the first part of the class.

147
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,450
There's a wheelframe,
I'm going to introduce this quickly, and

148
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,620
then within a few steps,
we're going to ignore it again.

149
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,200
We'll make some arguments
why we can ignore it.

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,250
So the wheelframe needs three axis.

151
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm picking principal axis, so the spin
axis, ds, I can reuse it just to be lazy.

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,800
That's my first one and
then I have a wt and

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,710
a wg which are two axis that
are fixed relative to the wheel,

154
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,748
so as the wheel rotates, these axis
are going to rotate with the wheel, right?

155
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,440
So if you look at the wheel frame,
you can go ahead and

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,970
get the angular velocity of the wheel
system relative to the gimbal frame, and

157
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:28,865
that's simply going to be the wheel's spin
rate times the wheel spin axis, that's it.

158
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:33,800
So if you sat on the wheel frame it's set
all this gimbal frame, look at the wheel

159
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,040
you would see the wheel's spinning about
that axis at that rate and vice versa.

160
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,990
So now we have our two.

161
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,650
If you need omega of w, relative to b,
you would just add up the two of course,

162
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,920
and that's how, so we can get any
combinations of omegas that we need.

163
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,228
Let's talk about inertias.

164
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:56,265
I'm assuming this thing is built in a way
such that I have three principal inertias

165
00:08:56,265 --> 00:09:00,874
of this gimbal contraption and
they'd line up with the gs, gt, gt frame.

166
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,765
Recently good assumption,
may not be perfect but

167
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,610
it's a good simplifying in the analysis
that we're doing right now.

168
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,555
So I have IGS, IGG, GT and IGG.

169
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:13,526
So IG is the inertia's of the gimbal
frame along the ST and G axis.

170
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,255
That's where the subscripts
are coming from.

171
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:19,610
For the wheel, we can write that in
the wheel frame, you're going to have

172
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,270
an inertia about here so that's going to
be the wheel inertia about the s axis.

173
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,340
And then I have Iwt, because the wheel
is perfectly symmetric, right?

174
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,370
No imbalances, no other warping,
all these kind of stuff.

175
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,330
It's going to be the same
inertia about the any

176
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,350
two orthogonal axis in the plane
of the disc, of the wheel, right?

177
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,990
So I just have Iwt, Iwt.

178
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,550
Now, here I'm saying the wheel
inertia in the gimbal frame,

179
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,683
is actually going to be the same as wheel
inertia expressed in the wheel frame.

180
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,315
Why does that happen?

181
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,650
I think this is really,
that's an inertial tensor.

182
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,020
This is a matrix representation
of the inertial tensor,

183
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,740
where I picked the w frame.

184
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,880
Here I'm claiming if I
picked the W frame or

185
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,350
the G frame,
they both give you the same answer.

186
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,450
Why do you think that is?

187
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,468
>> There's a degenerate
Eigenvalue in the w inertia.

188
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,290
>> You're getting mathematical.

189
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,470
No, but you're right.

190
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,530
There is a repeated Eigenvalue in here.

191
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,720
That means that these axes are actually,

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,070
the Eigenaxes that generates
these inertias are not unique.

193
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,280
If we go back and look at that.

194
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,380
We talked about Eigenvalue
of an axis symmetric body.

195
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,520
Where we had IS and
IT in some of the torque

196
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,620
free motion of an axis symmetric body,
all of that stuff.

197
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,830
So you don't have to pick.

198
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,330
I could really, to get this diagonal
from I just have to pick this axis and

199
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,470
I have to pick any two axis that
are orthogonal to GS will do.

200
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,200
If any two axis will do,
I can always pick GT and

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,608
GG if you wanted to, and
they'll give you the same answer.

202
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:05,820
So actually I wrote up
a quick mathematical thing.

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,184
So really I'm going to evaluate this now,
I'm pulling in library.

204
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:15,010
I'm going to define now here
this as a diagonal matrix

205
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,040
in this case the g frame, I've got this.

206
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,706
Now, since GS is my first axis,
I'm doing what we call

207
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:26,664
m1 basically that was the one axis
rotation that we needed with an angle.

208
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:34,002
So, you'd have 1, 0, 0 or
I can do metrics form of wg, right?

209
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:37,627
So that's the classic note, that's
the rotation because we're doing one axis

210
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,563
rotation where the GS is the first axis.

211
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:43,895
So if I translate here from
the gimbal frame to the wheel frame,

212
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:47,734
this is what I could do,
I get this answer and then you can

213
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:52,505
identify what does this cosine
squared the same thing sine squared.

214
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,955
Those things are just
going to drop out to b1, and

215
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,916
after all this math you get nothing but

216
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,974
exactly the same result again even though
we did this code of transformation.

217
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:04,121
So if you don't believe the geometric
arguments, you can quickly do the math and

218
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,104
validate and go, yeah.

219
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:08,810
Actually, this inertia tensor is
diagonally both in the w frame and

220
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,825
in the g frame, that's all we need,

221
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:14,401
because that saves us a lot of transpose
without then end up all you're

222
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,389
doing is creating a lot of trigs that
become one in the end and not needed.

223
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:27,750
Good, so that's kind of helps
explain that one last slide.

224
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,200
Now I need to get some corner frames and
attitudes.

225
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,090
We have the body attitude,
we know how to describe that already,

226
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,510
MRP's, DCM,
Cortanians whatever you want to wish.

227
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,260
We need to get the attitude of the gimball
frame relative to the body frame.

228
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,040
And if you go back and
look at how we defined DCM's, right?

229
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,460
It was basically the mapping from N to B
and I'm just going to write that one out.

230
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,256
If your recall BN ended up being n1,

231
00:12:57,256 --> 00:13:01,588
n2, n3 in B frame components,

232
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:06,713
that was one way to write it or each row,

233
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:14,470
Was the b1, 2 and 3 in N frame components.

234
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,631
So if we go back and look at those
definitions, if you have the three axis,

235
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,149
you can actually construct
the DCN very quickly.

236
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,466
And in fact here, I'm using this one, so
instead of having, what do i have here?

237
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,359
Let me go back.

238
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,181
Here we have BG instead of BM.

239
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:36,582
So instead of n1, 2, 3, I have the G
first, second and third axis I put in.

240
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,362
And then the B frame component
which is how we define them and

241
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,958
that's give you to DCM.

242
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,421
So that works.

243
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,744
So if we have BG.

244
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:49,371
Now if I need to get the inertia
tensor which was diagonal in

245
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,550
the G frame which is great.

246
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,544
But I typically will need it in the end
in the body frame, we'll do a lot of body

247
00:13:55,544 --> 00:14:00,110
frame relative derivatives, I would have
to reimposed multiply with the DCM, right?

248
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,270
To map it from one frame into
another frame and you can do that.

249
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,300
The mathematics here become quite simple,
IG is a diagonal and

250
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,240
this one I can write out like this.

251
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,410
So, let's just kind of
do this by hand once.

252
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,155
So, if I have BG is equal to my first

253
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:24,974
vector, my second, my third,

254
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:29,971
and then I need to compute BG times

255
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:34,788
I in G frame components times B,

256
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:39,050
now G transpose, right?

257
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,160
That would give me IG and the body frame.

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,760
Now, if you write it in the matrix form
like this, it's going to be nothing but

259
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,860
gs, gt, gg that's the BG times

260
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,900
this diagonal which was Igs 0,
0, 0 Igt, 0,

261
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:06,800
0, 0 Igg times the same matrix transposed.

262
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,280
So, this transpose becomes gs transposed,
gt transposed gg transposed, right?

263
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,417
And now you can just start to carry
out all this matrix math here.

264
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:25,467
If you look at the second part,
this is going to be Igs times gs.

265
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,422
You can think of this like a vectrix,

266
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:30,330
matrix of vectors that
we talked about earlier.

267
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:38,270
So out of this, all you'll going to
get is Igs times gs hat transpose Igt,

268
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,690
the second row, 0 times this,
0 time this, drops out, gt

269
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,940
transpose plus Igg, gg transpose.

270
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,807
So that's that part times this, so,

271
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,710
[LAUGH] GS's, let's see.

272
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,471
Actually that's not right, hold on.

273
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,290
This is not a single line.

274
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,470
This is a three by three
times a three by one.

275
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,670
This is not plus, that's wrong.

276
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,430
This would have to go here,
and this goes here.

277
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,460
This should be a three by one.

278
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,930
It's a three by three
times a three by one.

279
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,490
That should be a three by one,
one by three times three by one.

280
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,360
Now all I have to do is gs times
this term, gt times that term,

281
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,270
gg times this term, and
that's where you get the final answer.

282
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,373
So from here, if I go backwards, IGs, Gs,

283
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:45,710
Gs transpose plus these other terms.

284
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,740
That's all we're doing.

285
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,920
So it's a nice analytic way that
we can do these projections

286
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,880
from the inertia of one frame to another.

287
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,762
And you will see this is a handy result
to what we'll use several times as we go

288
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:57,765
through that.

289
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,509
So that's what was done here.

290
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:03,244
This one also in the gimbal frame,
I can just do the same thing, but

291
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:06,336
instead of IGs, IGT,
I have IWs, IWT and that's it.

292
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,510
It's a little bookkeeping.

293
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,760
So you get exactly the same result.

294
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,488
So now we have the inertia's
written in two different frames.

295
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:16,840
Good, next step, Angular Momentum.

296
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,370
You guys said H had to be the angular
momentum of the total system.

297
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,230
The system will be composed
of a single VSCMG, so

298
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,330
it's a spacecraft,
that's part B, that's the body.

299
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,040
Then I have G that denotes the inertia and

300
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,490
momentum of the gimbal frame that has
some mass and it rotates and does stuff.

301
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,610
And then you have HW which is
the momentum of just the wheel

302
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,280
itself spinning about that.

303
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,425
So we have to add up all these momentums.

304
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:47,303
And each one of these momentums
is of these bodies relative to

305
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:49,230
the inertial frame.

306
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,980
So for the body this is dead simple,
you've done this.

307
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,982
I'm using IS now, that is my
inertia tensor of the spacecraft.

308
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,330
You'll see a different
I appearing later on.

309
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,280
So this one right now is just
of the spacecraft itself.

310
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,770
It has the center of mass
of the reaction wheel,

311
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,240
CNG devices already accounted for in that.

312
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,060
But what we're not doing is the momentum
of the wheel-disk part spinning about

313
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,721
the center of mass of those disks.

314
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,530
So a lot of it is already lumped in there.

315
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,230
And this part will be easy to go forth.

316
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,570
The other ones get more complicated.

317
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,540
So for the gimbal frame,
it's the same math at the first step.

318
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,570
We have IG times,
now I need omega G relative to N and

319
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,700
omega G relative to N is omega G relative
to B plus B relative to N, right.

320
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,950
Earlier we kept calling this just omega,
here and being a little explicit

321
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,700
because we've got lots of different
frames and lots of different omegas.

322
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,358
So it's a little bit
easier to keep track of.

323
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,764
So we need both.

324
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:50,270
This one was simply gamma dot times Gg and
that's put in here.

325
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,307
And the other one is omega BN.

326
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:56,705
The inertia one I've written with
this projections into G frame

327
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,900
components already.

328
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,450
So, IG times omega BN
gives me this answer, and

329
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,900
IG times this one will
give me this answer.

330
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,480
Now, again,
I'm jumping through a few steps directly.

331
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,030
So let me just look at it once.

332
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,908
This is a tricky one to do yourself in the
homework and different ways to solve this.

333
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:21,646
One thing you could say is,
you know you have IG like this,

334
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:25,820
and omega G relative to B
is just gamma dot times Gg.

335
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,410
Well Gg times Gg here
transposed just gives you 1.

336
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,594
That's good.

337
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:37,210
Gg times Gt transposed,
what's that going to happen?

338
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,020
The dot product between Gt and Gg.

339
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,020
Zero, they're orthogonal, right?

340
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,120
So that drops out.

341
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,630
And same thing with the Gg times Gs.

342
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,910
They're also orthogonal, they drop out.

343
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,670
So that's one way to do it.

344
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,840
I think on the next slide I show you
another way with the matrix method.

345
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,410
That will give you
the same answer hopefully.

346
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,730
It's the same physics.

347
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,682
Now these terms, gs transposed
with omega BN will happen a lot.

348
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:04,325
If you look at,
if we were showing the definition,

349
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,480
let us recall how we
typically write omega.

350
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:17,529
So omega BN, we typically write it as
omega 1b1 + omega 2b2 + omega 3b3.

351
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,642
So we have a reframe, the omega 1, 2,

352
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:25,051
3s are nothing but the 1,
2 and 3 access components.

353
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:31,380
Omega 1 is really defined
as b1 dotted with omega BN,

354
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:41,010
or in matrix form this is equivalent
to b1 transpose omega BN, all right?

355
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,540
Now, here we don't have b1 dotted with
omega, we have gs dotted with omega.

356
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,603
So if you have omega BN,

357
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:55,310
gs hat, this is really what is going to
give you, if you think of this,

358
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,490
if this is your omega vector.

359
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,990
And here is your gs vector.

360
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,710
It's giving you the gs component
of that omega vector essentially.

361
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,995
And we're just going to call that, instead
of omega 1, 2, 3, we've already used 1, 2,

362
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:10,320
3 for the body frame stuff.

363
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,100
So I can't reuse the same names,
I'm just going to use omegas, omegat and

364
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,119
omegag for the gs, gt,
gg axis of that stuff.

365
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,630
So a slight notational thing but
it helps us.

366
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,260
So that's what you see defined right here.

367
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,295
Where we have Omega s is gs
hat transpose with omega.

368
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:35,324
Omega T is gT transpose with omega and
gg is the projection of g onto omega.

369
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:42,060
So the omega vector, this is again without
any subscripts, we imply it's omega BN.

370
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,840
At some point it just gets old to write
all that stuff over and over again.

371
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,310
So this is omega BN is equal to

372
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,700
these three vector components
of that along the g axis.

373
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,730
So if you use that definition then you
have here gs transpose times omega and

374
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,590
that becomes nothing but
this little omega s.

375
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,410
So, the same momentum expression here can
be rewritten a little bit more compactly

376
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,770
in this form and that will help us
in same label keeping that we do.

377
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,880
So, now we have to angular momentum
vector off the g frame relative to

378
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,556
the inertial frame.

379
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:16,345
What we need next is the angular
momentum of the wheel.

380
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,250
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Itself.

381
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,370
Then it's the same formula.

382
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,220
You need the angular velocity of
the wheel relative to inertial, and

383
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,400
we know the angular velocity of
the wheel relative to gimbal.

384
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,226
That was big omega times gs.

385
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:30,805
That was the spin axis side.

386
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,020
Gimbal relative to body,

387
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,260
that was the gamma dot times Gg,
that's the gimbaling rate.

388
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,990
And then of course, this is the classic
spacecraft body rate that you'd have.

389
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,111
If you plug that in you now have
three of these terms to evaluate.

390
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:48,119
And I will just to show you different ways
to do it, I'll do it different ways here.

391
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,740
This first term I've written out, and

392
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,586
it's going to be this inertia tensor
which we rewrote earlier as a result of

393
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:59,975
the principal inertias times
these outer products times omega.

394
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:04,390
And in here quickly you can see
again gs hat transposed omega.

395
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,680
That's what we defined to be omega s.

396
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,130
The projection of the gs axis onto
omega was the omega s component.

397
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,500
Same thing with omega t and omega g.

398
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,430
So that's one way we can
get that first term.

399
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,440
That gives us this one.

400
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,610
Now we want to get the other two.

401
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,430
I'm showing you a matrix representation,
for

402
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,910
some people this might be
a easier way to think.

403
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,490
Both of them should all
give you the same stuff.

404
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,760
This term I can write in G frame
components as this diagonal matrix.

405
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,510
G relative to B,
that was gamma dot times Gg.

406
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,905
So, in g frame component it's
00 gamma dot, all right?

407
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:45,683
And then you just do your typical matrix
math with which will give you 00 IWt that

408
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:49,350
along the third axis,
as the vector representation of that.

409
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,555
That's the third axis is Gg, so
you always get back the same answer.

410
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:58,995
You could do the same thing also for
this one, just here omega w relative to g

411
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:03,850
was big omega times gs, so it's big omega
along the first axis of the wheel frame.

412
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,090
This inertia tensor in the wheel frame.

413
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,280
You carry out the matrix math,

414
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,750
you get just something in the first axis,
which is the gs representation.

415
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,510
So, this ties back to the, you know,
week one stuff that we did.

416
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,980
Vector matrix representation.

417
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,340
You should be able to go back and
forth and

418
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,510
whatever's most convenient It'll get you
there, it should be the same answer.

419
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,360
Now, we have these, we add them up
to the other term, you combine them,

420
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,800
this gives us now the angular
momentum of the wheel that we need.

421
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,570
Okay, great.

422
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,960
A few more things, as we take derivatives,
we'll want inertial derivatives and,

423
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,760
of course, we'll use transport theorems
because a lot of these inertia tensors

424
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,850
are fixed by the body frame.

425
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,050
And also some of these
other axis have benefits.

426
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,920
So, the gs, gt,

427
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,740
gg axis you could write analytically if
you know their orientation at launch.

428
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,150
I locked them down and gs was pointing
here and gt was pointing here, and

429
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,620
there's no gimble angle, right?

430
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,495
And after launch, you rotated 15 degrees,

431
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:07,414
you can actually compute with
your classic cosines and sines.

432
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:10,605
What are the current
orientations of those axes?

433
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:14,281
gg stays always the same, hopefully,
that means you bolted it down correctly,

434
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,010
all right?

435
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,760
The gimbal axis is supposed
to stay body fixed, always.

436
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,031
But for a VSCMG, the GSGT, we have
to treat generally as time varying.

437
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:26,820
So, you can write this and
in code in fact, it would simulate this.

438
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,110
If I know my gimbal angle I
can't compute at any instant.

439
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,920
If I know my initial orientations at
launch what are my current orientations of

440
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,040
this frame of the wheel?

441
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,730
How far has it twisted?

442
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,070
All right, so
we will need derivatives of this stuff.

443
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,950
If we take body frame derivatives,
different ways you can do it.

444
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,970
If you want to, you could just use this
expression here and take derivatives.

445
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,990
because these are actually
fixed as seen by the body.

446
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,700
And cosine becomes minus sine,
which is right here.

447
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,650
Sine becomes cosine, and
you can see the derivative of this is

448
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,110
going to be the gt direction and
vice versa.

449
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,450
And the derivative of this one is just
common sense, is going to be zero.

450
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,620
That's one way.

451
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,289
Or you can also use a transport
theorem and say, well wait a minute,

452
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,360
instead of taking the b frame, what if I
took the g frame derivative of this stuff?

453
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,650
And if you have the g frame
derivative of gs that is zero,

454
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,360
I see by the frame itself
these axes don't move.

455
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,655
Plus you would need the omega g
relative to b, which is gamma delta gg,

456
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:34,880
crossed with this axis, you get a g,
a third axis cross with gs,

457
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,340
the first axis which gives
you plus the second one.

458
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,150
You can see the transport theorem,
you get the same answer.

459
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,340
Different ways you can approach it.

460
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,450
I like the transport, it's very compact,
you can get there very,

461
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,230
very quickly without writing it out.

462
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,600
So, we can get the body frame derivatives,

463
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,350
the key is the third one,
that's where it's locked down.

464
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,297
That one doesn't vary, the other two
are a function of the gimbal rate.

465
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:59,481
If you need inertial derivatives,
which we can do it here,

466
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:01,849
we've chosen to do b-frame derivatives.

467
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:04,625
We've already got these
answers as a sub-result,

468
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,620
plus the omega crossed these axes again.

469
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,570
And you can do that, and
carry out, if you write omega.

470
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,910
The easy trick here is to get this
answer in your homework I would say.

471
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,940
Write omega node as omega 1 b1,
omega 2 b2 because you're crossing the gs.

472
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,460
Instead write omega as omega s gs,
omega t gt, right?

473
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,018
Use the g frame components of omega and
those definitions and

474
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:31,140
that's where these terms come in.

475
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,290
And then, it's just a classic
cross products between vectors in

476
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,120
the same frame.

477
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,208
So, 1 crossed 2 gives you 3, 3 crossed 1
give you minus 2, all the usual rules.

478
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:42,430
And that's how you can
get there then as well.

479
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,440
So, that would work.

480
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,330
So then,
you should derive this yourself then.

481
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,070
I'm just kind of showing you
the highlights and how we go after it.

482
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,820
Since we have omega s, omega t and

483
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,470
omega g, the vector components of
the body rate in the g frame components.

484
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,870
We will also have derivatives of this.

485
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,585
Omega s, omega t, omega g are scalars.

486
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,181
So, what type of derivative am
I taking on the left hand side?

487
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,481
Tebow.

488
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:17,499
>> Time derivative it's-
>> As seen by what frame?

489
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:18,187
>> Doesn't matter.

490
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:19,188
>> Doesn't matter, right?

491
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:21,812
Just a scalar, so
that stuff comes back again.

492
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:24,175
If it's just a scalar it's
just a time derivative.

493
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:28,923
Over here, Tebow, what type of
derivative have I chosen to use here?

494
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:29,958
>> An inertila derivative.

495
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,886
>> Inertial derivative.

496
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:34,550
But that was purely a choice, I didn't
have to use an inertial derivative.

497
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,970
I could have used any,
as long as I'm consistent,

498
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,020
you can't use these derivative chain rules
into one part in a and one part in b.

499
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,480
If you've taken a, make everything a,
if you've taken b, make everything b.

500
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,330
The math will work itself out.

501
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,880
So, you can do that, so
that term is just okay,

502
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,200
the angular acceleration dotted
in the the gs direction, great.

503
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,728
This term here, gs hat transposed omega.

504
00:28:56,728 --> 00:29:01,798
If you go back and look at gs hat is here,

505
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:07,791
so we have all this math times,
what did we do,

506
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:13,044
times omega, gs hat transposed omega.

507
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:17,675
So, if you can see here, gs hat,
this stuff, transposed omega,

508
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:21,272
gt transposed with omega,
what does that give me?

509
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:22,410
>> Omega t.

510
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,580
>> Omega t, exactly.

511
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,795
That was the projection.

512
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:28,539
Gg transposed omega gives you omega g.

513
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:33,115
And you're going to have an omega g, omega
t with that product and here omega t,

514
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,638
omega g with the product.

515
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:39,630
1 plus, 1 minus, they both cancel and all
you're left with is here times gt times

516
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,200
that term, that second term, which was gt
transposed omega which gives you omega t.

517
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,690
Let's say we did body frame.

518
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,030
How is that going to look different?

519
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,650
Let me do that by hand.

520
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,800
So, just so I can prove, so if we use this
formula, I don't need to fire here, okay.

521
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,410
If we use this formula as Tebow says,
that's just a time derivative.

522
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,730
Now, let's say,
I'm going to use body frames.

523
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,750
I'm going to use primes as a body frame
instead of writing ddt and b's and

524
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,900
all that stuff.

525
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,438
You would have gs transposed prime,

526
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:22,628
right, times omega plus
gs hat omega BN prime.

527
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:27,180
Well, one thing, omega BN prime, how does
that relate to the initial derivative?

528
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,640
It's the same thing, right?

529
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,600
Omega, the B and the N frame is the same.

530
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,920
So, that's kind of cool.

531
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,850
We get right away gs hat transposed
omega BN dot, the inertial derivative.

532
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,540
So, that's good.

533
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,920
This one, we need the body
frame derivative of gs, and

534
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,110
if you go back, we did that actually and
I had showed you the results.

535
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,615
Here we go.

536
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:53,756
The body framed derivative of that,
different ways you can derive it, but

537
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:57,322
I'll use the transport theorem,
was nothing but gamma dot gt.

538
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:02,432
And if I plug that one in,
gamma dot gt transposed omega BN,

539
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:07,340
this whole thing is nothing but
the definition of that and

540
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,970
you get the same answer.

541
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,571
So, as expected, hopefully, we took here,
b frame derivatives, in the slides I'm

542
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:18,790
taking n frame derivatives,
I get the same answer both ways.

543
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,370
So, that's always a good thing to practice
then you know you're doing all your

544
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,050
math correctly.

545
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,080
So, you do this and you apply this now for
all the three axes and

546
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,930
now we have the inertial derivative
that you will need as a sub result

547
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,730
once we start to take H dot and
start grinding.

548
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,460
So, we have that.

549
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,250
One other thing we'll use is
you will see a lot in the math,

550
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,210
we have ig plus iws appearing.

551
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,030
And that's the inertia of
the wheel plus the inertia

552
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,870
of the gimbal frame that
holds the wheel and twists.

553
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,230
And so, we can sum them up.

554
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,720
If you see js, it's nothing, but

555
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,630
basically the inertia of the combined
wheel gimbal frame system.

556
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,580
So, just a notational thing,
because there's lots of stuff happening.

557
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:07,337
And now the fun, you need to do this
yourself, I'm showing you the highlights.

558
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:11,790
[LAUGH] But this is now where you
apply your excellent skills on

559
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,415
transport theorem and differentiation,
we need H dot = L, so

560
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:21,389
I would say since we've broken it up
as H of the hub B H of the gimbal and

561
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,120
H of the wheel, do each separately.

562
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,960
It just helps manage all the algebra.

563
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,268
Otherwise you're bound to get
one letter crossed with another.

564
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,340
Do one by at the time.

565
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,265
So if I take H dot using
the transport theorem.

566
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:35,345
I take the derivative as
seen by the gimbal frame,

567
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:37,165
because I'm using a lot of
gimbal frame components.

568
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,685
But then I need to add plus
omega of the gimbal frame,

569
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,414
relative to the inertial, right?

570
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:45,420
because dot is still the inertial
derivative, cross with that H expression,

571
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,786
carry all that algebra.

572
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:50,384
This is what you get,
I'll let you do that.

573
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,331
You guys are very good at this now.

574
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:56,104
You do the same thing for
the gimbal stuff and this is what you get,

575
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:57,950
the gimbal frame stuff.

576
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,580
And then for the body itself, well that's
pretty trivial, we've done this before for

577
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,600
a single rigid body, you regain
the same derivative expression, right?

578
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,020
Now we pack it together H dot
= L is a sum of all three.

579
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,212
We're going to use this definition,
J was the inertia of the gimbal frame and

580
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:19,760
the wheel, the combined VSCMG device.

581
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,060
This is the inertia of the rigid
part of the spacecraft.

582
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,750
So this one is actually constant,
as seen by the body frame.

583
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,430
This one isn't, because inertia,
everything is spinning and twisting.

584
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:36,680
And I now is the combined spacecraft
inertia, that's the full thing.

585
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,050
The rigid part plus all these spinning,
twisting wheel parts, all combined.

586
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,410
That means I in this notation
actually becomes time varying.

587
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,690
If you simulate these things,
every time step,

588
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,750
you have to recompute where are these
axes, where are these inertias and

589
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,180
sum up all these inertia
contributions again.

590
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,090
So it becomes even as seen by the body, I
is time varying but IS is the rigid part.

591
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,990
That's what you took advantage of when you
did the earlier differentiation of HB,

592
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,010
that it was fixed as
seen by the body frame.

593
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,965
Yes, Louis?
>> How do you guys account for

594
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,600
the center of mass of the gimbal system,
in the body or no?

595
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,080
>> So all of these things have
been taken in account for.

596
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,640
IS here actually already accounts for
the parallel axis part.

597
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,928
That if the CG of the wheels aren't
mounted in the center of the spacecraft,

598
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:24,120
center of mass of the spacecraft,
but they're offset somehow.

599
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,990
That is a fixed offset, and
that's already accounted for

600
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,120
actually here when we derive this stuff.

601
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,340
So here these are just the wheel
parts that that's the momentum and

602
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,650
inertia is spinning about their
own perspective center of masses.

603
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,732
So center of mass is all subtlety.

604
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:43,271
I'm glossing over somewhat, but
this is rigorous, this works,

605
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:47,330
it's just you have to account for
depending on where you place them, okay.

606
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,675
There's this much mass out there,

607
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:51,920
that M distance squared term
is already put into this part.

608
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,938
because that part is fixed,
relative, it's a balanced wheel.

609
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:58,260
If it's inbalanced, your question would be
very good, because then with an imbalance,

610
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,180
as I'm rotating, then the center of mass

611
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,934
of the wheel is actually orbiting inside
the craft and then this wouldn't work.

612
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:08,940
You'd have to be much more careful
about which points you do it so.

613
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,536
Being balanced allows us to,
as complicated as it is, and I'm sure

614
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:17,110
you'll agree in the homework, being
balanced makes this much, much easier.

615
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,100
So that's a key assumption, so
now we throw this all together.

616
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,052
H dot = L, and I combine terms,
which you will do as well,

617
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:26,894
you can come up with
these kind of a terms.

618
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:29,188
Now this is the I inertial
tensor of the hub,

619
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,740
the rigid plus all the spinning stuff.

620
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,960
You can write it out into this form,
which is our equation of motion of

621
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,670
the spacecraft with a single
variable speed CMG.

622
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,439
L is still the net external torque
we were talking about earlier, so

623
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,792
that could be your gravity gradient torque
acting on this or deviation pressure,

624
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,187
if we have thrusters acting for
generating pure torques.

625
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,080
But it's all about
the system center of mass.

626
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,840
And then inside you have all these terms.

627
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,874
So the first thing I always do is let's
make sure these equations make sense if we

628
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:57,524
simplify them.

629
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:03,800
If we bolt down like on launch, we have no
gimbling, we have no wheel acceleration,

630
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,740
everything is locked down for launch, I
should get back the equations of motion of

631
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,530
a single rigid body, which was
this part and this part and the L.

632
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,310
Everything else should vanish.

633
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,013
So if you look at that and you see, okay,
if I have gamma dot, if I'm locked down,

634
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,490
there's no gimbling going on.

635
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,290
So gamma dot has to be 0.

636
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,543
This vanishes, this vanishes, let's see,

637
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:30,330
gimbal acceleration vanishes.

638
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,760
That's 0 and this is 0, so
no gimbling makes a lot of them vanish.

639
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,816
If you take the remaining
equations you've got one here,

640
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:43,718
IWS omega dot, and you've got this
is all vanished, that vanished.

641
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:47,710
You got this term that's non-zero,
and this term that's non-zero.

642
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,885
Go back and look at your dual
spinner equations of motion.

643
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:57,430
There we lined it up with the real
axis being along B1 or something.

644
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,110
So if you make GSB1,

645
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,110
you get exactly the same equations again,
so that's a nice validation.

646
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,780
If the wheel is locked down,
then big omega is 0.

647
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,820
That means this term vanishes as well,
this term vanishes as well,

648
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,880
and there's no wheel acceleration.

649
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,920
So, as expected,

650
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,000
all these terms vanish once you
lock it down, which is always good.

651
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,390
Now, so this is good for both devices, but

652
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,430
you can see the gimbling
adds a lot of terms.

653
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,412
There's gamma, gamma, gamma,
all the stuff that happens here.

654
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:29,690
What if you have a reaction wheel mode,
we talked about that.

655
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,140
We basically get a double spin
equations of motion, way simpler.

656
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,706
What if we make it a classic CMG?

657
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:40,430
In that case, the wheel's speed has
to be constant, not variable speed.

658
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,824
Let's see how much it simplifies then.

659
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,631
One term, woop-de-doo.

660
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:50,232
You got all this other stuff, so

661
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,790
the CMGs really aren't that much
easier than the variable speed CMGs,

662
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,320
you just now accounted for
all the other stuff spinning and gyrating.

663
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,500
>> Why is it that they
haven't flown VSCMGs?

664
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,681
>> They have, and in fact every
CMG is in fact a variable speed

665
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:08,100
CMG because it launches spun down and
they have to slowly spin it up.

666
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,650
But what they do is a simple control
that they, it's complexity of the stuff.

667
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,940
Here, let me show you what generates
the control that you have.

668
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,970
We have body rates are pretty small.

669
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,420
I mean, we're talking small.

670
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,790
People freak out when this craft goes
more than two degrees per second,

671
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,090
that's nothing.

672
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,020
The wheels will be going way, way faster.

673
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,291
So CMGs, we're looking at 10,000 rpm.

674
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:32,240
So the big omega is going to
be the big honking elephant.

675
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,690
So this is small, gimbal rates are small,
this stuff is all small.

676
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,730
What's going to give us the big torque?

677
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,770
It's going to be this term, right here,
that's the wheel speed, which is huge.

678
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,190
IWs, which is your biggest inertia of this
disk because we move the mass out about

679
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,210
the GS axis, that give us that ring,
the pancake shape.

680
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,410
And gamma dot is directly
proportional to that.

681
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,970
So, if you hold the fixed wing speed, this
is the control torque that we would use

682
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,930
in a control application, and
that's what they're after.

683
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,640
You could make everything else variable,
but that's really more in a later

684
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,230
research, we've been finding in
how we can avoid singularities.

685
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,210
But the trick is, with the reaction wheel,
what generates the torque is this one.

686
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,720
I'll show you the motor torque
equation in the next class.

687
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,230
But as you accelerate a wheel you get,
with a minus sign,

688
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,390
an opposite torque back onto the craft.

689
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,210
But you only get one Newton meter in,
you get one Newton meter out.

690
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,087
Here though, if I gimble, with a little
effort, the faster the wheel is going,

691
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,825
the bigger the torque I get.

692
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:36,650
And that's what they've been focusing on.

693
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,060
So, devices could do this.

694
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,300
The issue is the motor torque about the
spin axis typically are not that strong.

695
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,958
If you have to muscle through a
singularity acting like a reaction wheel,

696
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,502
you're simply going to saturate that
little motor very, very quickly.

697
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,279
So the way they're designing it,
they're doing the minimal effort required,

698
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:59,165
which means it tracks it within a simple
bound, but it's not very tight bound, and

699
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,297
it doesn't have much.

700
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,580
It may take, it just needs you to spin it
up and keep it roughly at the same speed,

701
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,561
that's all they need.

702
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:06,932
So it would be a hardware change.

703
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:10,698
So some have flown them like this and
actually demonstrated that you can do it,

704
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:14,467
it's just a little bit more complexity
in the control and people, air force in

705
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,951
particular have been looking at these
form of energy storage devices and

706
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:19,215
to account for them.

707
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:22,248
There's extra complexity,
they feel like I can do it.

708
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:26,570
Or some CMG manufacturer who was
chatting with me during my PhD too, and

709
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,700
they're saying well, we could also take
a reaction wheel off the shelf and a CMG

710
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,500
off the shelf, and combine both devices
to get the same mathematical benefits.

711
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,900
Off the shelf is always
cheaper than trying to custom

712
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,380
design specifically for something.

713
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,820
So until these become common,
there's different ways you can do it.

714
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,350
But for here, this is kind of,
where are we going to go?

715
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,987
So what we can see, my final comments on
this is, with these equations of motion,

716
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:57,400
you see now there that as the wheel speed
grows, we can get a very large torque.

717
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,400
But also there's limits in each reaction
wheel, how fast you can spin it and

718
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,912
that's that big omega dot.

719
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:06,808
The gimbling is a nice mode, but
you will also have singularities.

720
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:10,192
Actually, I think I could
show those as well.

721
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:13,980
This will be something about the gt axis,
that's one axis.

722
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,850
If I have four devices,
I'm going to have four gt axes.

723
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,918
And depending on how you've lined it up,

724
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:22,172
you can have all those
axes become coplanar.

725
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:25,947
And if your control is outside of that,
which will happen commonly with external

726
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:28,346
disturbances, that's
a gimbal lock situation.

727
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:32,171
Because these axis about which I get these
nice generous torques vary with time,

728
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,437
it just makes a lot of
things more complicated.

729
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:38,087
But that was the singularity that
we have so, anyway so you can see,

730
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,355
CMGs, definitely a lot of benefits,
the amplification but

731
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:43,998
also mechanical challenges,
more expensive.

732
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:45,950
But you get a lot of bang for your buck,

733
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,187
way bigger torques than what you
get with a reaction wheel, but

734
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,447
it comes at a cost and
the controls get more challenging, too.
