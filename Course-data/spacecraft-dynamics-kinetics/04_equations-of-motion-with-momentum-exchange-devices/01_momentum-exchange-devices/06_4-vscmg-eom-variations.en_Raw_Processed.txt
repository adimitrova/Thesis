now, going to look 
this simplifies 
if we a single reaction wheel, 
we mentioned earlier, 
if you 
gimbal rates zero, 
gimbal acceleration is zero 
that means this whole frame is 
locked down, relative to body, 
earlier equations 
simplify to this form 
thats nice 
so now, we 
is you could rewrite this 
going to use motor torque 
equation to get rid big omega dot 
so im taking that extra differential 
equation, im going to solve 
omega dot, back substitute so 
i get spacecraft accelerations 
in terms motor torque 
one thing, i show you this 
in identity, this term here, 
a little bit algebra, you 
show that relates to omega cross gs 
just, 
if you carry cross product terms, 
thats you come 
so thats i used to 
replace this this part 
next thing is this is motor 
torque equation without gimbaling, so 
theres gamma tau term in there 
thats good 
so you see in here, 
there is a js times big omega dot 
js times big omega dot 
i could directly substitute this, 
i take js times this, bring 
to left hand side substitute 
this back in here, i that 
if you that, you end 
a term here thats going to js 
this is js times this, 
youre still going to a js here, 
gs, gs transposed omega dot 
here we full 
inertia tensor times this 
this inertia space 
craft inertia plus gimbal 
wheel frame inertia 
so i is this plus js, 
ts, gs transpose, well 
since, you substitute this 
back in there, you get this extra term 
like this last 
term you here 
two actually cancel 
so, reaction wheel form that im 
showing you, people often ignore this 
include that extra term, 
doesnt make momentum work 
this will full answer 
you then, so redefining that, i 
rewrite groups in terms a little 
bit, this is classic form 
that you would see reaction wheels 
reaction wheels we come 
control loss that ill show one example 
then, we come 
torque level control loss 
cmgs i cover in , we dont come 
motor torque level control loss 
we come gimbal rates 
mario is pointing right 
we want to take advantage that 
gyroscopic torque we twist 
so we command a twist rate 
you a sub server system 
that implements that twist rate 
thats bunch 
lectures in future 
so this is classic 
equation motion a wheel, 
spacecraft 
a single reaction wheels 
oriented in a general way, gs, 
gt, dont to line b one, 
two 
three like we dual spinner 
thats youd end in there, 
so good 
thats a single device 
if you a single cmg, thats really 
much, you guys mentioned earlier, 
this one term vanishes, 
youre left everything else 
this is still form that we use 
we dont solve motor torques, 
we dont back substitute here 
in fact, this is term that gives 
us huge gyroscopic effect 
big omega times small gimbal rate, 
is still a 
big torque acting 
so, in fact, to control valves this 
you find come laws to come 
desired gimbal rates to give 
you commanded steering 
gyroscopics 
this is full 
torque level solution 
weve done single vscmg devices 
typically you dont fly a single one, we 
fly clusters four least vscmgs, 
reaction wheels you may three, 
four 
ive seen six 
depends on, you might use 
three redundancy 
also maybe torque 
maybe a single wheel that you get 
shelf gives you one newton meter, 
maneuvers require one 
a half newton meter 
so you may double wheels 
to get bang there 
so we to deal clusters, 
systems 
in essence everything 
weve done still holds 
comes to book keeping 
problem if you multiple wheels 
we one wheel, 
that is going to a gsi, right 
first gs axis, second gs axis 
thing transverse 
gimbal, everything n 
theres convenient projection 
matrices im making a three 
n matrix n number cmg devices, 
projections calculated 
this inertia, 
hub plus single vscmg, 
list a hub plus a summation 
those, right 
so we carry that 
kind a calculation 
rest gyroscopic terms 
grouped this tau vectors 
gyroscopic terms within 
theyre n ones you will see 
one torques acts 
gs gsn axes 
gt gn axis, 
gg one to ggn axis 
so allows you to write in a little 
bit compact way, this way whereas 
before, we gs times terms 
if you like this, 
would take you probably two pages 
to write every single term 
so allows you to cheat a little bit, 
use substitutions 
notations to simplify 
so if you one wheel, 
really multiple wheels 
is a bookkeeping problem 
hard part is done, i 
want to a nice bookkeeping method 
we look 
examples is kinetic energy 
we kinetic energy that hub, 
great, you got wheel 
a spin rate relative to body 
wheel also gimbal 
so if you go back 
look omega w relative to n, 
big omega gamma in there 
inertia, combined inertia system, 
you write this out, 
thats kinetic energy 
beauty you guys arent 
in this class, gets to this fun 
you take derivatives this, 
plug in equations motion, 
lots algebra later 
you come looking 
power equation that weve 
weve solved this power equation 

rotational part you proved that omega 
dotted l power that you 
if an external torque is acting 
so way you want to 
look this though, 
this is kind called 
workenergy principle 
this torque is torque that acts 
body relative to inertia 
youre pushing thrusters, 
youre really pushing inertial space, 
so to speak that 
omega is body relative to inertia 
big omega here, thats wheel speed 
wheel relative to gimbal frame 
us is motor torque acting between 
wheel gimbal frame 
little gamma dot is angular velocity 
between gimbal frame body 
ug is torque acting between 
gimbal frame body 
this patterns holds, 
youll see this in a lot 
analytic dynamics text materials 
youve recognized 
know gets there, 
instead taking this derivative 
getting there really powerful 
saves you lots days algebra 
anyway, so 
we a nice power expression even 
really complicated 
multi vscmg equation 
we dont much in this class, 
classes you might see 
so next step is lets we 
equations motion 
a single reaction wheel 
if we apply principle, 
we this irw, 
instead we to account 
transverse 
gimbal axis directions 
wheel inertia in this irw 
instead one, 
we n 
so a summation again, right 
we this h vector 
we saw this h vector a dual spinner 
point i defined 
momentum second, 
dual part, 
relative to body like that 
thats also appearing here 
this is kind a common notation 
you put this together, 
a little bit algebra, much 
you write 
equations motions 
nice matrix form us is stack, 
n motor torques 
you get this 
angular rate acceleration 
nice thing this form is l dont 
big omega dot showing anymore 
l mean l know 
motor torques are, 
l essentially decoupled 
two differential equations 
l get omega dot directly 
that motor torque you applied 
to motor torque equations, 
you know big omega dot is 
you substitute in a known 
you get big omega dots, 
wheel acceleration 
so this gives you a way, 
weve kind analytically one 
way solved sets equations 
thats good 
so thats if you a system 
a popular configuration gs, thats 
projection axis is you line 
first wheel b, second wheel 
b third wheel b 
in that case, 
this projection matrix is nothing 
is an identity matrix, 
right 
gs drop 
you end this form 
this form is nice if you even 
try to perfectly b if 
youre a degree two 
this form allows you to solve in a much 
general way without that perfect 
alignment assumption 
thats a differential equation 
we control well use this particular 
differential equation, 
come a control development 
to stabilizing that youll see
