1
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:09,885
A review from last time, we talked
about momentum controlled devices,

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,370
let's do a quick thing.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,576
What was the big benefit, Kevin,

4
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:19,040
of momentum controlled devices versus
thrusters to do attitude control?

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,210
>> Can have a more precise
control of the attitude.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,441
>> Okay, I mean, we can give just
a really small torques on it.

7
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:30,571
Though that's slowly changing because
people are coming up with very

8
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:34,992
interesting micro thrusters that can
also do nano Newton meters of force.

9
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:40,595
And so historically that's been precisely
true, 10, 20 years from now, we'll see.

10
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:43,146
[LAUGH] It's evolving,
but that's definitely so

11
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:44,670
we can make some more forces.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,520
What else, Mariel?

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,560
>> You don't have to use fuel.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,120
>> No fuel, that is the big benefit.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,650
So regardless of, well, those little micro
devices are probably very efficient,

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,590
they may not take much fuel.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,920
But it's still a finite resource.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,780
Versus these wheels,
it's purely electrical.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,380
Part of that is a motor,
an electric motor, that we drive.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,390
You give it a voltage,
it spins up, all right?

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,496
So with reaction wheel,
you put 1 Newton meter in on that torque,

22
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:07,892
you get 1 Newton meter back.

23
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,470
It's a 1 to 1 relationship, which is nice.

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,140
But we have to also develop the motor
torque equations, which we'll do today.

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,458
What we did last time was developed
equations of motion of a spacecraft with

26
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:22,170
the single variables b, c, and g, or
at least, I outlined how you develop them.

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,660
There's lots of little steps
in between that you're doing.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,497
But so today too, we need extra equations
of motion that we'll talk about

29
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:31,534
today when it comes together.

30
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:36,180
What is the benefit of a CMG device
then compared to a reaction wheel?

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,848
Mandar, what do you think?

32
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:43,477
>> CMGs use a high spin rate,
which stabilize,

33
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:48,670
as opposed to reaction wheels,
which need to spin.

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,950
>> So it's the highest spin,
what gives you a stability?

35
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:56,842
>> No, sorry, they use high spin
rate to generate the torque.

36
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:57,980
>> Generate the torque, exactly.

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,684
There's a huge gyroscopic coupling.

38
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,917
If your wheel is spinning quickly,
and my arm is my torque vector,

39
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:06,459
if you're twisting that arm,
you're changing that momentum vector.

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,789
And h dot equal to l,
a change in momentum, must be a torque.

41
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,830
That's that huge gyroscopic torque
that can be taken advantage of it.

42
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,310
Great, so we get huge torques.

43
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,970
If you have to maneuver very quickly or
maneuver very large objects,

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,130
like space stations and really big
satellites, CMGs are definitely preferred.

45
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,050
Otherwise, you would need huge wheels.

46
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,899
What's the challenge with
reaction wheels though?

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,410
They're simple, they're cheaper,
what's the big issue?

48
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,710
So less torque, right, but what else?

49
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,270
>> So there can be static
dynamic imbalance of the wheel.

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,810
>> I didn't think about that,
but that's correct.

51
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,770
You could have an imbalance.

52
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,873
That's always the case, but
that's also true for a CMG.

53
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,399
No mechanical device is ever
perfectly balanced, all right?

54
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:49,033
So and a CMG actually moving at a very
high frequency is going to give you this

55
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:53,024
very high frequency jitter that you just
have to make sure your system handles,

56
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,242
and it's not an issue.

57
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:58,530
Every structure kind of absorbs some of
that jitter, acts like a low-pass filter.

58
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,308
So, people have to design that.

59
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,820
Yeah, so imbalances,
if you're doing a reaction wheel,

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,780
you go from slow speed to high speed.

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,531
And you go through all the frequencies, so

62
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,131
you may want to model if you
have structural residences.

63
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:15,402
If the sense of platform has
a 10 hertz first mode stiffness,

64
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:19,688
you may not want to hang out at 10
hertz a long time with a wheel.

65
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,812
because you would be
exciting that frequency.

66
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:23,832
So there might be things
like that to consider.

67
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,254
But what's the fundamental challenge?

68
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:29,697
Why can't we just use reaction wheels and
apply a torque indefinitely?

69
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:30,307
Andrew.

70
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,119
>> Desaturate?

71
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:35,151
>> Desaturate, right, at some point,
you physically just can't go faster.

72
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,907
The bearings break down,
there might be heat dissipation issues.

73
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,776
There's all kinds of stuff, an issue.

74
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:44,105
So with CMGs,
we're going at a fixed speed nominally.

75
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:47,190
So I don't have any speed limits because
I'm just running at a fixed speed.

76
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,760
I can always keep twisting.

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,790
What is the problem we
have with CMGs then?

78
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,789
Casey.
>> We have gimbal lock.

79
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:54,750
>> Gimbal lock, right?

80
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,682
So with the reaction wheels,

81
00:03:56,682 --> 00:04:01,270
the axis about which we produce
a torque is fixed as seen by the body.

82
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,610
because its wheel is bolted down, right?

83
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,538
And we had some pictures on this,
let me just go down a few.

84
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,546
I like it because it looks beefy,
it's really bolted down,

85
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:14,010
this spin X, the motor axis doesn't
change as seen by the body.

86
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,108
So it's always, you put on this
1 Newton meter on this wheel,

87
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,981
it always gives you a torque about that
axis, no matter what the body is doing.

88
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:27,950
Versus if you go look at CMGs, which we
had here, now, this is our spin axis.

89
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,100
But then there's a gimbal axis,
and that varies with time.

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,480
And the gyroscopics we were
hearing about earlier,

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,630
that's always about that transverse axis.

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,300
If this is my spin axis and
that's my gimbal axis,

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,290
then the change in momentum is about the
third axis, that's the GT axis we called.

94
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,350
And that axis varies as you gimbal.

95
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,720
So I could only get that big
gyroscopic torque about a single axis.

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,840
And what can happen with gimbal
lock is with multiple devices,

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,410
those axes can all become coplanar.

98
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,700
In fact, that's what would happen
if you would just go there,

99
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,020
take the spacecraft, and an astronaut just
goes there and keeps pressing against it,

100
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,590
just to be an irritant,
that spacecraft will hold an attitude.

101
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,640
But eventually,
all the gimbals will line up,

102
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,340
such that all the GT axes are orthogonal
to that torque being applied.

103
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,960
And then you have gimbal arc,
and everything starts tumbling.

104
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,820
So any momentum exchange devices has some
momentum limitations in terms of speeds or

105
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,880
orientations or how you cannot absorb
infinite amount of momentum onto a system.

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
That's just not physically possible.

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,540
There's always a finite
limit that we're seeing.

108
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,360
So good, this is what we went through.

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,330
Now deriving equations of motion,

110
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,949
what was the one overriding equation
that drives all this stuff?

111
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,246
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> H dot=L, so Casey,

112
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:41,148
let's go through this quickly.

113
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:43,160
H was what for this system?

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,770
>> The total angular momentum.

115
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,920
>> Of the dynamical system, right?

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,770
And here we have the spacecraft,
we have a gimbal structure, and

117
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,870
then we have the wheel within
that gimbal structure.

118
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,750
So we actually have three components.

119
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,781
What was the dot, Kevin?

120
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:55,860
>> The initial derivative.

121
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,010
>> Right, the derivative as
seen by the inertial frames.

122
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,550
Immediately transport theorem, right,
we're going to have to use that a bunch.

123
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,029
And then the L?

124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,770
>> External torque.

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,300
>> The net external torque acting on it,
so motor torques don't go in that L.

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,876
Motor torques are internal systems,

127
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:11,841
where the spacecraft is being pushed
off relative to the gimbal frame.

128
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,684
And the gimbal frame pushes off
relative to the wheel frame,

129
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,110
those are internal torques.

130
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,140
They don't show up in that L that we had,
good.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,711
So, we went through this H dot=L,
how hard could that be, right?

132
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,473
And it's a lot of details,
a lot of book keeping.

133
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,970
So, some rigor is helpful here.

134
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,412
Just notationally, to review,
because we see the same,

135
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:35,161
[COUGH] excuse me, today,
gs is our spin axis of the wheel,

136
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:39,469
gt is the transverse axis then,
and gg, that's the gimbal axis.

137
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:43,199
So for gimbaling gamma dot,
wheel speed, big omega, all right,

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,720
that was kind of the rough breakdown.

139
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,850
We had the gimbal frame that we
actually used a lot in the derivation.

140
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,900
There's also body frame with a typical b1,
2, and 3, but you see in this system,

141
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,250
it tends to be easier to write
everything in the gimbal frame.

142
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,040
We have the angular velocities
of gimbal relative to the body,

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,880
wheel relative to gimbal, so
you can add, subtract them as needed.

144
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,703
And why was it in the end, if we assume
this gimbal frame is principle and

145
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:12,231
the wheel frame, we've picked one that
lines up with symmetry, it's principle,

146
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,925
why is it that the wheel inertia is
the same in the wheel frame as it is in

147
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:16,990
the gimbal frame?

148
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,640
What was the reason why that was case
because that's not generally true, right,

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,042
if you have two different frames?

150
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,750
And that's only true for IW, not for IG.

151
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,020
IG, if you look at this,
it has three distinct inertias.

152
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,940
IW has a spin axis inertia, and
then the two other inertias are the same.

153
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,290
>> Does the wheel inertia.

154
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,125
>> Because of the symmetry, exactly.

155
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:48,426
If you did the DCM, this is a rotation
between a wheel fixed frame and

156
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,920
the gimbal frame.

157
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,020
The only difference is the rotation
about the one axis, the GS, and

158
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,610
if you put in a DCM,
pretty imposed with the one axis rotation.

159
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,160
Because of the symmetry here,
you end up stuff that cancels,

160
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,980
and that doesn't matter in the end,
so you get the same thing.

161
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,910
And I show that in Mathematica
quickly without doing it by hand.

162
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,002
But that's a trick we use.

163
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,772
So that's why in the end,
we define the wheel frame, but

164
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:11,857
we never actually use it afterwards
once we get past this step.

165
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:16,797
And say well, the wheel tensor, we can
express it easily in a diagonal form also

166
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,590
with a G up here, instead of a W.

167
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,350
We went here, we took our DCM,
so if we have these three axes,

168
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,049
we did this kind of when we worked
with direction cosine matrices, right?

169
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:35,007
The BN matrix, you could write as
B1 transpose, B2, B3 as rows or N1,

170
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,599
2, and 3 as columns.

171
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,584
So instead of BN, we have BG, so

172
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,830
the G frames become the three
columns that you have.

173
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,020
We can express that.

174
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,290
If you then do the matrix math here, which
we did last time, you can write it as

175
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,230
the principle inertias times the outer
products of the base vectors.

176
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,150
It's a very convenient form,
because we know a lot of algebra on this.

177
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,140
Any questions on these things too?

178
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,030
If there's any questions on last material,
yes, Casey.

179
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,030
>> The gimbal frame is literally
the frame holding the wheel, right?

180
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,818
>> Yes, gimbal frame is this one here GG,
so this axis lines up always with that.

181
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:14,530
So, on a general CMG device, this is the
only one that's fixed as seen by the body.

182
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,770
That's where you bolt down the CMG.

183
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,640
But the other two axes as you gimbal,
so if this is my gimbal axis,

184
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,200
the GS axis of the wheel and the GT,
those are varying, they rotate about GG.

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,390
That's what's happening there, yep.

186
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,170
So GS, GG, and GT,
that's where they come from.

187
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,600
Good, so we went through that.

188
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,512
So now to get H,
as you were saying earlier,

189
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,330
H has to be the total angular
momentum of this dynamical system.

190
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,590
And here we have three
rigid body components.

191
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,608
We account for all of them.

192
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:45,780
Spacecraft to hub itself is easy,
that's just inertia tensor times omega BN,

193
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,812
we've done that before,
a single rigid body.

194
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,492
The gimbal frame has the same
kind of formulation,

195
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:55,684
the gimbal inertia times the angular
velocity of gimbal relative to inertial.

196
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:59,804
And we write that one as a sum of angular
velocity of gimbal relative to body

197
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:02,141
plus our typical body angular velocity.

198
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:06,497
And this one is nothing, but
gamma.tensor GG, and there was ways.

199
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:10,468
I showed you vector ways to do this math
or matrix ways, I actually think later,

200
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,240
here, we did matrix ways.

201
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,944
So this is kind of the core stuff
when you write these momentums,

202
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:17,412
just remember it has to be
relative to the inertial again.

203
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:20,383
You don't just put in the angular momentum
of the wheel relative to the body.

204
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,139
You need the full momentum of the system,
H dot = L,

205
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,060
inertial angular momentum that went there.

206
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,490
Good, run through this, then there was
a variety of derivatives we had to take,

207
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,300
which hopefully,
you could do with the transport theorem,

208
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,080
that was pretty straightforward.

209
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,780
The more interesting ones is
what were omega S, omega T, and

210
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,459
omega G, what were those omegas?

211
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,719
Usually, we have omega 1, 2,

212
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,207
and 3, which is the B1, 2,
and 3 frame component, right?

213
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:48,914
Kevin, do you remember?

214
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:53,940
>> The components of
the omega vector in G frame.

215
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,840
>> Yes, so the omega S is the GS component
of omega, and omega T is the GT,

216
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,560
so instead of using omega 1, 2,
we've taken the exact same omega vector.

217
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,210
Just instead of using the body frame,
we're using this gimbal frame.

218
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,610
We're breaking it up into three
different components, right?

219
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,192
And just convenient
because those transpose,

220
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,910
those mappings happened everywhere.

221
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,072
So now this is a scalar.

222
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,510
So Tebo, I think last time,
you answered this one.

223
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,595
Taking a derivative of the scalar,

224
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,290
with respect to what frame are we
taking this time derivative?

225
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,636
>> You don't take it with respect
to a frame, it's a scalar.

226
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:30,288
>> A scalar, but the scalar is
a product of a bunch of vectors,

227
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,680
a dot product essentially.

228
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,100
So over here,
what frame do you get to pick?

229
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,650
>> Whichever one you'd like.

230
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,090
>> But?
>> It has to be the same.

231
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,350
>> So if you have A times B,
you can't say,

232
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,810
well, I will take the Q
frame derivative of A.

233
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,470
And then later on,

234
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,070
if chain ruled the N frame derivative of
B, once you pick a frame across a product,

235
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,190
across a scalar part of that product,
you're pretty much committed, all right?

236
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,399
And this is if you do it inertial,
you can plug it in, and

237
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,548
I think I also showed last time that if
you did it in the body frame, for example,

238
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,100
or the gimbal frame,
that's another one you could pick.

239
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,806
You'll always get the same answer
as you would expect, all right?

240
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:09,661
So this was a good exercise of taking
derivatives of scalars since scalars

241
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:13,550
are a function of vectorial quantities,
to put that together.

242
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,020
So just definition for
today, you see this again.

243
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,520
J is nothing, but

244
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,300
the summation of the inertia of the frame
plus the wheel within the frame.

245
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,570
because these sums appear everywhere,
so we define J as that.

246
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,930
And then, yeah, the fun, which you did in
homework, there's some sub-results there.

247
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,240
We do all this, and
then the final definition is IS,

248
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,220
which is the inertia of the hub itself,
plus the inertia of the VSCMG combined,

249
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,970
gives us the spacecraft inertia.

250
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,313
So this one now, does this I
vary as seen by the body frame?

251
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,770
>> Yes.
>> Yeah, this one is fixed.

252
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,550
It's a rigid hub, but if this is
a variable speed CMG as you're gimbaling,

253
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,420
that wheel,
the mass distribution does change.

254
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,684
If you just had a reaction wheel,
does J vary as seen by the body,

255
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,525
if you only have a reaction wheel?

256
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:11,991
All right, no, because that wheel, even
though you're spinning it up and down,

257
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,770
because it's perfectly symmetric balanced,
there's no change in mass distribution.

258
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,670
One particle replaces the next particle.

259
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,335
So, anyway, so keep that in mind,
when you do these simulations,

260
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,370
in this case, you're not going to simulate
this in this class, but 6010, you would.

261
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,612
These are the things you would have to
update every time step, 6010 is fun.

262
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,580
There's some really interesting
code you're writing there.

263
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,310
You guys think estimation is bad,
you have no idea.

264
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,760
This is fun stuff.

265
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,260
So now we have our equations of motion,

266
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,370
this is kind of where we
ended up with last time.

267
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,830
This is a rigid spacecraft plus
a single VSCMG device, and

268
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,920
we still have the external
torques that act on it, right?

269
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,190
That's not motor torques,
that's gravity gradient torques or

270
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,400
radiation pressure, all this good stuff.

271
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,297
And as before, if it's a reaction wheel,
what all vanishes?

272
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,270
We'll see that again today.

273
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,228
What all goes to 0 if it's a reaction
wheel, instead of a VSCMG?

274
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,189
Endor?

275
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,741
>> Gamma dot terms?

276
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:10,520
>> Gamma dot, yeah, anything else?

277
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,010
Gamma double dot also goes to 0,
so this vanishes, this vanishes.

278
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,250
All this other stuff vanishes,
and in fact,

279
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,830
you get only this term,
you get this term and this term.

280
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,640
If you go back and look at your
dual spin equations of motion,

281
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,310
let me just put this up.

282
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,620
With the dual spin stuff,
you had exactly these same terms.

283
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,493
The one difference was,
we didn't have GS GT GG, there,

284
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:40,680
the dual spinner,
we lined up our wheel with B1.

285
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,480
But in essence, B1 then is GS,
all right, that is that axis.

286
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,840
So just make that replacement,
it's a 1 to 1 thing.

287
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,720
This is a slightly more general version,

288
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,680
where your wheel doesn't have
to line up with the B1 axis.

289
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,070
That's what we found.

290
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,040
If it is a CMG, Kevin,
how much simplifies?

291
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,630
>> You only get rid of
the omega [INAUDIBLE]

292
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,800
>> That's it, whoopdy do,

293
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,150
we're still left with 6 million terms.

294
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,560
So now,
especially when you have lots of CMG,

295
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,010
that's why you can see the mathematics of
CMGs, way more complicated right away.

296
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,269
In fact, if you have a dual spinner
constant speed, even this time goes to 0,

297
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,070
gets more simpler.

298
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,222
But this is where we ended up last time.
