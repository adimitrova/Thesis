now, were going to look
at how this all simplifies
if we have a single reaction wheel,
we mentioned earlier,
if you just have these all 
gimbal rates at zero,
gimbal acceleration is zero
that means this whole frame is
locked down, relative to the body,
these earlier equations
simplify to this form
and thats nice
so now, what we can do too
is you could rewrite this
were going to use the motor torque
equation to get rid of big omega dot
so im taking that extra differential
equation, im going to solve for
omega dot, back substitute it so
i get my spacecraft accelerations
in terms of the motor torque
one thing, i can show you this
in identity, this term here,
with a little bit of algebra, you can
show that it relates to omega cross gs
they just,
if you carry out the cross product terms,
thats what you come up with
so thats what i used to
replace this with this part
the next thing is this is the motor
torque equation without gimbaling, so
theres not gamma tau term in there
and thats good
and so you can see in here,
there is a js times big omega dot
js times big omega dot
i could then directly substitute this,
i can take js times this, bring it over
to the left hand side and substitute
this back up in here, i can do that
if you do that, you end up with
a term here thats going to be js
this is js times this,
youre still going to have a js over here,
gs, gs transposed omega dot
here we have the full
inertia tensor times this
and this inertia was the space
craft inertia plus the gimbal and
wheel frame inertia
so i is all of this plus js,
ts, gs transpose, as well
but since, when you substitute this
back in there, you get this extra term
its just like this last
term you have here
those two actually cancel
so, for the reaction wheel form that im
showing you, people often ignore this and
include that extra term,
which doesnt make momentum work
this will be the full answer
you can then, so redefining that, i can
rewrite these groups in terms a little
bit, but this is more the classic form
that you would see for reaction wheels
for reaction wheels we come up with
control loss that ill show one example of
then, where we come up with
torque level control loss
cmgs as i cover in , we dont come
up with motor torque level control loss
we come up with gimbal rates as
mario is pointing out right
we want to take advantage of that
gyroscopic torque as we twist
so we command a twist rate and
then you have a sub server system
that implements that twist rate
but thats bunch of
lectures in the future
so this is the classic
equation of motion of a wheel,
of the spacecraft with
a single reaction wheels
but oriented in a very general way, gs,
gt, dont have to line up with b one,
two and
three like we did with the dual spinner
thats what youd end up with in there,
so good
now thats a single device
if you do a single cmg, thats really
not much, as you guys mentioned earlier,
this one term vanishes, but
youre left with everything else
this is still the form that we use because
we dont solve for the motor torques,
we dont back substitute here
in fact, this is the term that gives
us the huge gyroscopic effect
the big omega times the small gimbal rate,
which is still a very
big torque acting on it
so, in fact, to control the valves of this
you find they come up with laws to come up
with these desired gimbal rates to give
you all the commanded steering and
gyroscopics
but this is the full
torque level solution
now weve done single vscmg devices
typically you dont fly a single one, we
fly clusters of four at least with vscmgs,
with reaction wheels you may have three,
four
ive seen some with six and more
just depends on, you might use
more than three for redundancy but
also maybe for torque
maybe a single wheel that you can get off
the shelf gives you one newton meter, but
your maneuvers require one and
a half newton meter
so you may double up on the wheels
just to get more bang there
so we have to deal with clusters,
systems of them
and in essence everything
weve done still holds
it just comes down to book keeping
problem if you have multiple wheels
then where we had one wheel,
that is going to be a gsi, right
the first gs axis, the second gs axis
the same thing for the transverse and
the gimbal, everything has  through n
and theres some convenient projection
matrices where im just making a three by
n matrix of the n number of cmg devices,
all the projections calculated
this inertia, it was before
the hub plus the single vscmg,
now list a hub plus a summation
of all those, all right
so we just carry out that
kind of a calculation
and the rest of the gyroscopic terms have
grouped this into these tau vectors
those are the gyroscopic terms and within
them theyre n by ones you will see
each one of these torques acts
about gs through gsn axes
and then the gt through gn axis,
and the gg one to the ggn axis
so it allows you to write in a little
bit more compact way, this way whereas
before, we had gs times all those terms
if you did it like this,
it would take you probably two pages
to write out every single term
so it allows you to cheat a little bit,
and just use some substitutions and
notations to simplify
so if you can do one wheel,
really doing multiple wheels
is just a bookkeeping problem
all the hard part is done, now i just
want to have a nice bookkeeping method
what we can look at for
examples too is kinetic energy
we have the kinetic energy that the hub,
great, and then you got the wheel
it has a spin rate relative to the body
and the wheel also can gimbal
so if you just go back and
look at omega w relative to n, it has
both big omega and gamma down in there
its inertia, the combined inertia system,
you can write this all out,
thats the kinetic energy
the beauty and you guys arent doing it
in this class,  gets to do this fun
but you take the derivatives of this,
plug in the equations of motion,
lots of algebra later
you come up with the same looking
power equation that weve had before
weve solved this power equation and
just for
the rotational part you proved that omega
dotted with l was the power that you have
if an external torque is acting on it
so the way you want to
look at this though,
this is kind of called
the workenergy principle
this torque is the torque that acts
on the body relative to inertia
youre pushing off with thrusters,
youre really pushing off inertial space,
so to speak with that
omega is body relative to inertia
big omega here, thats the wheel speed of
the wheel relative to the gimbal frame
us is the motor torque acting between
the wheel and the gimbal frame
little gamma dot is the angular velocity
between the gimbal frame and the body
and ug is the torque acting between
the gimbal frame and the body
this patterns holds, and
youll see this in a lot of
analytic dynamics text materials
once youve recognized it and
know how it gets there,
instead of taking this derivative and
getting there its really powerful
saves you lots of days of algebra
but anyway, so
we have a nice power expression even for
the really complicated
multi vscmg equation
we dont do much with it in this class,
but other classes you might see them
so the next step is now lets we
did the equations of motion for
a single reaction wheel
if we apply the same principle,
we have this irw,
instead of we only have to account for
the transverse and
gimbal axis directions of
the wheel inertia in this irw
but instead of just one,
we have n of them
so its just a summation again, right
we have this h vector
we saw this h vector with a dual spinner
at some point i defined
the momentum of the second,
the dual part,
relative to the body like that
and thats also appearing here
this is kind of a common notation
and you put this all together, with
a little bit of algebra, its not much
you can write now your
equations of motions and
nice matrix form where us is the stack,
the n by  of all the motor torques
and then you can get out of this
your angular rate of acceleration
the nice thing about this form is l dont
have big omega dot showing up anymore
l mean once l know what
the motor torques are,
l essentially decoupled these
two differential equations
l can get omega dot directly
and that same motor torque you applied
to the motor torque equations, and
then you know now what big omega dot is
you substitute it in as a known and
you get your big omega dots,
the wheel acceleration
so this gives you a way,
weve kind of analytically one
way solved the sets of equations
thats good
so thats if you have a system of them
a popular configuration of gs, thats
all the projection axis is you line up
the first wheel with b, the second wheel
with b and the third wheel with b
in that case,
this projection matrix is nothing but
 which is an identity matrix,
right
and then the gs just drop out and
you end up with this form
but this form is nice because if you even
try to do it perfectly with b what if
youre off by a degree or two
this form allows you to solve it in a much
more general way without that perfect
alignment assumption
but thats a differential equation where
we do control well use this particular
differential equation, and
come up with a control development
to do stabilizing that youll see
