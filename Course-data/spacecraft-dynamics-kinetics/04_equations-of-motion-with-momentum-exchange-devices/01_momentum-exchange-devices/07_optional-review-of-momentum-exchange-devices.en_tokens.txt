a
review
from
last
time
,
we
talked
about
momentum
controlled
devices
,
let
's
do
a
quick
thing
.
what
was
the
big
benefit
,
kevin
,
of
momentum
controlled
devices
versus
thrusters
to
do
attitude
control
?
>
>
can
have
a
more
precise
control
of
the
attitude
.
>
>
okay
,
i
mean
,
we
can
give
just
a
really
small
torques
on
it
.
though
that
's
slowly
changing
because
people
are
coming
up
with
very
interesting
micro
thrusters
that
can
also
do
nano
newton
meters
of
force
.
and
so
historically
that
's
been
precisely
true
,
10
,
20
years
from
now
,
we
'll
see
.
[
laugh
]
it
's
evolving
,
but
that
's
definitely
so
we
can
make
some
more
forces
.
what
else
,
mariel
?
>
>
you
do
n't
have
to
use
fuel
.
>
>
no
fuel
,
that
is
the
big
benefit
.
so
regardless
of
,
well
,
those
little
micro
devices
are
probably
very
efficient
,
they
may
not
take
much
fuel
.
but
it
's
still
a
finite
resource
.
versus
these
wheels
,
it
's
purely
electrical
.
part
of
that
is
a
motor
,
an
electric
motor
,
that
we
drive
.
you
give
it
a
voltage
,
it
spins
up
,
all
right
?
so
with
reaction
wheel
,
you
put
1
newton
meter
in
on
that
torque
,
you
get
1
newton
meter
back
.
it
's
a
1
to
1
relationship
,
which
is
nice
.
but
we
have
to
also
develop
the
motor
torque
equations
,
which
we
'll
do
today
.
what
we
did
last
time
was
developed
equations
of
motion
of
a
spacecraft
with
the
single
variables
b
,
c
,
and
g
,
or
at
least
,
i
outlined
how
you
develop
them
.
there
's
lots
of
little
steps
in
between
that
you
're
doing
.
but
so
today
too
,
we
need
extra
equations
of
motion
that
we
'll
talk
about
today
when
it
comes
together
.
what
is
the
benefit
of
a
cmg
device
then
compared
to
a
reaction
wheel
?
mandar
,
what
do
you
think
?
>
>
cmgs
use
a
high
spin
rate
,
which
stabilize
,
as
opposed
to
reaction
wheels
,
which
need
to
spin
.
>
>
so
it
's
the
highest
spin
,
what
gives
you
a
stability
?
>
>
no
,
sorry
,
they
use
high
spin
rate
to
generate
the
torque
.
>
>
generate
the
torque
,
exactly
.
there
's
a
huge
gyroscopic
coupling
.
if
your
wheel
is
spinning
quickly
,
and
my
arm
is
my
torque
vector
,
if
you
're
twisting
that
arm
,
you
're
changing
that
momentum
vector
.
and
h
dot
equal
to
l
,
a
change
in
momentum
,
must
be
a
torque
.
that
's
that
huge
gyroscopic
torque
that
can
be
taken
advantage
of
it
.
great
,
so
we
get
huge
torques
.
if
you
have
to
maneuver
very
quickly
or
maneuver
very
large
objects
,
like
space
stations
and
really
big
satellites
,
cmgs
are
definitely
preferred
.
otherwise
,
you
would
need
huge
wheels
.
what
's
the
challenge
with
reaction
wheels
though
?
they
're
simple
,
they
're
cheaper
,
what
's
the
big
issue
?
so
less
torque
,
right
,
but
what
else
?
>
>
so
there
can
be
static
dynamic
imbalance
of
the
wheel
.
>
>
i
did
n't
think
about
that
,
but
that
's
correct
.
you
could
have
an
imbalance
.
that
's
always
the
case
,
but
that
's
also
true
for
a
cmg
.
no
mechanical
device
is
ever
perfectly
balanced
,
all
right
?
so
and
a
cmg
actually
moving
at
a
very
high
frequency
is
going
to
give
you
this
very
high
frequency
jitter
that
you
just
have
to
make
sure
your
system
handles
,
and
it
's
not
an
issue
.
every
structure
kind
of
absorbs
some
of
that
jitter
,
acts
like
a
low-pass
filter
.
so
,
people
have
to
design
that
.
yeah
,
so
imbalances
,
if
you
're
doing
a
reaction
wheel
,
you
go
from
slow
speed
to
high
speed
.
and
you
go
through
all
the
frequencies
,
so
you
may
want
to
model
if
you
have
structural
residences
.
if
the
sense
of
platform
has
a
10
hertz
first
mode
stiffness
,
you
may
not
want
to
hang
out
at
10
hertz
a
long
time
with
a
wheel
.
because
you
would
be
exciting
that
frequency
.
so
there
might
be
things
like
that
to
consider
.
but
what
's
the
fundamental
challenge
?
why
ca
n't
we
just
use
reaction
wheels
and
apply
a
torque
indefinitely
?
andrew
.
>
>
desaturate
?
>
>
desaturate
,
right
,
at
some
point
,
you
physically
just
ca
n't
go
faster
.
the
bearings
break
down
,
there
might
be
heat
dissipation
issues
.
there
's
all
kinds
of
stuff
,
an
issue
.
so
with
cmgs
,
we
're
going
at
a
fixed
speed
nominally
.
so
i
do
n't
have
any
speed
limits
because
i
'm
just
running
at
a
fixed
speed
.
i
can
always
keep
twisting
.
what
is
the
problem
we
have
with
cmgs
then
?
casey
.
>
>
we
have
gimbal
lock
.
>
>
gimbal
lock
,
right
?
so
with
the
reaction
wheels
,
the
axis
about
which
we
produce
a
torque
is
fixed
as
seen
by
the
body
.
because
its
wheel
is
bolted
down
,
right
?
and
we
had
some
pictures
on
this
,
let
me
just
go
down
a
few
.
i
like
it
because
it
looks
beefy
,
it
's
really
bolted
down
,
this
spin
x
,
the
motor
axis
does
n't
change
as
seen
by
the
body
.
so
it
's
always
,
you
put
on
this
1
newton
meter
on
this
wheel
,
it
always
gives
you
a
torque
about
that
axis
,
no
matter
what
the
body
is
doing
.
versus
if
you
go
look
at
cmgs
,
which
we
had
here
,
now
,
this
is
our
spin
axis
.
but
then
there
's
a
gimbal
axis
,
and
that
varies
with
time
.
and
the
gyroscopics
we
were
hearing
about
earlier
,
that
's
always
about
that
transverse
axis
.
if
this
is
my
spin
axis
and
that
's
my
gimbal
axis
,
then
the
change
in
momentum
is
about
the
third
axis
,
that
's
the
gt
axis
we
called
.
and
that
axis
varies
as
you
gimbal
.
so
i
could
only
get
that
big
gyroscopic
torque
about
a
single
axis
.
and
what
can
happen
with
gimbal
lock
is
with
multiple
devices
,
those
axes
can
all
become
coplanar
.
in
fact
,
that
's
what
would
happen
if
you
would
just
go
there
,
take
the
spacecraft
,
and
an
astronaut
just
goes
there
and
keeps
pressing
against
it
,
just
to
be
an
irritant
,
that
spacecraft
will
hold
an
attitude
.
but
eventually
,
all
the
gimbals
will
line
up
,
such
that
all
the
gt
axes
are
orthogonal
to
that
torque
being
applied
.
and
then
you
have
gimbal
arc
,
and
everything
starts
tumbling
.
so
any
momentum
exchange
devices
has
some
momentum
limitations
in
terms
of
speeds
or
orientations
or
how
you
can
not
absorb
infinite
amount
of
momentum
onto
a
system
.
that
's
just
not
physically
possible
.
there
's
always
a
finite
limit
that
we
're
seeing
.
so
good
,
this
is
what
we
went
through
.
now
deriving
equations
of
motion
,
what
was
the
one
overriding
equation
that
drives
all
this
stuff
?

[

h
dot=l
,
so
casey
,
let
's
go
through
this
quickly
.
h
was
what
for
this
system
?
>

the
total
angular
momentum

of
the
dynamical
system
,
right
?
and
here
we
have
the
spacecraft
,
we
have
a
gimbal
structure
,
and
then
we
have
the
wheel
within
that
gimbal
structure
.
so
we
actually
have
three
components
.
what
was
the
dot
,
kevin
?

,

immediately
transport
theorem
,
right
,
we
're
going
to
have
to
use
that
a
bunch
.
and
then
the
l
?

external

.

the
net
external

acting
on
it
,
so
motor
torques
do
n't
go
in
that
l.
motor
torques
are
internal
systems
,
where
the
spacecraft
is
being
pushed
off
relative
to
the
gimbal
frame
.
and
the
gimbal
frame
pushes
off
relative
to
the
wheel
frame
,
those
are
internal
torques
.
they
do
n't
show
up
in
that
l
that
we
had
,
good
.
so
,
we
went
through
this
h
dot=l
,
how
hard
could
that
be
,
right
?
and
it
's
a
lot
of
details
,
a
lot
of
book
keeping
.
so
,
some
rigor
is
helpful
here
.
just
notationally
,
to
review
,
because
we
see
the
same
,
[
cough
]
excuse
me
,
today
,
gs
is
our
spin
axis
of
the
wheel
,
gt
is
the
transverse
axis
then
,
and
gg
,
that
's
the
gimbal
axis
.
so
for
gimbaling
gamma
dot
,
wheel
speed
,
big
omega
,
all
right
,
that
was
kind
of
the
rough
breakdown
.
we
had
the
gimbal
frame
that
we
actually
used
a
lot
in
the
derivation
.
there
's
also
body
frame
with
a
typical
b1
,
2
,
and
3
,
but
you
see
in
this
system
,
it
tends
to
be
easier
to
write
everything
in
the
gimbal
frame
.
we
have
the
angular
velocities
of
gimbal
relative
to
the
body
,
wheel
relative
to
gimbal
,
so
you
can
add
,
subtract
them
as
needed
.
and
why
was
it
in
the
end
,
if
we
assume
this
gimbal
frame
is
principle
and
the
wheel
frame
,
we
've
picked
one
that
lines
up
with
symmetry
,
it
's
principle
,
why
is
it
that
the
wheel
inertia
is
the
same
in
the
wheel
frame
as
it
is
in
the
gimbal
frame
?
what
was
the
reason
why
that
was
case
because
that
's
not
generally
true
,
right
,
if
you
have
two
different
frames
?
and
that
's
only
true
for
iw
,
not
for
ig
.
ig
,
if
you
look
at
this
,
it
has
three
distinct
inertias
.
iw
has
a
spin
axis
inertia
,
and
then
the
two
other
inertias
are
the
same
.
>
>
does
the
wheel
inertia
.
>
>
because
of
the
symmetry
,
exactly
.
if
you
did
the
dcm
,
this
is
a
rotation
between
a
wheel
fixed
frame
and
the
gimbal
frame
.
the
only
difference
is
the
rotation
about
the
one
axis
,
the
gs
,
and
if
you
put
in
a
dcm
,
pretty
imposed
with
the
one
axis
rotation
.
because
of
the
symmetry
here
,
you
end
up
stuff
that
cancels
,
and
that
does
n't
matter
in
the
end
,
so
you
get
the
same
thing
.
and
i
show
that
in
mathematica
quickly
without
doing
it
by
hand
.
but
that
's
a
trick
we
use
.
so
that
's
why
in
the
end
,
we
define
the
wheel
frame
,
but
we
never
actually
use
it
afterwards
once
we
get
past
this
step
.
and
say
well
,
the
wheel
tensor
,
we
can
express
it
easily
in
a
diagonal
form
also
with
a
g
up
here
,
instead
of
a
w.
we
went
here
,
we
took
our
dcm
,
so
if
we
have
these
three
axes
,
we
did
this
kind
of
when
we
worked
with
direction
cosine
matrices
,
right
?
the
bn
matrix
,
you
could
write
as
b1
transpose
,
b2
,
b3
as
rows
or
n1
,
2
,
and
3
as
columns
.
so
instead
of
bn
,
we
have
bg
,
so
the
g
frames
become
the
three
columns
that
you
have
.
we
can
express
that
.
if
you
then
do
the
matrix
math
here
,
which
we
did
last
time
,
you
can
write
it
as
the
principle
inertias
times
the
outer
products
of
the
base
vectors
.
it
's
a
very
convenient
form
,
because
we
know
a
lot
of
algebra
on
this
.
any
questions
on
these
things
too
?
if
there
's
any
questions
on
last
material
,
yes
,
casey
.
>
>
the
gimbal
frame
is
literally
the
frame
holding
the
wheel
,
right
?
>
>
yes
,
gimbal
frame
is
this
one
here
gg
,
so
this
axis
lines
up
always
with
that
.
so
,
on
a
general
cmg
device
,
this
is
the
only
one
that
's
fixed
as
seen
by
the
body
.
that
's
where
you
bolt
down
the
cmg
.
but
the
other
two
axes
as
you
gimbal
,
so
if
this
is
my
gimbal
axis
,
the
gs
axis
of
the
wheel
and
the
gt
,
those
are
varying
,
they
rotate
about
gg
.
that
's
what
's
happening
there
,
yep
.
so
gs
,
gg
,
and
gt
,
that
's
where
they
come
from
.
good
,
so
we
went
through
that
.
so
now
to
get
h
,
as
you
were
saying
earlier
,
h
has
to
be
the
total
angular
momentum
of
this
dynamical
system
.
and
here
we
have
three
rigid
body
components
.
we
account
for
all
of
them
.
spacecraft
to
hub
itself
is
easy
,
that
's
just
inertia
tensor
times
omega
bn
,
we
've
done
that
before
,
a
single
rigid
body
.
the
gimbal
frame
has
the
same
kind
of
formulation
,
the
gimbal
inertia
times
the
angular
velocity
of
gimbal
relative
to
inertial
.
and
we
write
that
one
as
a
sum
of
angular
velocity
of
gimbal
relative
to
body
plus
our
typical
body
angular
velocity
.
and
this
one
is
nothing
,
but
gamma.tensor
gg
,
and
there
was
ways
.
i
showed
you
vector
ways
to
do
this
math
or
matrix
ways
,
i
actually
think
later
,
here
,
we
did
matrix
ways
.
so
this
is
kind
of
the
core
stuff
when
you
write
these
momentums
,
just
remember
it
has
to
be
relative
to
the
inertial
again
.
you
do
n't
just
put
in
the
angular
momentum
of
the
wheel
relative
to
the
body
.
you
need
the
full
momentum
of
the
system
,
h
dot
=
l
,
inertial
angular
momentum
that
went
there
.
good
,
run
through
this
,
then
there
was
a
variety
of
derivatives
we
had
to
take
,
which
hopefully
,
you
could
do
with
the
transport
theorem
,
that
was
pretty
straightforward
.
the
more
interesting
ones
is
what
were
omega
s
,
omega
t
,
and
omega
g
,
what
were
those
omegas
?
usually
,
we
have
omega
1
,
2
,
and
3
,
which
is
the
b1
,
2
,
and
3
frame
component
,
right
?
kevin
,
do
you
remember
?
>
>
the
components
of
the
omega
vector
in
g
frame
.
>
>
yes
,
so
the
omega
s
is
the
gs
component
of
omega
,
and
omega
t
is
the
gt
,
so
instead
of
using
omega
1
,
2
,
we
've
taken
the
exact
same
omega
vector
.
just
instead
of
using
the
body
frame
,
we
're
using
this
gimbal
frame
.
we
're
breaking
it
up
into
three
different
components
,
right
?
and
just
convenient
because
those
transpose
,
those
mappings
happened
everywhere
.
so
now
this
is
a
scalar
.
so
tebo
,
i
think
last
time
,
you
answered
this
one
.
taking
a
derivative
of
the
scalar
,
with
respect
to
what
frame
are
we
taking
this
time
derivative
?

you
do
n't
take
it
with
respect
to
a
frame
,
it
's
a
scalar
.
>
>
a
scalar
,
but
the
scalar
is
a
product
of
a
bunch
of
vectors
,
a
dot
product
essentially
.
so
over
here
,
what
frame
do
you
get
to
pick
?

so
if
you
have
a
times
b
,
you
ca
n't
say
,
well
,
i
will
take
the
q
frame
derivative
of
a.
and
then
later
on
,
if
chain
ruled
the
n
frame
derivative
of
b
,
once
you
pick
a
frame
across
a
product
,
across
a
scalar
part
of
that
product
,
you
're
pretty
much
committed
,
all
right
?
and
this
is
if
you
do
it
inertial
,
you
can
plug
it
in
,
and
i
think
i
also
showed
last
time
that
if
you
did
it
in
the
body
frame
,
for
example
,
or
the
gimbal
frame
,
that
's
another
one
you
could
pick
.
you
'll
always
get
the
same
answer
as
you
would
expect
,
all
right
?
so
this
was
a
good
exercise
of
taking
derivatives
of
scalars
since
scalars
are
a
function
of
vectorial
quantities
,
to
put
that
together
.
so
just
definition
for
today
,
you
see
this
again
.
j
is
nothing
,
but
the
summation
of
the
inertia
of
the
frame
plus
the
wheel
within
the
frame
.
because
these
sums
appear
everywhere
,
so
we
define
j
as
that
.
and
then
,
yeah
,
the
fun
,
which
you
did
in
homework
,
there
's
some
sub-results
there
.
we
do
all
this
,
and
then
the
final
definition
is
is
,
which
is
the
inertia
of
the
hub
itself
,
plus
the
inertia
of
the
vscmg
combined
,
gives
us
the
spacecraft
inertia
.
so
this
one
now
,
does
this
i
vary
as
seen
by
the
body
frame
?
>
>
yes
.
>
>
yeah
,
this
one
is
fixed
.
it
's
a
rigid
hub
,
but
if
this
is
a
variable
speed
cmg
as
you
're
gimbaling
,
that
wheel
,
the
mass
distribution
does
change
.
if
you
just
had
a
reaction
wheel
,
does
j
vary
as
seen
by
the
body
,
if
you
only
have
a
reaction
wheel
?
all
right
,
no
,
because
that
wheel
,
even
though
you
're
spinning
it
up
and
down
,
because
it
's
perfectly
symmetric
balanced
,
there
's
no
change
in
mass
distribution
.
one
particle
replaces
the
next
particle
.
so
,
anyway
,
so
keep
that
in
mind
,
when
you
do
these
simulations
,
in
this
case
,
you
're
not
going
to
simulate
this
in
this
class
,
but
6010
,
you
would
.
these
are
the
things
you
would
have
to
update
every
time
step
,
6010
is
fun
.
there
's
some
really
interesting
code
you
're
writing
there
.
you
guys
think
estimation
is
bad
,
you
have
no
idea
.
this
is
fun
stuff
.
so
now
we
have
our
equations
of
motion
,
this
is
kind
of
where
we
ended
up
with
last
time
.
this
is
a
rigid
spacecraft
plus
a
single
vscmg
device
,
and
we
still
have
the
external
torques
that
act
on
it
,
right
?
that
's
not
motor
torques
,
that
's
gravity
gradient
torques
or
radiation
pressure
,
all
this
good
stuff
.
and
as
before
,
if
it
's
a
reaction
wheel
,
what
all
vanishes
?
we
'll
see
that
again
today
.
what
all
goes
to
0
if
it
's
a
reaction
wheel
,
instead
of
a
vscmg
?
endor
?
>
>
gamma
dot
terms
?
>
>
gamma
dot
,
yeah
,
anything
else
?
gamma
double
dot
also
goes
to
0
,
so
this
vanishes
,
this
vanishes
.
all
this
other
stuff
vanishes
,
and
in
fact
,
you
get
only
this
term
,
you
get
this
term
and
this
term
.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
your
dual
spin
equations
of
motion
,
let
me
just
put
this
up
.
with
the
dual
spin
stuff
,
you
had
exactly
these
same
terms
.
the
one
difference
was
,
we
did
n't
have
gs
gt
gg
,
there
,
the
dual
spinner
,
we
lined
up
our
wheel
with
b1
.
but
in
essence
,
b1
then
is
gs
,
all
right
,
that
is
that
axis
.
so
just
make
that
replacement
,
it
's
a
1
to
1
thing
.
this
is
a
slightly
more
general
version
,
where
your
wheel
does
n't
have
to
line
up
with
the
b1
axis
.
that
's
what
we
found
.
if
it
is
a
cmg
,
kevin
,
how
much
simplifies
?

>
you
only
get
rid
of
the
omega
[
inaudible
]
>
>
that
's
it
,
whoopdy
do
,
we
're
still
left
with
6
million
terms
.
so
now
,
especially
when
you
have
lots
of
cmg
,
that
's
why
you
can
see
the
mathematics
of
cmgs
,
way
more
complicated
right
away
.
in
fact
,
if
you
have
a
dual
spinner
constant
speed
,
even
this
time
goes
to
0
,
gets
more
simpler
.
but
this
is
where
we
ended
up
last
time
.
