hi, welcome to fourth 
segment space craft kinetics 
here, going to looking 
complex equations motion that you 
a rigid space craft 
it, we a series fly 
wheels momentum exchange devices 
well first studying 
different types devices 
theres reaction wheels, 
theres control moment gyroscopes, 
theres also variable speed cmgs 
well develop math 
well actually develop math in a 
complicated way general way 
variable speed 
control moment gyroscope 
ill show you you 
could simplify equations 
to retain classical cmg 
reactional equations motion 
so this is a great classical treatment, 
reaction wheels used very, 
generally spacecraft 
big benefit is 
need electrical energy, 
theres thrust involved 
to attitude 
thing control 
moment gyroscopes, 
theyre expensive, 
produce much bigger torques 
yes, 
you will see in mathematics 
also give you headaches 
much mathematics 
so a lot fun
