okay, so lets talk control moment devices, here 
theyre popular 
we like reaction wheels, cmgs 
brian 
youve heard devices right 
yeah robustness 
robust 
i dont know theres 
a spinning wheel a whole lot 
we that discussion this morning 
yeah youve heard kepler mission 
alright, that thing that failed, is this spinning wheels 
a spinning wheel fail 
well, never quite 
you know, is that 
right others might argue that a kurd area 
research example micro thrusters, 
theres a lot people coming 
small little ppt thrusters polaroid thrusters that put in milli newton, 
micro newton so that otherwise if you bigger thrusters 
one newton nothing 
a lot controls you need like you know 
million newton meters newton meters 
so thrusters way rough in 
devices give you 
subtle forces is nice precision pointing if you think kepler 
to stare carefully sky 
dont want this rough actuation 
want a really gentle subtle thing 
devices give you that kind a call control bandwidth right 
dont i half quarter 
i get infinitesimally smooth a nice voltage based motor 
so so that is good 
simpler devices 
whats other, benefits that we could 
momentum exchange devices 
redundancy 
you might redundancy, 
you could also redundancy thrusters if you wanted to, right yeah daniel 
you dont use fuel 
you dont use fuel, right 
in space, fuel is everything 
if you look control solutions that we develop 
often we to careful that fighting gravity time 
you know, whatever nature is if sole pressures trying to tilt to 
five degrees you go i want to vertical youre fighting that 
that that torque time 
that means wheels going to spin you using fuel 
continuously you know thats a bad thing in space, 
so we always look ways to one, 
much one nature possible 
right, we cant afford to anything else 
so thats a important point 
momentum exchange devices dont use fuel 
use electrical energy 
electrical energy long solar panels there properly 
deployed you know there 
little conditions you run this indefinitely 
whats challenge you go pluto 
you think you could still use reaction wheels pluto spencer 
suns going to strong to generate enough electricity to power 
so new horizons attitude control 
electric an rtg 
so you still reaction wheels 
you could reaction wheels i actually dont 
know if new horizons used thrusters reaction wheels 
im guessing reaction wheels board, 
youd to a different energy source 
right still, okay 
infinite like a solar panel highly highly efficient 
so even in deep space applications wheels quite nice 
you know we means generating electricity 
far easily tons tons fuel 
you know you stash energy replenish energy 
rtgs much compact that fuel 
that to last years to that 
so thats big benefit 
right, momentum exchange devises challenges though 
you think 
zero crossings 
used to so there is stickage 
i talk manufacturers this you go look specs 
go zero crossings naah thats so old school 
we dont worry that anymore 
get good enough issue we talked stickage 
if you go slow enough a sudden you 
want to cross zero a nice spinoff prescribed rate 
you get close enough a sudden goes uhh 
basically sticks you to give enough force to unstick 
gives you that slight wobble that kepler really would hate 
you know, so you might to worry 
zero crossing theyre getting really good things 
so that becomes less an issue onesryan

russell 
despinning wheel 
momentum management 
thats something well keep talking 
so in equation we developed you will see, 
hey this works this works infinitely 
keep in mind wheel speeds 
in mathematics actually grow infinitely large 
in reality you cant that 
wheel will literally fall apart point 
spinning so fast 
issues that you devices 
momentum management, will true cmgs reaction wheels 
we dont cover much in this class follow goes 
way detail momentum management a whole complexity 
cmgcos singularities if line 
right usually comes momentum management issues there also 
controllability problems that sometimes 
devices you may able to produce general torques 
so theres classic cmg singularity that we must to talk 
im going to show here dont go, 
running time details 
goes in way details this stuff, 
yeah appear 
also you basically got this washing machine right, 
something thats shaking rattling going around 
balanced is that wheel typically 
pretty good hopefully 
is perfectly balanced 
right, never nothing in life is absolutely perfectly balanced 
so youre actually you know like a little imbalanced mass 
faster youre spinning youre putting continuously 
a slight shake disturbance craft frequency wheel 
so if you consider internal modes fuel slosh 
panels that might flexing 
structural resonances sense platform to steady you want to 
stare stars kepler 
a certain natural frequency if you hit that natural frequency wheels, 
you might exciting a little bit you want it, you know 
so you to worry things, 
so balancing stuff 
modeling in bound in class an perfectly balanced 
in modeling one current students 
publishing papers in full stuff 
amazing this little one motor torque equation that takes this much space, 
takes like a page a sudden 
if you full model 
so theres papers, if youre curious i point you to 
so big benefits, fuel thats really biggest thing also fine tune control 
thats really important if you to 
a smidgen left you know kind control 
theres challenges devices mathematics 
so this is typically look like this is a simple reaction wheel, 
basically spinning discs, 
a blob mass, electronics something that holds together in case breaks 
you dont want to smash everything else becomes a bomb essentially 
so to hold together a material reaction wheels, 
key is this is bolted 
i like this picture looks kind beefy you know 
remember this wheel is bolted 
in mathematics a reaction wheel well always 
assume that axes fixed 
spin axis doesnt, 
you know change respect to body 
so we body fixed spin axis 
you multiple wheels to generate arbitrary torque 
wheel you get to a torque spin axis 
you apply one newton meter torque 
you get a minus newton meter torque back onto craft right, newtons laws 
you push one newton you get pushback back one newton 
thats principle 
there is amplification theres nothing to generate 
a general three dimensional torque vector 
you didnt to go this one to produce meter, 
this one , this one you spin particular ways 
right well see that in mathematics 
we arrange these, 
a torque command onto wheel speed commands 
saturate 
wheel spin infinitely fast thats a problem 
to apply a torque to spinning wheel 
so if youre persistently pushing craft like atmospheric drag might 
youre holding an attitude thats in equilibrium that drag, 
youre pushing back wheels to hold attitude 
that means continuously youre spinning that wheel 
point goes okay, 
im done im taking 
we may run heat issues 
heat an issue well 
ones to look like this 
here ithaco ones 
might that flying kepler 
often look pancake shaped 
high end wheels often look like a pancake 
make skinny, long like a cork bar something 
you kind put big rod wheel there you think 
bigger torque 
sorry 
you a bigger torque speed 
technically correct motor torque, 
whatever that motor produces thats a torque you get back craft 
pressure is outside 
inertia is big thing bigger, 
you put wheel inertia, 
wheel mass bigger inertia is going to 
so if you look d rotation you 
i times anglular acceleration equal to torque, 
angular acceleration will smaller 
if you inertia 
right if a beefier wheel that means 
inertia you put newton meter torque there 
youre going to spin much 
that means dont saturate quickly thats a nice thing 
youre still storing amount momentum, 
torque times time gives you momentum 
so momentum we store you will find 
every one wheels introduces new gyroscopics 
dual spinner, 
we looked wheel speed we that 
gyroscopics actually help us if youre evil, 
dont help you destabilize it, right 
theres that you this stuff 
well see effects happening in a general wheel configuration 
right so momentum you makes really stable 
if you to point here point here 
quickly momentum will work you 
stable is harder is sometimes to move 
thats stability gives you 
thats things flat 
we so much mass give you kilograms 
best you is a ring kilograms way 
in reality you need something around to hold together 
you need thin spokes to hold together 
you need enough stiffness so things dont vibrate like crazy 
you know start modes that get excited 
so theres always a tradeoff you like much mass possible 
that gets you inertia mass that youre allocated this device 
good if you look inside you see basically this 
mass is here 
this one happens to a flat 
a thin kind thing that comes out, certain shapes 
this is structural purposes 
youre looking resonances, 
trying to make a hyper stable wheel 
you dont want this thing to beat balance washing machine thing 
so a lot effort goes that theyre getting really good days 
there is always electronics that drives 
analog many them, 
cool ones ive seen germany days digital 
you basically give a command everything, tracks friction, 
tracks zero crossing, 
tracks heat, if gets hot automatically cuts 
so there really nice call smart 
reaction wheels that weve seen there 
you find web honeywell makes also, 
a huge reactionary manufacturer that make a lot devices 
control moment gyroscope look similar 
pancake that means weve got a spinning disk 
we want much inertia possible theres 
still a motor in here actually that controls wheel speed, 
in fact none devices launch start like dual spinner 
youre in craft bolted down, 
youre there you to figure 
i spin this whole system right 
so a cmg, whats different a reaction wheel, 
a reaction wheel, ideally youd like to around 
zero speed ish least a low speed 
higher speed you will see 
a motor torque equation weve seen work energy principle already 
will cause power required so we want speeds low 
a cmg, we want a high speed thing 
that drives us here is motor torque actually gyroscopic effect 
im assuming youve done this experiment bicycle wheel you spin up, 
right, you tilt you get this weird kick in another direction right 
thats really gyroscopic effect if you 
spun like this you get momentum vector sticking 
you tilt it, youve changed momentum, 
changed momentum is torque 
so thats actually going to spin you this orthogonal axes 
right thats taking advantage 
so spinning a, 
you know rpm 
smaller ones going way even, 
a high need to balanced carefully designed 
immediately, that means money one devices 
you a motor that gets you to that speed holds roughly that speed 
theres a second motor here thats 
new part that allows that spinning wheel to gimbaled 
thats call gimbaling angle 
much you gimbel if this is spin axis wheel, 
we gimbel this, 
you know youre changing spin axis relative to body 
so we derivatives there will body relative derivatives in cmg 
right a reaction wheel, there 
so big benefit here youll see in mathematics is actually 
torque amplification small input torques 
allow you to get a large torque back thing 
so that small input really youre taking advantage is 
gyroscopic that happens so faster wheel is spinning 
bigger gyroscopic will that input 
you put in one penny get a dollar so to speak, you know 
thats great if you huge things to move, big satellites 
might take huge reaction wheels to move you 
way better a cmg device 
space station actually uses 
double gimballed cmg clusters to kind hold attitude stuff 
double gimballing benefits, 
momentum absorption capability 
devices you see like this single gimballed, 
a single axis a double, 
you know, gyrating axis 
that makes even complicated 
so drawbacks, definitely mechanically complex 
controls definitely much complicated 
you will see in equations motion we go 
variable speed cmg to classic cmg 
a classic cmg holds wheel speed 
constant versus variable allows you to go place 
doesnt simplify much 
still really complicated to really complicated 
you know, good to reaction wheels becomes actually quite doable 
so mathematics is def, 
trickier, singularities mentioning 
youre getting a torque thats orthogonal to this axis 
spin axis so that third axis actually varies time 
so depending youre you get things to 
line in a plane is a singularity youre talking 
if controls i need a torque that plane you cant produce that 
thats gimble lock, 
kind a consideration 
so well see hints that in mathematics that come singularities 
so good look theyre 
you dont typically fly one device so you clusters cmgs, 
often four clusters four 
nice thing is you wheel momentum 
wheel is spinning lets say rpm, 
thats an easy number you align in a way that two wheels 
pointing so outward parts cancel upwards part add 
two wheels pointing downwards in direction 
total momentum fourth cmg cluster is zero normally, 
thats nice zero momentum means i stay agile 
momentum i like we saw dual spinners, 
you get stable also means you 
become lethargic takes a huge effort to 
drag that momentum space that takes a huge torque to that 
so people like this agility purposes 
you reaction wheels you need three 
you four reaction wheels, 
tetrahedron configurations you set 
a system that a nominal zero momentum device 
so so theres whole lectures we to configure things 
thats kind look like in clusters 
well typically in class, 
youll see pictures mimics this one, 
pyramid cmg cluster 
also popular configuration reaction wheels
