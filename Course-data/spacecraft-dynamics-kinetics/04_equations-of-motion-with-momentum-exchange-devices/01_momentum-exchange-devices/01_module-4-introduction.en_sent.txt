hi, and welcome to the fourth segment of space craft kinetics.
here, we're going to be looking at the complex equations of motion that you have of a rigid space craft.
but on it, we now have a series of fly wheels or other momentum exchange devices.
we'll be first studying the different types of devices.
there's reaction wheels, there's control moment gyroscopes, and then there's also variable speed cmgs.
and then we'll develop the math.
we'll actually develop the math in a more complicated way than most general way with the variable speed control moment gyroscope.
and then i'll show you how you could simplify these equations to retain the classical cmg and reactional equations of motion.
so this is a great classical treatment, reaction wheels are used very, very generally on spacecraft.
their big benefit is they only need electrical energy, there's no thrust involved to do the attitude.
same thing with control moment on the gyroscopes, they're more expensive, but they produce much bigger torques.
and yes, as you will see in the mathematics.
they also give you more headaches and much more mathematics.
so it's a lot of fun.
