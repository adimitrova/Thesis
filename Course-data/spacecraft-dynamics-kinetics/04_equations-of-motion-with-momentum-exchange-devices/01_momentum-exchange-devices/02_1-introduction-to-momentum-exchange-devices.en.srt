1
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:10,040
We're going to be talking about
momentum exchange devices.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,780
This still belongs to the category of

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,250
kinetics in the sense that we're
trying to find equations of motion.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,572
We have found equations of motion and
you started that with blobs,

5
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,660
let me frozen so
we have a nice rigid body.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,480
Then we found them for a single rigid
body, studied equilibrium, stability,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,210
all the uncontrolled things.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,946
Then we had systems of rigid bodies
where we had maybe a dual spinner, so

9
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,393
it was a craft in one wheel.

10
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,800
Now we're going to go a little bit crazy
here, not just do craft in one wheel but

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,260
craft in n wheels.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,170
And not just body fixed wheels but
even ones that can spin and

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,710
twist relative to the body.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,990
Those things are called
controlled mono gyroscopes.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,560
So with all these extra things
there's benefits but also challenges.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,280
The mathematics gets a lot more complex.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,530
So in your last homework actually you
derived these in via CNG equations,

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,740
the path is all in the book.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,060
We're covering everything in class, so

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,160
as we go through these I'm
going to show you some highlights.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,610
Maybe go through some of these equations.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,380
Show you how you can get
from this step to this step.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,770
But I'm not going to do every
single mathematical detail.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,763
You do that actually at the end when you
put it back yourself in the homework.

25
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:14,150
But then you see all the sub steps.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,880
You can see yep this is
what I should be getting.

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,720
Great I'm on track.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,570
If you're stuck with a sub step you can
use the next sub step and move on, right?

29
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,830
And then come back to that
one later if you have to.

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,960
So everything's there.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,590
So the way I'm teaching
this is more of a overview.

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,380
We want to cover the topics and
concepts and how this comes together.

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,660
So we'll talk about
momentum control devices.

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,970
There's some pictures and
just conceptually why do people like this?

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,074
It's kind of an icing.

36
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,663
And then we can get into
the math equations of motion and

37
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:45,190
we're going to derive it
in the most general way.

38
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,302
There's something called verbal
speed control moment gyroscope.

39
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:52,697
Typically there's just CMG's
within a single axis or dual axis,

40
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,582
double gamble CNG devices.

41
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,642
But there are also some that have been
researched that have been variable speed

42
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,250
and you'll see the benefits.

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,500
If we do a variable speed
control moment job scope upfront

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,825
we're doing the most complex version.

45
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,701
And then at the end we can go well,
what if it is just a reaction mill?

46
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,245
What if it is a CMG?

47
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:14,000
So we can free certain modes in the
mathematics and certain terms go to zero.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,998
And you regain the classic reactional
solution or CMG solution or the hybrid,

49
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:19,837
right?

50
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:23,017
So instead of doing this two, three times,
we'll do it once in the most general and

51
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,247
then specialize.

52
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,137
That's the approach that we're doing.

53
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:30,847
So we'll go through a single VSCMG first,
talk about the motor torque calculations.

54
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,857
Clusters often too,
that's we have multiple devices.

55
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:35,256
Basically comes to summation,

56
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,905
once you know how to do one doing
the others is kind of a ditto.

57
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:41,288
It's more of a bookkeeping step so
it doesn't take long to do that.
