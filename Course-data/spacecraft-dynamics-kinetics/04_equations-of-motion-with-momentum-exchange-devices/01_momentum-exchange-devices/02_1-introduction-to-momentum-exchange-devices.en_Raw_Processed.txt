going to talking 
momentum exchange devices 
this still belongs to category 
kinetics in sense that 
trying to find equations motion 
we found equations motion 
you started that blobs, 
let frozen so 
we a nice rigid body 
we found a single rigid 
body, studied equilibrium, stability, 
uncontrolled things 
we systems rigid bodies 
we maybe a dual spinner, so 
a craft in one wheel 
going to go a little bit crazy 
here, craft in one wheel 
craft in n wheels 
body fixed wheels 
even ones that spin 
twist relative to body 
things called 
controlled mono gyroscopes 
so extra things 
theres benefits also challenges 
mathematics gets a lot complex 
so in last homework actually you 
derived in via cng equations, 
path is in book 
covering everything in class, so 
we go im 
going to show you highlights 
maybe go equations 
show you you get 
this step to this step 
im going to every 
single mathematical detail 
you that actually end you 
put back in homework 
you see sub steps 
you see yep this is 
i getting 
great im track 
if youre stuck a sub step you 
use next sub step move on, right 
come back to that 
one later if you to 
so everythings there 
so way im teaching 
this is a overview 
we want to cover topics 
concepts this comes together 
so well talk 
momentum control devices 
theres pictures 
conceptually people like this 
kind an icing 
we get 
math equations motion 
going to derive 
in general way 
theres something called verbal 
speed control moment gyroscope 
typically theres cmgs 
within a single axis dual axis, 
double gamble cng devices 
there also that 
researched that variable speed 
youll see benefits 
if we a variable speed 
control moment job scope upfront 
complex version 
end we go well, 
if is a reaction mill 
if is a cmg 
so we free certain modes in 
mathematics certain terms go to zero 
you regain classic reactional 
solution cmg solution hybrid, 
right 
so instead this two, three times, 
well in general 
specialize 
thats approach that 
so well go a single vscmg first, 
talk motor torque calculations 
clusters often too, 
thats we multiple devices 
basically comes to summation, 
you know to one 
others is kind a ditto 
a bookkeeping step so 
doesnt take long to that
