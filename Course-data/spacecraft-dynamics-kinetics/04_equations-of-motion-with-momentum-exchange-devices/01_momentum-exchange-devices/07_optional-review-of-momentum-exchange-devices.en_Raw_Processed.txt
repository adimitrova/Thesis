a review last time, we talked 
momentum controlled devices, 
lets a quick thing 
big benefit, kevin, 
momentum controlled devices versus 
thrusters to attitude control 
a precise 
control attitude 
okay, i mean, we give 
a really small torques 
though thats slowly changing 
people coming 
interesting micro thrusters that 
also nano newton meters force 
so historically thats precisely 
true, , years now, well see 
laugh evolving, 
thats definitely so 
we make forces 
else, mariel 
you dont to use fuel 
fuel, that is big benefit 
so regardless of, well, little micro 
devices probably efficient, 
may take much fuel 
still a finite resource 
versus wheels, 
purely electrical 
part that is a motor, 
an electric motor, that we drive 
you give a voltage, 
spins up, right 
so reaction wheel, 
you put newton meter in that torque, 
you get newton meter back 
a to relationship, is nice 
we to also develop motor 
torque equations, well today 
we last time developed 
equations motion a spacecraft 
single variables b, c, g, 
least, i outlined you develop 
theres lots little steps 
in between that youre 
so today too, we need extra equations 
motion that well talk 
today comes together 
is benefit a cmg device 
compared to a reaction wheel 
mandar, you think 
cmgs use a high spin rate, 
stabilize, 
opposed to reaction wheels, 
need to spin 
so highest spin, 
gives you a stability 
no, sorry, use high spin 
rate to generate torque 
generate torque, exactly 
theres a huge gyroscopic coupling 
if wheel is spinning quickly, 
arm is torque vector, 
if youre twisting that arm, 
youre changing that momentum vector 
h dot equal to l, 
a change in momentum, must a torque 
thats that huge gyroscopic torque 
that taken advantage 
great, so we get huge torques 
if you to maneuver quickly 
maneuver large objects, 
like space stations really big 
satellites, cmgs definitely preferred 
otherwise, you would need huge wheels 
whats challenge 
reaction wheels though 
theyre simple, theyre cheaper, 
whats big issue 
so less torque, right, else 
so there static 
dynamic imbalance wheel 
i didnt think that, 
thats correct 
you could an imbalance 
thats always case, 
thats also true a cmg 
mechanical device is ever 
perfectly balanced, right 
so a cmg actually moving a 
high frequency is going to give you this 
high frequency jitter that you 
to make sure system handles, 
an issue 
every structure kind absorbs 
that jitter, acts like a lowpass filter 
so, people to design that 
yeah, so imbalances, 
if youre a reaction wheel, 
you go slow speed to high speed 
you go frequencies, so 
you may want to model if you 
structural residences 
if sense platform 
a hertz first mode stiffness, 
you may want to hang 
hertz a long time a wheel 
you would 
exciting that frequency 
so there might things 
like that to consider 
whats fundamental challenge 
cant we use reaction wheels 
apply a torque indefinitely 
andrew 
desaturate 
desaturate, right, point, 
you physically cant go faster 
bearings break down, 
there might heat dissipation issues 
theres kinds stuff, an issue 
so cmgs, 
going a fixed speed nominally 
so i dont speed limits 
im running a fixed speed 
i always keep twisting 
is problem we 
cmgs 
casey 
we gimbal lock 
gimbal lock, right 
so reaction wheels, 
axis we produce 
a torque is fixed seen body 
wheel is bolted down, right 
we pictures this, 
let go a few 
i like looks beefy, 
really bolted down, 
this spin x, motor axis doesnt 
change seen body 
so always, you put this 
newton meter this wheel, 
always gives you a torque that 
axis, matter body is 
versus if you go look cmgs, we 
here, now, this is spin axis 
theres a gimbal axis, 
that varies time 
gyroscopics we 
hearing earlier, 
thats always that transverse axis 
if this is spin axis 
thats gimbal axis, 
change in momentum is 
third axis, thats gt axis we called 
that axis varies you gimbal 
so i could get that big 
gyroscopic torque a single axis 
happen gimbal 
lock is multiple devices, 
axes become coplanar 
in fact, thats would happen 
if you would go there, 
take spacecraft, an astronaut 
goes there keeps pressing it, 
to an irritant, 
that spacecraft will hold an attitude 
eventually, 
gimbals will line up, 
that gt axes orthogonal 
to that torque applied 
you gimbal arc, 
everything starts tumbling 
so momentum exchange devices 
momentum limitations in terms speeds 
orientations you cannot absorb 
infinite amount momentum onto a system 
thats physically possible 
theres always a finite 
limit that seeing 
so good, this is we went 
deriving equations motion, 
one overriding equation 
that drives this stuff 
inaudible 
h dotl, so casey, 
lets go this quickly 
h this system 
total angular momentum 
dynamical system, right 
here we spacecraft, 
we a gimbal structure, 
we wheel within 
that gimbal structure 
so we actually three components 
dot, kevin 
initial derivative 
right, derivative 
seen inertial frames 
immediately transport theorem, right, 
going to to use that a bunch 
l 
external torque 
net external torque acting it, 
so motor torques dont go in that l 
motor torques internal systems, 
spacecraft is pushed 
relative to gimbal frame 
gimbal frame pushes 
relative to wheel frame, 
internal torques 
dont show in that l that we had, 
good 
so, we went this h dotl, 
hard could that be, right 
a lot details, 
a lot book keeping 
so, rigor is helpful here 
notationally, to review, 
we see same, 
cough excuse me, today, 
gs is spin axis wheel, 
gt is transverse axis then, 
gg, thats gimbal axis 
so gimbaling gamma dot, 
wheel speed, big omega, right, 
that kind rough breakdown 
we gimbal frame that we 
actually used a lot in derivation 
theres also body frame a typical b, 
, , you see in this system, 
tends to easier to write 
everything in gimbal frame 
we angular velocities 
gimbal relative to body, 
wheel relative to gimbal, so 
you add, subtract needed 
in end, if we assume 
this gimbal frame is principle 
wheel frame, weve picked one that 
lines symmetry, principle, 
is that wheel inertia is 
in wheel frame is in 
gimbal frame 
reason that case 
thats generally true, right, 
if you two different frames 
thats true iw, ig 
ig, if you look this, 
three distinct inertias 
iw a spin axis inertia, 
two inertias 
wheel inertia 
symmetry, exactly 
if you dcm, this is a rotation 
between a wheel fixed frame 
gimbal frame 
difference is rotation 
one axis, gs, 
if you put in a dcm, 
pretty imposed one axis rotation 
symmetry here, 
you end stuff that cancels, 
that doesnt matter in end, 
so you get thing 
i show that in mathematica 
quickly without hand 
thats a trick we use 
so thats in end, 
we define wheel frame, 
we never actually use afterwards 
we get past this step 
say well, wheel tensor, we 
express easily in a diagonal form also 
a g here, instead a w 
we went here, we took dcm, 
so if we three axes, 
we this kind we worked 
direction cosine matrices, right 
bn matrix, you could write 
b transpose, b, b rows n, 
, columns 
so instead bn, we bg, so 
g frames become three 
columns that you 
we express that 
if you matrix math here, 
we last time, you write 
principle inertias times outer 
products base vectors 
a convenient form, 
we know a lot algebra this 
questions things 
if theres questions last material, 
yes, casey 
gimbal frame is literally 
frame holding wheel, right 
yes, gimbal frame is this one here gg, 
so this axis lines always that 
so, a general cmg device, this is 
one thats fixed seen body 
thats you bolt cmg 
two axes you gimbal, 
so if this is gimbal axis, 
gs axis wheel gt, 
varying, rotate gg 
thats whats happening there, yep 
so gs, gg, gt, 
thats come 
good, so we went that 
so to get h, 
you saying earlier, 
h to total angular 
momentum this dynamical system 
here we three 
rigid body components 
we account 
spacecraft to hub is easy, 
thats inertia tensor times omega bn, 
weve done that before, 
a single rigid body 
gimbal frame 
kind formulation, 
gimbal inertia times angular 
velocity gimbal relative to inertial 
we write that one a sum angular 
velocity gimbal relative to body 
plus typical body angular velocity 
this one is nothing, 
gammatensor gg, there ways 
i showed you vector ways to this math 
matrix ways, i actually think later, 
here, we matrix ways 
so this is kind core stuff 
you write momentums, 
remember to 
relative to inertial 
you dont put in angular momentum 
wheel relative to body 
you need full momentum system, 
h dot l, 
inertial angular momentum that went there 
good, run this, there 
a variety derivatives we to take, 
hopefully, 
you could transport theorem, 
that pretty straightforward 
interesting ones is 
omega s, omega t, 
omega g, omegas 
usually, we omega , , 
, is b, , 
frame component, right 
kevin, you remember 
components 
omega vector in g frame 
yes, so omega is gs component 
omega, omega is gt, 
so instead using omega , , 
weve taken exact omega vector 
instead using body frame, 
using this gimbal frame 
breaking three 
different components, right 
convenient 
transpose, 
mappings happened everywhere 
so this is a scalar 
so tebo, i think last time, 
you answered this one 
taking a derivative scalar, 
respect to frame we 
taking this time derivative 
you dont take respect 
to a frame, a scalar 
a scalar, scalar is 
a product a bunch vectors, 
a dot product essentially 
so here, 
frame you get to pick 
whichever one youd like 

to 
so if you a times b, 
you cant say, 
well, i will take q 
frame derivative a 
later on, 
if chain ruled n frame derivative 
b, you pick a frame across a product, 
across a scalar part that product, 
youre pretty much committed, right 
this is if you inertial, 
you plug in, 
i think i also showed last time that if 
you in body frame, example, 
gimbal frame, 
thats another one you could pick 
youll always get answer 
you would expect, right 
so this a good exercise taking 
derivatives scalars since scalars 
a function vectorial quantities, 
to put that together 
so definition 
today, you see this 
j is nothing, 
summation inertia frame 
plus wheel within frame 
sums appear everywhere, 
so we define j that 
then, yeah, fun, you in 
homework, theres subresults there 
we this, 
final definition is is, 
is inertia hub itself, 
plus inertia vscmg combined, 
gives us spacecraft inertia 
so this one now, this i 
vary seen body frame 
yes 
yeah, this one is fixed 
a rigid hub, if this is 
a variable speed cmg youre gimbaling, 
that wheel, 
mass distribution change 
if you a reaction wheel, 
j vary seen body, 
if you a reaction wheel 
right, no, that wheel, even 
though youre spinning down, 
perfectly symmetric balanced, 
theres change in mass distribution 
one particle replaces next particle 
so, anyway, so keep that in mind, 
you simulations, 
in this case, youre going to simulate 
this in this class, , you would 
things you would to 
update every time step, is fun 
theres really interesting 
code youre writing there 
you guys think estimation is bad, 
you idea 
this is fun stuff 
so we equations motion, 
this is kind we 
ended last time 
this is a rigid spacecraft plus 
a single vscmg device, 
we still external 
torques that act it, right 
thats motor torques, 
thats gravity gradient torques 
radiation pressure, this good stuff 
before, if a reaction wheel, 
vanishes 
well see that today 
goes to if a reaction 
wheel, instead a vscmg 
endor 
gamma dot terms 
gamma dot, yeah, anything else 
gamma double dot also goes to , 
so this vanishes, this vanishes 
this stuff vanishes, 
in fact, 
you get this term, 
you get this term this term 
if you go back look 
dual spin equations motion, 
let put this 
dual spin stuff, 
you exactly terms 
one difference was, 
we didnt gs gt gg, there, 
dual spinner, 
we lined wheel b 
in essence, b is gs, 
right, that is that axis 
so make that replacement, 
a to thing 
this is a slightly general version, 
wheel doesnt 
to line b axis 
thats we found 
if is a cmg, kevin, 
much simplifies 
you get rid 
omega inaudible 
thats it, whoopdy do, 
still left million terms 
so now, 
especially you lots cmg, 
thats you see mathematics 
cmgs, way complicated right away 
in fact, if you a dual spinner 
constant speed, even this time goes to , 
gets simpler 
this is we ended last time
