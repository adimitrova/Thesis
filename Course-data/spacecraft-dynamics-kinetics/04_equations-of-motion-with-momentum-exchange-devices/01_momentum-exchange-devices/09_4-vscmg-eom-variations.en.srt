1
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:10,389
Now, we're going to look
at how this all simplifies.

2
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:13,924
If we have a single reaction wheel,
we mentioned earlier,

3
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,702
if you just have these all 0.

4
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,775
Gimbal rates at zero,
gimbal acceleration is zero.

5
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:21,833
That means this whole frame is
locked down, relative to the body,

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,815
these earlier equations
simplify to this form.

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,240
And that's nice.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,480
So now, what we can do too
is you could rewrite this.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,050
We're going to use the motor torque
equation to get rid of big omega dot.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,400
So I'm taking that extra differential
equation, I'm going to solve for

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,110
omega dot, back substitute it so

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,150
I get my spacecraft accelerations
in terms of the motor torque.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,910
One thing, I can show you this
in identity, this term here,

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,610
with a little bit of algebra, you can
show that it relates to omega cross gs.

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,950
They just,
if you carry out the cross product terms,

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,830
that's what you come up with.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,900
So that's what I used to
replace this with this part.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,702
The next thing is this is the motor
torque equation without gimbaling, so

19
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,405
there's not gamma tau term in there.

20
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:06,130
And that's good.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,192
And so you can see in here,
there is a Js times big omega dot.

22
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:12,360
Js times big omega dot.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,278
I could then directly substitute this,
I can take Js times this, bring it over

24
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:22,450
to the left hand side and substitute
this back up in here, I can do that.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,180
If you do that, you end up with
a term here that's going to be Js.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,010
This is Js times this,
you're still going to have a Js over here,

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,870
gs, gs transposed omega dot.

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,710
Here we have the full
inertia tensor times this.

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,240
And this inertia was the space
craft inertia plus the gimbal and

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,050
wheel frame inertia.

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,470
So I is all of this plus Js,
Ts, gs transpose, as well.

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,150
But since, when you substitute this
back in there, you get this extra term.

33
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,110
It's just like this last
term you have here.

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,160
Those two actually cancel.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,060
So, for the reaction wheel form that I'm
showing you, people often ignore this and

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,170
include that extra term,
which doesn't make momentum work.

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,579
This will be the full answer.

38
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,539
You can then, so redefining that, I can
rewrite these groups in terms a little

39
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,500
bit, but this is more the classic form
that you would see for reaction wheels.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,310
For reaction wheels we come up with
control loss that I'll show one example of

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,270
then, where we come up with
torque level control loss.

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,150
CMGs as I cover in 6010, we don't come
up with motor torque level control loss.

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,420
We come up with gimbal rates as
Mario is pointing out right?

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,440
We want to take advantage of that
gyroscopic torque as we twist.

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,320
So we command a twist rate and

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,770
then you have a sub server system
that implements that twist rate.

47
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,418
But that's bunch of
lectures in the future.

48
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:49,150
So this is the classic
equation of motion of a wheel,

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,870
of the spacecraft with
a single reaction wheels.

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,090
But oriented in a very general way, gs,
gT, don't have to line up with B one,

51
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,720
two and
three like we did with the dual spinner.

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,290
That's what you'd end up with in there,
so good.

53
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,070
Now that's a single device.

54
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,500
If you do a single CMG, that's really
not much, as you guys mentioned earlier,

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,030
this one term vanishes, but
you're left with everything else.

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,670
This is still the form that we use because
we don't solve for the motor torques,

57
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,440
we don't back substitute here.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,800
In fact, this is the term that gives
us the huge gyroscopic effect.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,370
The big omega times the small gimbal rate,

60
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,840
which is still a very
big torque acting on it.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,888
So, in fact, to control the valves of this
you find they come up with laws to come up

62
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:32,529
with these desired gimbal rates to give
you all the commanded steering and

63
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,920
gyroscopics.

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,820
But this is the full
torque level solution.

65
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,790
Now we've done single VSCMG devices.

66
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,978
Typically you don't fly a single one, we
fly clusters of four at least with VSCMGs,

67
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:47,180
with reaction wheels you may have three,
four.

68
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,950
I've seen some with six and more.

69
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,690
Just depends on, you might use
more than three for redundancy but

70
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,660
also maybe for torque.

71
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,130
Maybe a single wheel that you can get off
the shelf gives you one Newton meter, but

72
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,393
your maneuvers require one and
a half Newton meter.

73
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:05,960
So you may double up on the wheels
just to get more bang there.

74
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,990
So we have to deal with clusters,
systems of them.

75
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,530
And in essence everything
we've done still holds.

76
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,580
It just comes down to book keeping
problem if you have multiple wheels.

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,191
Then where we had one wheel,
that is going to be a gsI, right?

78
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,090
The first gs axis, the second gs axis.

79
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,703
The same thing for the transverse and
the gimbal, everything has 1 through n.

80
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:30,122
And there's some convenient projection
matrices where I'm just making a three by

81
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:34,810
N matrix of the N number of CMG devices,
all the projections calculated.

82
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,410
This inertia, it was before
the HUB plus the single VSCMG,

83
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,670
now list a HUB plus a summation
of all those, all right.

84
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,110
So we just carry out that
kind of a calculation.

85
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,040
And the rest of the gyroscopic terms have
grouped this into these tau vectors.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,720
Those are the gyroscopic terms and within
them they're n by ones you will see.

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,430
Each one of these torques acts
about gs1 through gsN axes.

88
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,870
And then the gT1 through gN axis,
and the gG one to the gGN axis.

89
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,030
So it allows you to write in a little

90
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,040
bit more compact way, this way whereas
before, we had gs times all those terms.

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,869
If you did it like this,

92
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,242
it would take you probably two pages
to write out every single term.

93
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:25,017
So it allows you to cheat a little bit,
and just use some substitutions and

94
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,485
notations to simplify.

95
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,665
So if you can do one wheel,

96
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:32,445
really doing multiple wheels
is just a bookkeeping problem.

97
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,155
All the hard part is done, now I just
want to have a nice bookkeeping method.

98
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,810
What we can look at for
examples too is kinetic energy.

99
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,640
We have the kinetic energy that the hub,
great, and then you got the wheel.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,050
It has a spin rate relative to the body
and the wheel also can gimbal.

101
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,140
So if you just go back and

102
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,730
look at omega W relative to N, it has
both big omega and gamma down in there.

103
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,980
Its inertia, the combined inertia system,
you can write this all out,

104
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,010
that's the kinetic energy.

105
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,930
The beauty and you guys aren't doing it
in this class, 6010 gets to do this fun.

106
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,600
But you take the derivatives of this,
plug in the equations of motion,

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,070
lots of algebra later.

108
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,915
You come up with the same looking
power equation that we've had before.

109
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:14,646
We've solved this power equation and
just for

110
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:19,720
the rotational part you proved that omega
dotted with L was the power that you have.

111
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,160
If an external torque is acting on it.

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,590
So the way you want to
look at this though,

113
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,810
this is kind of called
the Work-Energy principle.

114
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,640
This torque is the torque that acts
on the body relative to inertia.

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,860
You're pushing off with thrusters,
you're really pushing off inertial space,

116
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,470
so to speak with that.

117
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,500
Omega is body relative to inertia.

118
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,570
Big omega here, that's the wheel speed of
the wheel relative to the gimbal frame.

119
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,825
Us is the motor torque acting between
the wheel and the gimbal frame.

120
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:52,348
Little gamma dot is the angular velocity
between the gimbal frame and the body.

121
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:56,030
And ug is the torque acting between
the gimbal frame and the body.

122
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,540
This patterns holds, and

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,860
you'll see this in a lot of
analytic dynamics text materials.

124
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,250
Once you've recognized it and
know how it gets there,

125
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,100
instead of taking this derivative and
getting there it's really powerful.

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,190
Saves you lots of days of algebra.

127
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,820
But anyway, so
we have a nice power expression even for

128
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,670
the really complicated
multi VSCMG equation.

129
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,451
We don't do much with it in this class,
but other classes you might see them.

130
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:24,562
So the next step is now let's we
did the equations of motion for

131
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:25,808
a single reaction wheel.

132
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:28,859
If we apply the same principle,
we have this IRW,

133
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:32,275
instead of we only have to account for
the transverse and

134
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,800
gimbal axis directions of
the wheel inertia in this IRW.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,110
But instead of just one,
we have n of them.

136
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,200
So it's just a summation again, right?

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
We have this h vector.

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,240
We saw this h vector with a dual spinner.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,570
At some point I defined
the momentum of the second,

140
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,380
the dual part,
relative to the body like that.

141
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,860
And that's also appearing here.

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,010
This is kind of a common notation.

143
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,180
And you put this all together, with
a little bit of algebra, it's not much.

144
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,043
You can write now your
equations of motions and

145
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:03,682
nice matrix form where us is the stack,
the n by 1 of all the motor torques.

146
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,300
And then you can get out of this
your angular rate of acceleration.

147
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,009
The nice thing about this form is l don't
have big omega dot showing up anymore.

148
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,925
l mean once l know what
the motor torques are,

149
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,558
l essentially decoupled these
two differential equations.

150
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:17,598
l can get omega dot directly.

151
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,411
And that same motor torque you applied
to the motor torque equations, and

152
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,880
then you know now what big omega dot is.

153
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,590
You substitute it in as a known and

154
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,830
you get your big omega dots,
the wheel acceleration.

155
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,840
So this gives you a way,

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,400
we've kind of analytically one
way solved the sets of equations.

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,670
That's good.
So that's if you have a system of them.

158
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,110
A popular configuration of gs, that's
all the projection axis is you line up.

159
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,200
The first wheel with b1, the second wheel
with b2 and the third wheel with b3.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,786
In that case,
this projection matrix is nothing but

161
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:53,738
100010001 which is an identity matrix,
right?

162
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:58,910
And then the gs just drop out and
you end up with this form.

163
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,497
But this form is nice because if you even
try to do it perfectly with b1 what if

164
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:03,970
you're off by a degree or two?

165
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,540
This form allows you to solve it in a much
more general way without that perfect

166
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,780
alignment assumption.

167
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,882
But that's a differential equation where
we do control we'll use this particular

168
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,348
differential equation, and

169
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,874
come up with a control development
to do stabilizing that you'll see.
