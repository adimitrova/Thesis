okay, so weve done a review 
devices 
there certain benefits, 
everything drawbacks, 
we need to get math 
we get equations 
motion things 
so going to stepping 
this carefully 
we going to 
spacecraft a single vscmg 
so thats a single variablespeed 
controlmoment gyroscope 
thats a single axis 
controlmoment gyroscope 
there a few 
that flown this way 
yes, jordan 
sorry, 
going back really quick to cmgs, 
you know if there that use 
like flux spinning to like, so 
that could levitate bearing 
rotate 
there are, yeah 
because, especially, well, 
variable speed, 
air force a nice program, 
fred levy running that, 
to look energy storage, you 
spin this wheels, you despin them, 
you actually pull you could turn 
mechanical energy in dimo effect 
you turn electrical energy, 
so this could replace a battery 
you to spin to pretty high 
speeds to make efficient 
so theyre looking , 
, rpms, really fast 
mechanically worrying friction 
little imbalances is quite tricky 
so theres that looking 
magnetic bearings, levitation, 
kind things 
necessarily flux pinning, i havent 
heard that one used but, magnetic 
bearings, absolutely, you will find 
devices looking that 
yep, so theres a lot mechanical 
challenges to this well, 
robust, survives launch, you 
get shaken to death, almost hopefully, 
slight 
so anyway, so think vscmg a hybrid, 
well math 
cmg 
reaction wheel embedded in one 
so we talk to this 
i want you to understand this path, 
deal parts specialties it, 
thats going to goal 
so goes time, to wrap this 
so convenient 
we run but, 
this vscmgs devices 
researched 
done actually phoned small sats via 
cmg tested well already 
so this is theoretical, 
this is starting to happen 
this is stuff i way back 
phd, one chapters in phd 
so going to try look this 
one niceties im going to 
highlight is we talked cmgs 
singularities 
well find is vscmg actually avoids 
this move, changing wheel 
speeds, i actually produce torques 
axis to tork direction 
that useful, 
highly redundant, device 
if a variable speed you could use 
a reaction wheel, a cmg 
so thats two control modes that 
devices that gives you 
eight control modes, 
still a three degree problem 
so youve got a lot redundancy 
built in is sometimes nice, 
also combine power energy storage, 
something we discussed 
thats something people 
researching looking 
would nice, 
that we didnt need batteries much 
so we get equations motion 
basically boils to this one 
little, simple equation, right 
hard could that 
kind like, hey youre 
whole dissertation fma, thats 
right, if youre orbits, 
trajectories, unstable manifolds 
youre doing, daniels laughing, 
thats really thats 
youre is fma, right 
hard is that, in attitude 
hequal to l hard that 
ill show you here 
this is hint that 
if you want fun go chat 
cody john lab, 
theyve imbalanced vscmg 
equations that quite interesting 
so lets review this, 
is hequal to l 
is l here 
start in right hand side, andre 
inaudible 
specific 
inaudible 
body 
body 
we multiple 
rigid body 
rigid bodies 
wheels 
no, external torque 
exactly, right 
if this is a dynamical system, 
this applied to blobs in space, 
jello flying space 
net external torque 
acting this dynamical system 
we dont blobs 
we will systems rotating, 
a multirigid body problem 
essentially that solving here 
so thats net external torques 
we dont need motor torques 
whatever that reactional spin 
torque is doesnt appear here, 
thats an internal torque 
gimbal access motor torque 
appear here also an internal torque 
so externals, gravity gradients, 
solar radiation pressure drag, 
maybe you thrusters to augment this 
maybe momentum dumping 
people still use thrusters sometimes, 
that could good 
is h left hand side 
robert 
tip tongue, im 
total angular momentum 
total angular momentum, right 
this dynamic assistance 
so if a blob, entire 
thing, quite a blob here 
us a spacecraft, plus wheels, 
plus frame whatever 
holds things together 
everything that momentum, 
angular momentum, we to account 
whats this baud here, 
type time derivative we taking 
you know we often 
good reason things in a body frame, 
transport theorem is 
going to this 
we to that, right 
also point 
we taken torks in momentum here 
center mass, actually 
so this either to a center 
mass point taking moments 
torques an inertial point 
h equal to l is true 
if youre talking a body fix point, 
thats anything else center mass, 
there extra turnums 
that to appear here 
so inbalance things makes 
things immediately much complicated 
so h equal to l 
we assume this is 
center mass this system 
wheels balanced so 
even im trying gyrating 
im really changing 
im putting gimballing angles in 
im changing center mass 
that cmg configuration, im 
changing axis is pointing 
im changing inertias 
center mass, so 
that makes huge simplifications 
so we need frames to define this 
stuff, ive got this gimbal frame 
so you will gs is spin axis, 
so this is wheel, 
if reaction wheel 
this is you would 
a reaction wheel in a gimbling frame, this 
is we twist that spinning wheel, 
gg is gimble axis, that 
cmg devices solves a pancake 
motor knob sticking left 
right, actually gg axis 
so gs is spin axis, gimble axis, 
gt is transverse axis, 
third axis that 
cannot complete a full frame 
gs crossed to gt gives you plus gg, okay 
so thats are, 
weve defined 
big omega here is going to 
wheel speed 
treating here time varying 
later we freeze to make 
a cmg device, a variable speed cmg 
gimbel angles defined gamma, 
so gimbel rate 
i twisting things is 
gamma dot, thats thats defined 
so thats rotation 
rate this gg axis, 
so kinematics is going to come back in 
so full frame is gs, gt, 
gd, thats g frame that we 
this is one well use a lot 
so lets talk angle velocities, 
angular velocity gimbal 
frame relative to body 
this is we attach this device to 
a body, motor is taking 
twisting left right, right 
so this is twist rate axis 
youre twisting is gg 
so angular velocity g frame 
relative to b frame is going 
to gamma times gg 
classic kinematics we 
in first part class 
theres a wheelframe, 
im going to introduce this quickly, 
within a few steps, 
going to ignore 
well make arguments 
we ignore 
so wheelframe needs three axis 
im picking principal axis, so spin 
axis, ds, i reuse to lazy 
thats first one 
i a wt 
a wg two axis that 
fixed relative to wheel, 
so wheel rotates, axis 
going to rotate wheel, right 
so if you look wheel frame, 
you go ahead 
get angular velocity wheel 
system relative to gimbal frame, 
thats simply going to wheels spin 
rate times wheel spin axis, thats 
so if you sat wheel frame set 
this gimbal frame, look wheel 
you would see wheels spinning 
that axis that rate vice versa 
so we two 
if you need omega w, relative to b, 
you would add two course, 
thats how, so we get 
combinations omegas that we need 
lets talk inertias 
im assuming this thing is built in a way 
that i three principal inertias 
this gimbal contraption 
theyd line gs, gt, gt frame 
recently good assumption, 
may perfect 
a good simplifying in analysis 
that right 
so i igs, igg, gt igg 
so ig is inertias gimbal 
frame along st g axis 
thats subscripts 
coming 
wheel, we write that in 
wheel frame, youre going to 
an inertia here so thats going to 
wheel inertia axis 
i iwt, wheel 
is perfectly symmetric, right 
imbalances, warping, 
kind stuff 
going to 
inertia 
two orthogonal axis in plane 
disc, wheel, right 
so i iwt, iwt 
now, here im saying wheel 
inertia in gimbal frame, 
is actually going to wheel 
inertia expressed in wheel frame 
that happen 
i think this is really, 
thats an inertial tensor 
this is a matrix representation 
inertial tensor, 
i picked w frame 
here im claiming if i 
picked w frame 
g frame, 
give you answer 
you think that is 
theres a degenerate 
eigenvalue in w inertia 
youre getting mathematical 
no, youre right 
there is a repeated eigenvalue in here 
that means that axes actually, 
eigenaxes that generates 
inertias unique 
if we go back look that 
we talked eigenvalue 
an axis symmetric body 
we is 
in torque 
free motion an axis symmetric body, 
that stuff 
so you dont to pick 
i could really, to get this diagonal 
i to pick this axis 
i to pick two axis that 
orthogonal to gs will 
if two axis will do, 
i always pick gt 
gg if you wanted to, 
theyll give you answer 
so actually i wrote 
a quick mathematical thing 
so really im going to evaluate this now, 
im pulling in library 
im going to define here 
this a diagonal matrix 
in this case g frame, ive got this 
now, since gs is first axis, 
im we call 
m basically that one axis 
rotation that we needed an angle 
so, youd , , 
i metrics form wg, right 
so thats classic note, thats 
rotation one axis 
rotation gs is first axis 
so if i translate here 
gimbal frame to wheel frame, 
this is i could do, 
i get this answer you 
identify this cosine 
squared thing sine squared 
things 
going to drop to b, 
this math you get nothing 
exactly result even though 
we this code transformation 
so if you dont believe geometric 
arguments, you quickly math 
validate go, yeah 
actually, this inertia tensor is 
diagonally in w frame 
in g frame, thats we need, 
that saves us a lot transpose 
without end youre 
is creating a lot trigs that 
become one in end needed 
good, so thats kind helps 
explain that one last slide 
i need to get corner frames 
attitudes 
we body attitude, 
we know to describe that already, 
mrps, dcm, 
cortanians whatever you want to wish 
we need to get attitude gimball 
frame relative to body frame 
if you go back 
look we defined dcms, right 
basically mapping n to b 
im going to write that one 
if recall bn ended n, 
n, n in b frame components, 
that one way to write row, 
b, in n frame components 
so if we go back look 
definitions, if you three axis, 
you actually construct 
dcn quickly 
in fact here, im using this one, so 
instead having, i here 
let go back 
here we bg instead bm 
so instead n, , , i g 
first, second third axis i put in 
b frame component 
is we define 
thats give you to dcm 
so that works 
so if we bg 
if i need to get inertia 
tensor diagonal in 
g frame is great 
i typically will need in end 
in body frame, well a lot body 
frame relative derivatives, i would 
to reimposed multiply dcm, right 
to map one frame 
another frame you that 
mathematics here become quite simple, 
ig is a diagonal 
this one i write like this 
so, lets kind 
this hand 
so, if i bg is equal to first 
vector, second, third, 
i need to compute bg times 
i in g frame components times b, 
g transpose, right 
that would give ig body frame 
now, if you write in matrix form 
like this, going to nothing 
gs, gt, gg thats bg times 
this diagonal igs , 
, igt, , 
, igg times matrix transposed 
so, this transpose becomes gs transposed, 
gt transposed gg transposed, right 
you start to carry 
this matrix math here 
if you look second part, 
this is going to igs times gs 
you think this like a vectrix, 
matrix vectors that 
we talked earlier 
so this, youll going to 
get is igs times gs hat transpose igt, 
second row, times this, 
time this, drops out, gt 
transpose plus igg, gg transpose 
so thats that part times this, so, 
laugh gss, lets see 
actually thats right, hold 
this is a single line 
this is a three three 
times a three one 
this is plus, thats wrong 
this would to go here, 
this goes here 
this a three one 
a three three 
times a three one 
that a three one, 
one three times three one 
i to is gs times 
this term, gt times that term, 
gg times this term, 
thats you get final answer 
so here, if i go backwards, igs, gs, 
gs transpose plus terms 
thats 
so a nice analytic way that 
we projections 
inertia one frame to another 
you will see this is a handy result 
to well use several times we go 
that 
so thats done here 
this one also in gimbal frame, 
i thing, 
instead igs, igt, 
i iws, iwt thats 
a little bookkeeping 
so you get exactly result 
so we inertias 
written in two different frames 
good, next step, angular momentum 
you guys said h to angular 
momentum total system 
system will composed 
a single vscmg, so 
a spacecraft, 
thats part b, thats body 
i g that denotes inertia 
momentum gimbal frame that 
mass rotates stuff 
you hw is 
momentum wheel 
spinning that 
so we to add momentums 
one momentums 
is bodies relative to 
inertial frame 
so body this is dead simple, 
youve done this 
im using is now, that is 
inertia tensor spacecraft 
youll see a different 
i appearing later 
so this one right is 
spacecraft 
center mass 
reaction wheel, 
cng devices already accounted in that 
is momentum 
wheeldisk part spinning 
center mass disks 
so a lot is already lumped in there 
this part will easy to go forth 
ones get complicated 
so gimbal frame, 
math first step 
we ig times, 
i need omega g relative to n 
omega g relative to n is omega g relative 
to b plus b relative to n, right 
earlier we kept calling this omega, 
here a little explicit 
weve got lots different 
frames lots different omegas 
so a little bit 
easier to keep track 
so we need 
this one simply gamma dot times gg 
thats put in here 
one is omega bn 
inertia one ive written 
this projections g frame 
components already 
so, ig times omega bn 
gives this answer, 
ig times this one will 
give this answer 
now, again, 
im jumping a few steps directly 
so let look 
this is a tricky one to in 
homework different ways to solve this 
one thing you could say is, 
you know you ig like this, 
omega g relative to b 
is gamma dot times gg 
well gg times gg here 
transposed gives you 
thats good 
gg times gt transposed, 
whats that going to happen 
dot product between gt gg 
zero, theyre orthogonal, right 
so that drops 
thing gg times gs 
theyre also orthogonal, drop 
so thats one way to 
i think next slide i show you 
another way matrix method 
that will give you 
answer hopefully 
physics 
terms, gs transposed 
omega bn will happen a lot 
if you look at, 
if we showing definition, 
let us recall we 
typically write omega 
so omega bn, we typically write 
omega b omega b omega b 
so we a reframe, omega , , 
nothing , 
access components 
omega is really defined 
b dotted omega bn, 
in matrix form this is equivalent 
to b transpose omega bn, right 
now, here we dont b dotted 
omega, we gs dotted omega 
so if you omega bn, 
gs hat, this is really is going to 
give you, if you think this, 
if this is omega vector 
here is gs vector 
giving you gs component 
that omega vector essentially 
going to call that, instead 
omega , , , weve already used , , 
body frame stuff 
so i cant reuse names, 
im going to use omegas, omegat 
omegag gs, gt, 
gg axis that stuff 
so a slight notational thing 
helps us 
so thats you see defined right here 
we omega is gs 
hat transpose omega 
omega is gt transpose omega 
gg is projection g onto omega 
so omega vector, this is without 
subscripts, we imply omega bn 
point gets old to write 
that stuff 
so this is omega bn is equal to 
three vector components 
that along g axis 
so if you use that definition you 
here gs transpose times omega 
that becomes nothing 
this little omega 
so, momentum expression here 
rewritten a little bit compactly 
in this form that will help us 
in label keeping that we 
so, we to angular momentum 
vector g frame relative to 
inertial frame 
we need next is angular 
momentum wheel 
inaudible 

formula 
you need angular velocity 
wheel relative to inertial, 
we know angular velocity 
wheel relative to gimbal 
that big omega times gs 
that spin axis side 
gimbal relative to body, 
that gamma dot times gg, 
thats gimbaling rate 
course, this is classic 
spacecraft body rate that youd 
if you plug that in you 
three terms to evaluate 
i will to show you different ways 
to it, ill different ways here 
this first term ive written out, 
going to this inertia tensor 
we rewrote earlier a result 
principal inertias times 
outer products times omega 
in here quickly you see 
gs hat transposed omega 
thats we defined to omega 
projection gs axis onto 
omega omega component 
thing omega omega g 
so thats one way we 
get that first term 
that gives us this one 
we want to get two 
im showing you a matrix representation, 

people this might 
a easier way to think 

give you stuff 
this term i write in g frame 
components this diagonal matrix 
g relative to b, 
that gamma dot times gg 
so, in g frame component 
gamma dot, right 
you typical matrix 
math will give you iwt that 
along third axis, 
vector representation that 
thats third axis is gg, so 
you always get back answer 
you could thing also 
this one, here omega w relative to g 
big omega times gs, so big omega 
along first axis wheel frame 
this inertia tensor in wheel frame 
you carry matrix math, 
you get something in first axis, 
is gs representation 
so, this ties back to the, you know, 
week one stuff that we 
vector matrix representation 
you able to go back 
forth 
whatevers convenient itll get you 
there, answer 
now, we these, we add 
to term, you combine them, 
this gives us angular 
momentum wheel that we need 
okay, great 
a few things, we take derivatives, 
well want inertial derivatives and, 
course, well use transport theorems 
a lot inertia tensors 
fixed body frame 
also 
axis benefits 
so, gs, gt, 
gg axis you could write analytically if 
you know orientation launch 
i locked gs pointing 
here gt pointing here, 
theres gimble angle, right 
launch, you rotated degrees, 
you actually compute 
classic cosines sines 
current 
orientations axes 
gg stays always same, hopefully, 
that means you bolted correctly, 
right 
gimbal axis is supposed 
to stay body fixed, always 
a vscmg, gsgt, we 
to treat generally time varying 
so, you write this 
in code in fact, would simulate this 
if i know gimbal angle i 
cant compute instant 
if i know initial orientations 
launch current orientations 
this frame wheel 
far twisted 
right, so 
we will need derivatives this stuff 
if we take body frame derivatives, 
different ways you 
if you want to, you could use this 
expression here take derivatives 
actually 
fixed seen body 
cosine becomes minus sine, 
is right here 
sine becomes cosine, 
you see derivative this is 
going to gt direction 
vice versa 
derivative this one is 
common sense, is going to zero 
thats one way 
you also use a transport 
theorem say, well wait a minute, 
instead taking b frame, if i 
took g frame derivative this stuff 
if you g frame 
derivative gs that is zero, 
i see frame 
axes dont move 
plus you would need omega g 
relative to b, is gamma delta gg, 
crossed this axis, you get a g, 
a third axis cross gs, 
first axis gives 
you plus second one 
you see transport theorem, 
you get answer 
different ways you approach 
i like transport, compact, 
you get there very, 
quickly without writing 
so, we get body frame derivatives, 
key is third one, 
thats locked 
that one doesnt vary, two 
a function gimbal rate 
if you need inertial derivatives, 
we here, 
weve chosen to bframe derivatives 
weve already got 
answers a subresult, 
plus omega crossed axes 
you that, 
carry out, if you write omega 
easy trick here is to get this 
answer in homework i would say 
write omega node omega b, 
omega b youre crossing gs 
instead write omega omega gs, 
omega gt, right 
use g frame components omega 
definitions 
thats terms come in 
then, a classic 
cross products between vectors in 
frame 
so, crossed gives you , crossed 
give you minus , usual rules 
thats you 
get there well 
so, that would work 
so then, 
you derive this 
im kind showing you 
highlights we go 
since we omega s, omega 
omega g, vector components 
body rate in g frame components 
we will also derivatives this 
omega s, omega t, omega g scalars 
so, type derivative 
i taking left hand side 
tebow 
time derivative 
seen frame 
doesnt matter 
doesnt matter, right 
a scalar, so 
that stuff comes back 
if a scalar 
a time derivative 
here, tebow, type 
derivative i chosen to use here 
an inertila derivative 
inertial derivative 
that purely a choice, i didnt 
to use an inertial derivative 
i could used any, 
long im consistent, 
you cant use derivative chain rules 
one part in a one part in b 
if youve taken a, make everything a, 
if youve taken b, make everything b 
math will work 
so, you that, so 
that term is okay, 
angular acceleration dotted 
in gs direction, great 
this term here, gs hat transposed omega 
if you go back look gs hat is here, 
so we this math times, 
we do, 
times omega, gs hat transposed omega 
so, if you see here, gs hat, 
this stuff, transposed omega, 
gt transposed omega, 
that give 
omega 
omega t, exactly 
that projection 
gg transposed omega gives you omega g 
youre going to an omega g, omega 
that product here omega t, 
omega g product 
plus, minus, cancel 
youre left is here times gt times 
that term, that second term, gt 
transposed omega gives you omega 
lets say we body frame 
is that going to look different 
let that hand 
so, so i prove, so if we use this 
formula, i dont need to fire here, okay 
if we use this formula tebow says, 
thats a time derivative 
now, lets say, 
im going to use body frames 
im going to use primes a body frame 
instead writing ddt bs 
that stuff 
you would gs transposed prime, 
right, times omega plus 
gs hat omega bn prime 
well, one thing, omega bn prime, 
that relate to initial derivative 
thing, right 
omega, b n frame is 
so, thats kind cool 
we get right away gs hat transposed 
omega bn dot, inertial derivative 
so, thats good 
this one, we need body 
frame derivative gs, 
if you go back, we that actually 
i showed you results 
here we go 
body framed derivative that, 
different ways you derive it, 
ill use transport theorem, 
nothing gamma dot gt 
if i plug that one in, 
gamma dot gt transposed omega bn, 
this whole thing is nothing 
definition that 
you get answer 
so, expected, hopefully, we took here, 
b frame derivatives, in slides im 
taking n frame derivatives, 
i get answer ways 
so, thats always a good thing to practice 
you know youre 
math correctly 
so, you this you apply this 
three axes 
we inertial derivative 
that you will need a sub result 
we start to take h dot 
start grinding 
so, we that 
one thing well use is 
you will see a lot in math, 
we ig plus iws appearing 
thats inertia 
wheel plus inertia 
gimbal frame that 
holds wheel twists 
so, we sum 
if you see js, nothing, 
basically inertia combined 
wheel gimbal frame system 
so, a notational thing, 
theres lots stuff happening 
fun, you need to this 
yourself, im showing you highlights 
laugh this is you 
apply excellent skills 
transport theorem differentiation, 
we need h dot l, so 
i would say since weve broken 
h hub b h gimbal 
h wheel, separately 
helps manage algebra 
otherwise youre bound to get 
one letter crossed another 
one time 
so if i take h dot using 
transport theorem 
i take derivative 
seen gimbal frame, 
im using a lot 
gimbal frame components 
i need to add plus 
omega gimbal frame, 
relative to inertial, right 
dot is still inertial 
derivative, cross that h expression, 
carry that algebra 
this is you get, 
ill let you that 
you guys good this 
you thing 
gimbal stuff this is you get, 
gimbal frame stuff 
body itself, well thats 
pretty trivial, weve done this 
a single rigid body, you regain 
derivative expression, right 
we pack together h dot 
l is a sum three 
going to use this definition, 
j inertia gimbal frame 
wheel, combined vscmg device 
this is inertia rigid 
part spacecraft 
so this one is actually constant, 
seen body frame 
this one isnt, inertia, 
everything is spinning twisting 
i is combined spacecraft 
inertia, thats full thing 
rigid part plus spinning, 
twisting wheel parts, combined 
that means i in this notation 
actually becomes time varying 
if you simulate things, 
every time step, 
you to recompute 
axes, inertias 
sum inertia 
contributions 
so becomes even seen body, i 
is time varying is is rigid part 
thats you took advantage you 
earlier differentiation hb, 
that fixed 
seen body frame 
yes, louis 
you guys account 
center mass gimbal system, 
in body 
so things 
taken in account 
is here actually already accounts 
parallel axis part 
that if cg wheels arent 
mounted in center spacecraft, 
center mass spacecraft, 
theyre offset somehow 
that is a fixed offset, 
thats already accounted 
actually here we derive this stuff 
so here wheel 
parts that thats momentum 
inertia is spinning 
perspective center masses 
so center mass is subtlety 
im glossing somewhat, 
this is rigorous, this works, 
you to account 
depending you place them, okay 
theres this much mass there, 
that m distance squared term 
is already put this part 
that part is fixed, 
relative, a balanced wheel 
if inbalanced, question would 
good, an imbalance, 
im rotating, center mass 
wheel is actually orbiting inside 
craft this wouldnt work 
youd to much careful 
points you so 
balanced allows us to, 
complicated is, im sure 
youll agree in homework, 
balanced makes this much, much easier 
so thats a key assumption, so 
we throw this together 
h dot l, i combine terms, 
you will well, 
you come 
kind a terms 
this is i inertial 
tensor hub, 
rigid plus spinning stuff 
you write this form, 
is equation motion 
spacecraft a single 
variable speed cmg 
l is still net external torque 
we talking earlier, so 
that could gravity gradient torque 
acting this deviation pressure, 
if we thrusters acting 
generating pure torques 

system center mass 
inside you terms 
so first thing i always is lets 
make sure equations make sense if we 
simplify 
if we bolt like launch, we 
gimbling, we wheel acceleration, 
everything is locked launch, i 
get back equations motion 
a single rigid body, 
this part this part l 
everything else vanish 
so if you look that you see, okay, 
if i gamma dot, if im locked down, 
theres gimbling going 
so gamma dot to 
this vanishes, this vanishes, lets see, 
gimbal acceleration vanishes 
thats this is , so 
gimbling makes a lot vanish 
if you take remaining 
equations youve got one here, 
iws omega dot, youve got this 
is vanished, that vanished 
you got this term thats nonzero, 
this term thats nonzero 
go back look dual 
spinner equations motion 
there we lined real 
axis along b something 
so if you make gsb, 
you get exactly equations again, 
so thats a nice validation 
if wheel is locked down, 
big omega is 
that means this term vanishes well, 
this term vanishes well, 
theres wheel acceleration 
so, expected, 
terms vanish you 
lock down, is always good 
now, so this is good devices, 
you see gimbling 
adds a lot terms 
theres gamma, gamma, gamma, 
stuff that happens here 
if you a reaction wheel mode, 
we talked that 
we basically get a double spin 
equations motion, way simpler 
if we make a classic cmg 
in that case, wheels speed 
to constant, variable speed 
lets see much simplifies 
one term, woopdedoo 
you got this stuff, so 
cmgs really arent that much 
easier variable speed cmgs, 
you accounted 
stuff spinning gyrating 
is that 
havent flown vscmgs 
have, in fact every 
cmg is in fact a variable speed 
cmg launches spun 
to slowly spin 
is a simple control 
that they, complexity stuff 
here, let show you generates 
control that you 
we body rates pretty small 
i mean, talking small 
people freak this craft goes 
two degrees per second, 
thats nothing 
wheels will going way, way faster 
so cmgs, looking , rpm 
so big omega is going to 
big honking elephant 
so this is small, gimbal rates small, 
this stuff is small 
whats going to give us big torque 
going to this term, right here, 
thats wheel speed, is huge 
iws, is biggest inertia this 
disk we move mass 
gs axis, that give us that ring, 
pancake shape 
gamma dot is directly 
proportional to that 
so, if you hold fixed wing speed, this 
is control torque that we would use 
in a control application, 
thats theyre 
you could make everything else variable, 
thats really in a later 
research, weve finding in 
we avoid singularities 
trick is, reaction wheel, 
generates torque is this one 
ill show you motor torque 
equation in next class 
you accelerate a wheel you get, 
a minus sign, 
an opposite torque back onto craft 
you get one newton meter in, 
you get one newton meter 
here though, if i gimble, a little 
effort, faster wheel is going, 
bigger torque i get 
thats theyve focusing 
so, devices could this 
issue is motor torque 
spin axis typically that strong 
if you to muscle a 
singularity acting like a reaction wheel, 
youre simply going to saturate that 
little motor very, quickly 
so way theyre designing it, 
theyre minimal effort required, 
means tracks within a simple 
bound, tight bound, 
doesnt much 
may take, needs you to spin 
keep roughly speed, 
thats need 
so would a hardware change 
so flown like this 
actually demonstrated that you it, 
a little bit complexity 
in control people, air force in 
particular looking 
form energy storage devices 
to account 
theres extra complexity, 
feel like i 
cmg manufacturer 
chatting phd too, 
theyre saying well, we could also take 
a reaction wheel shelf a cmg 
shelf, combine devices 
to get mathematical benefits 
shelf is always 
cheaper trying to custom 
design specifically something 
so until become common, 
theres different ways you 
here, this is kind of, 
we going to go 
so we see, final comments 
this is, equations motion, 
you see there that wheel speed 
grows, we get a large torque 
also theres limits in reaction 
wheel, fast you spin 
thats that big omega dot 
gimbling is a nice mode, 
you will also singularities 
actually, i think i could 
show well 
this will something gt axis, 
thats one axis 
if i four devices, 
im going to four gt axes 
depending youve lined up, 
you 
axes become coplanar 
if control is outside that, 
will happen commonly external 
disturbances, thats 
a gimbal lock situation 
axis i get 
nice generous torques vary time, 
makes a lot 
things complicated 
that singularity that 
we so, anyway so you see, 
cmgs, definitely a lot benefits, 
amplification 
also mechanical challenges, 
expensive 
you get a lot bang buck, 
way bigger torques you 
get a reaction wheel, 
comes a cost 
controls get challenging,
