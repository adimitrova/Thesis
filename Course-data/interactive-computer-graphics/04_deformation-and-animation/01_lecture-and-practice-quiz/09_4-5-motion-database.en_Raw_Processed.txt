okay 
so next task, next topic is motion 
database 
so work we introduce here is a 
retrieval 
visualization human motion data via 
stick figures 
motivation here is there is a 
large capture database, motion capture 
database available 
so you loads human motion 
captured, lots 
so combining you 
create interesting animation easily 
however, problem is that very, 
difficult to find desired motion 
two problems, difficult to see 
whats 
in database already, so browsing 
difficult 
another problem is that 
difficult to search 
you may want to search specific 
motion, specifying desired emotion is 
easy 
so thats a problem 
approach is to use comic visualization 
stick figure representation 
stick figures comic visualization 
search, enabling us to use 
image motion capture data in this kind 
comic strip like representation 
so in this way you get emotion 
watching 
a static representation you get 
idea motion 
another is a sketch based search 
so you quickly sketch a desired emotion 
system automatically delivers 

whats interesting here is that 
user draws a pose 
user also specify motion, 
trajectory, 
give a joint to find target motion, 
efficiently 
so, let show you a video 
so 
here is a representation, taken this d 
motion input 
system creates this motion 
representation 
looking this comic you 
understand concept motion 
this is stick figure sketch based 
search 
left you draw a query 
system continuously shows 
search result given this new input 
so fast we show generation stick 
figure comic strip motion 
so this is input, animation 
we analyze speed, we 
get key poses, this way 
we select effective 
viewing angle, render 
results 
that is 
you get a inventive presentation 
here is a couple examples 
here is in relation to pose itself, 
system also shows dynamic, 
projectory 
to provide information 
blankaudio 
so this is an example database 
browsing 
so usually in order to browse this kind 
data base, you 
to watch you draw motion 
one one 
here you quickly see whats going 
looking go view 
so next part search 
so, left side you draw, sketch 
desired shape stick figure 
so head, leg, body, you 
see system continuously provides 
feedback a matching result 
blankaudio 
interesting here is that in addition 
to pose 
you control this kind project 
speed, speed line 
so this specifies movement direction 
so here in this way you move the, 
identify shape that waves hand 
this way 
so this filter motion top to 

here is opposite motion 
so we found that this kind speed 
runs is useful this 
unintelligible specific motion 
blankaudio 
user retrieve longer sequence 
sketching 
multiple sequences like fast kick, next 
punch 
something next, you got 

system searches a motion clip that 
satisfies this request 
okay, so let briefly describe 
algorithm 
so first is visualization, next is 
search 
so visualizations, one question to 
answer is what, pose to use 
you know, you long sequence, so many 
poses, 
to pick couple important 
key poses 
so here in this system, weve used a scene 

character changes motion, movement 
direction motion is stopped 
here, you uses, here direction 
suddenly 
changes, so we pick unknown 
pose 
picking unknown poses next 
question is viewing angle to use 
there many ways to lend specifically 
shape 
in d, so you dont to identify a 
effective view, we 
use a perpendicular, a new direction 
is perpendicular to movement 
direction 
so here an example, the, this 
character 
is making a kicking motion, we believe 
that this 
motion, side view, is better front 
view 
you see motion leg 
so we compute trajectory joint, 
moving joint, 
we get a direction 
perpendicular to prominent motion 
search 
so search, one key observation we got 
is, 
joint, specific xy coordinator, joint 
locations accurate 
in users former sketch, you know, 
joint 
unknown changes so much, is so 
unstable 
so we cannot rely joint location, so 
basic positions 
however, we unknown orientation joint 
angle, is relatively stable 
unknown in former user sketch 
so we, we decided to use a d direction, 
orientation 
joint, bone, a key 
search 
another important thing is that there 
multiple matching 
possibilities, so we consider 
possibilities in search 
example, you now, if you a sketch, 
this kind character 
user draws one arm one leg 
so there so many possibilities 
this represent left leg right leg 
this represent left arm right 
arm 
so we consider possibilities 

we turn watch result 
priorities 
okay 
so here is a summary 
so we presented a efficient access to 
large motion capsule database 
so we presented comic base visualization, 
sketch base search 
we discussed iden, identification 
keyboards is directions 
we, measurements that we 
use bone direction search 
so to learn more, original paper is called 
retrieval 
visualization human motion data by, 
via stick figures 
comicstrip presentation, we get 
idea a 
comic chat system, takes a chat 
communication sequence 
inaudible generates comic strips 
representing chat conversation 
also theres a paper d shape 
retrieval, using sketching input, 
this is 
called search engine d models 
this 
interesting little paper to look 

finally, posing 
character posing stick figure 
already explored in 
a paper called sketching interface 
articulated figure animation 
so take d stick figure illustration 

generate smooth d animation 
multiple, stick figures 
use motion capture 
okay, so this is a summary fo this week 
so in this week we discussed formation 
animation 
so instead taking care a rigid d 
shape 
we we discussed to control articulated 
character also form shapes 
we discussed clothing manipulation, 
to put clothing that character 
layer operations, to store 
layers in stacked clothing ropes 
we discussed special key frames to 
make smooth animation articulated 
characters 
procedure deformation means to 
generate 
animation jelly fishes wild 
find way we discussed 
to efficiently access motion 
calculator database 
so, thank you
