next topic we discuss is, spatial key 
framing character animation 
and, work we introduce here 
published spatial key framing 
performancedriven animation 
so motivation here is, creation 
character animation is tedious 
difficult 
so heres a list of, popular techniques, 
so key framing, motion capture, physics 
scripting 
keyframe is way popular 
technique 
so you set key bodies time frame 
so, a program we want to address here 
is creation character animation is 
tedious difficult 
here a list current popular 
techniques 
key framing, motion capture, physics, 
scripting 
so ways popular technique is 
key framing 
so you get a character time 
you place a pose 
like time zero, this pose, time one, this 
pose, time two, this pose 
so individual key framing 
however, this is difficult to 
especially, we use to get a smooth 
animation using this key framing 
if you poorly, like a robotic 
motion 
another popular technique is 
motion capture 
you directly record body motion using 
tracking systems 
however this one requires special device, 
special space, 
also scale, skilled actors is 
difficult 
physics simulation is also used 
good designing character 
animation 
scripting is also used a robotic 
motion, like change angle this to change 
this angle 
however, this is good expressive 
character animation 
so we want to is easily sketch 
create, you know dynamic form motions 
character 
so basic idea is simple 
we believe that best, easiest way is 
to 
directly manipulate a character in front 
camera 
press record, 
manipulate, 
stop play back thing 
so direct recording performers 
best way to 
one problem here is that typical input 
device is limited degree freedom 
so example, if you use a mouse, you 
x y inputs, two dimensional 
inputs 
however, character usually a high 
degree freedom 
so joint three degrees 
rotation freedom, you many many 
joints 
so you to control many joints 
single 
mouse, difficult a 
performancebased recording 
so proposal is to use spatial 
keyframing, so user designer first 
specifies 
prepares key poses in d space 
blend them, depending control 
handle 
so let show you a demo 
so, here is a character in d space 
we make an animation this 
character 
i said, difficult project is key 
framing 
you know, this time, this pose, next time, 
this pose, next time, this pose so 
very, tedious to this 
a long animation sequence 
so, process is to directly record a 
motion 
particularly, if but, if you use one 
one, tedious 
in this you head, arm, 
leg, you cannot manipulate 
together 
so approach is to use a predefined key 
frame 
so you say, this pose is associated 
this 
position, next pause is 
associated this position 
then, so you two key frames 
so, standard key frames associate 
timeline 
here, key frames associated 
spatial locations 
clicking you jump to key 
frames dragging you plan 

so now, you control three joints 
a single mass 
an interesting point here, is that you 
add more, key poses easily 
so, you know three key poses 
blend together, you get 
a reasonably interesting motion already 
you add more, operation 

key poses, like a kick kick so 
right, let show you a couple 
examples 
so, so 
here, again, individual poses so 
complicated 
however, if you hide, start 
moving around ball, you 
make this teddy bear juggling, 
using a twodimensional mouse 
another example is this one 
so again, individual coordinates 
so expressive 
however, you start moving around, 
you make dance like this way 
so here you know, hand motion is 
directly 
appears in character motion, so that 
resulting motion is expressive 
so course, you let go this 
motion you know, one, two, one, two, mm 
so you get this animation 
you get a motion 
so 
you see many different 
locations 
okay 
let show you a couple 
examples 
so here is a kicking motion 
so you many, many couple key 
poses 
dragging this lead ball you 
make 
teddy bear make a high kick, well a 
low kick 
this is a mushroom, jumping, so you 
five six key bodies 
directly manipulating that 
ball you make this animation 
blankaudio 
this is a teddy bear in trouble, i 
think six key poses 
then, you know, says first, 
get idea, happy 
so, you make this kind expressive 
emotion 
using hand motion integrated 
final 
blankaudio 
here this eyeballs also a separate 
joint so you control rotation 
blankaudio 
okay, so let briefly describe 
algorithm to this 
so input to this system is handle 
coordinates 
so, you d mouse, you 
control lead ball position using a 
mouse 
output is orientation 
joint 
so, you many in rotation angles 
so, question here is to represent 
orientation angle, rotation joint angle 
there a couple ways to represent 
joint angles like euler 
angles quaternions here we use a 
rotation matrix, so nine elements 
like this way, so joint a three 
three 
matrix represents also 
axis joint 
we need to control 
nine 
parameters joint depending 
user input 
so lets take this joint 
so, this joint suppose we three 
special key frames, 
key frame this nine 
parameters joint 
user specifies new handle 
position we 
need to compute three three matrix 
this position this joint 
to this we basically blend nearby 
three key poses 
so you wont to this 
lets take, we compute interpretation 
individual elements 
individual entry three 
three matrix 
so this is a simple skeletal body 
interpolation 
here we use a technique called radial 
basis function interpolation 
so this is a scattered data interpolation 
using radial basis functions 
this is a kind stand technique 
you use a possible 
interpolation techniques 
this is easy to implement, easy 
to use 
idea is simple 
so a supposed example you three 
skeletal bodies special location 
location, we a 
kernel function 
kernel function, we eh, compute 
appropriate waiting coefficients 
kernels 
adding together, 
you will get a smooth, interpolating 
function 
if you want to know more, you can, i 
recommend you to take paper turk in 
so 
computing this line, this 
skeletal body interpolation individual 
elements, you nine elements in a 
three three matrix 
unfortunately, if you apply 
interpolation independently to 
entries in resulting matrix, is 
necessarily orthonormal, you know 
rotation matrix needs to be, orthonormal 
also perpendicular to 
also directions equal to 
one 
so that we apply orthonomalization 
operation to 
three three matrix to get this 
one 
i always skip details this 
orthonormalization theres a standard 
approach 
okay, so heres a summary 
so we introduce spatial keyframing 
creating character animation quickly 
easily 
a user defines key poses in screen 
space, system automatically 
blends nearby key poses 
in order to so, we use rotation matrix 

we use radial basis function interpolation 
element in matrix 
so to learn more, original paper 
published spatial keyframing 
performancedriven 
animation, if you want to learn 
interpolation radial basis 
functions 
theres a paper titled modeling 
implicit surfaces that interpolate 
heres an example 
so use a space prior positions in d 
space 
this technique generates a 
beautiful smooth surface 
interpolating points 
interpolation d angles is popular 
topic discussion in graphics community 
popular technique used is 
quaternion interpretation 
i recommend you take a lot 
original paper published in siggraph 
thank you
