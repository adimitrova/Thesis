1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,350
Okay.

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,250
So next task, next topic is motion
database.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,120
So the work we introduce here is a
retrieval

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,410
on visualization of human motion data via
stick figures.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,010
The motivation here is there is a

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,620
large capture database, motion capture
database available.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,910
So you have loads of human motion
captured, lot's of them.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,440
So by combining them you can.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,790
Create interesting animation very easily.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,770
However, the problem is that it's very,
very difficult to find desired motion.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,640
Two problems, it's very difficult to see
what's

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,950
in the database already, so browsing can
be difficult.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,840
Another problem is that it's very
difficult to search.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
You may want to search for specific

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,770
motion, but specifying desired emotion is
not easy.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,320
So thatâ€™s a problem.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,770
Our approach is to use comic visualization
of stick figure representation.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,210
Stick figures for comic visualization and
search, enabling us to use the

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,850
image or motion capture data in this kind
of comic strip like representation.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,280
So in this way you can get emotion just by
watching

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,210
a static representation and then you get
the idea of the motion.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,460
And then another is a sketch based search.

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,480
So you quickly sketch a desired emotion

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,300
and then the system automatically delivers
it.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,480
And what's interesting here is that not
only user draws a pose.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,140
But user can also specify the motion,
trajectory, or

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,590
give a joint to find the target motion,
efficiently.

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,480
So, let me show you a video.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,980
So

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,210
here is a representation, taken this 3D
motion as input.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,130
The system creates this motion as
representation.

32
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,640
By looking at this comic you can
understand the concept of motion.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,910
And this is stick figure sketch based
search.

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,060
On the left you draw a query

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,160
and the system continuously shows the
search result given this new input.

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,000
So fast we show the generation of stick
figure comic strip from motion.

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,700
So this is input, animation.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,370
And then we analyze the speed, and then we
get the key poses, this way.

39
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,150
And then we select the most effective

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,649
viewing angle, and then render the
results.

41
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,110
And that is all.

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,110
You get a very inventive presentation.

43
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,750
Here is a couple of examples.

44
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,040
Here it is in relation to the pose itself,

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,140
the system also shows the most dynamic,
most projectory.

46
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,230
To provide more of the information.

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:24,230
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:37,019
So this is an example of database
browsing.

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,300
So usually in order to browse this kind of
data base, you

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,620
have to watch and then you draw the motion
one by one.

51
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:53,220
But here you can quickly see what's going
on by looking at the go about view.

52
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
So our next part of the search.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,210
So, on the left side you draw, sketch the
desired shape of the stick figure.

54
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,300
So head, and leg, and body, and as you

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,628
see the system continuously provides
feedback of a matching result.

56
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:22,628
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:39,925
Now interesting here is that in addition
to the pose itself

58
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:43,690
you then can control this kind of project
speed, speed line.

59
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,680
So this specifies our movement direction.

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,720
So here in this way you can move the,

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,410
identify the shape that waves the hand
this way.

62
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,780
So this can filter out motion from top to
down.

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,980
And here is the opposite motion.

64
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,502
So we have found that this kind of speed

65
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:14,789
runs is very useful for this
[unintelligible] specific motion.

66
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:24,789
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,377
User can retrieve longer sequence by
sketching

68
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:38,750
multiple sequences like fast kick, next
punch.

69
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,440
And then do something next, then you got
the

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,340
system searches for a motion clip that
satisfies this request.

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,580
Okay, so let me briefly describe the
algorithm.

72
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,060
So first is visualization, and next is
search.

73
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,320
So visualizations, the one question to
answer is what, which pose to use?

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,150
You know, you have long sequence, so many
poses,

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,650
and they have to pick couple of important
key poses.

76
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,750
So here in this system, we've used a scene
where the

77
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,860
character changes it's motion, movement
direction or when the motion is stopped.

78
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,432
But here, you uses, here the direction
suddenly

79
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,590
changes, so we pick it as the [UNKNOWN]
pose.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,580
And after picking the [UNKNOWN] poses next
question is which viewing angle to use.

81
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,310
There are many ways to lend specifically
the shape.

82
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,060
In 2D, so you don't have to identify a
most effective view, we

83
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,630
use a perpendicular, it's a new direction

84
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,540
which is perpendicular to the movement
direction.

85
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,160
So here an example, when the, this
character

86
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,870
is making a kicking motion, we believe
that this

87
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,010
motion, side view, is better than front
view

88
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,990
because you can see the motion of the leg.

89
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,310
So we compute the trajectory of the joint,
most moving joint,

90
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,740
and then we get a direction most
perpendicular to the prominent motion.

91
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,620
And search.

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,990
So for search, one key observation we got
is,

93
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,940
joint, specific XY coordinator, joint
locations are not very accurate.

94
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,239
Because in user's former sketch, you know,
joint

95
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:26,180
[UNKNOWN] changes so much, and is so
unstable.

96
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,560
So we cannot rely on joint location, so
basic positions.

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,535
However, we [UNKNOWN] orientation of joint
angle, is relatively stable.

98
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,920
[UNKNOWN] in former user sketch.

99
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,850
So we, we decided to use a 2D direction,
orientation of

100
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,280
each joint, or each bone, as a key for the
search.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,000
Another important thing is that there are
multiple matching

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,590
possibilities, so we consider all
possibilities in the search.

103
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,580
For example, you now, if you a sketch,
this kind of character.

104
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,190
The user draws only one arm and one leg.

105
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,450
So there are so many possibilities.

106
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,650
This can represent left leg or right leg.

107
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,520
And this can represent left arm or right
arm.

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,630
So we just consider all the possibilities
and then

109
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,240
we turn over and watch the result of these
priorities.

110
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,390
Okay.

111
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,460
So here is a summary.

112
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,590
So we presented a efficient access to
large motion capsule database.

113
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,450
So we presented comic base visualization,
and sketch base search.

114
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,490
And we discussed iden, identification
keyboard's is and during directions.

115
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,470
And those are we, the measurements that we
use bone direction for the search.

116
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,750
So to learn more, original paper is called
Retrieval

117
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,378
and Visualization of Human Motion Data by,
via stick figures.

118
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:54,370
And the comic-strip presentation, we get
idea from a

119
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,298
Comic Chat system, which takes a chat
communication sequence.

120
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:04,600
And the [INAUDIBLE] generates comic strips
representing the chat conversation.

121
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,000
And also there's a paper on 3D shape

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,270
retrieval, using sketching as input, and
this is

123
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,230
called search engine for 3D models and
this

124
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,330
can be interesting little paper to look
at.

125
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,590
And finally, posing.

126
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,370
Character posing by stick figure was
already explored in

127
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,140
a paper called sketching interface for
articulated figure animation.

128
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,550
So they take 2D stick figure illustration
and then

129
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,110
generate smooth 3D animation by doing
multiple, stick figures.

130
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,850
But they did not use motion capture.

131
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,670
Okay, so this is a summary fo this week.

132
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,140
So in this week we discussed the formation
and animation.

133
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,638
So instead of taking care of a rigid 3D
shape.

134
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:55,269
We we discussed how to control articulated
character and also the form of our shapes.

135
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,720
And we discussed clothing manipulation,
how to put clothing on that character.

136
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,050
And the layer operations, how to store up
layers in stacked clothing or ropes.

137
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,050
And we discussed special key frames to

138
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,000
make smooth animation of our articulated
characters.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
And procedure deformation means to
generate

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,900
animation of jelly fishes and wild.

141
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,410
And then find the way we discussed

142
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,110
how to efficiently access motion
calculator database.

143
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,790
So, thank you.
