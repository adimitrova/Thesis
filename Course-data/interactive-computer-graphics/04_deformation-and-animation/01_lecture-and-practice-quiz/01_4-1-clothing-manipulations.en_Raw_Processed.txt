hello 
this is week interactive computer 
graphics course 
topic this week is deformation 
animation 
so, last week we discussed moving 
d shapes 
kind rigid shapes, there is 
deformation there is motion 
in this we discuss to make move, 
to make form 
one way to change pose articulated 
character, frog 
possibility is, is to deform 
objects 
consistent deformed object like frogs 
robes jellyfish unknown 
this you see this is much 
difficult there 
lots information there time 
sequence articles positions 
we will discuss inaudible 
toughest to control so many information 
so topics we discussed here 
first one is clothing manipulations, 
so putting garment character 
next one is layer operations 
controlling stacked clothes robes, 
so 
then, we will describe spatial key 
framing technique to animate character 
also, procedural deformation 
technique 
animating jellyfish unknown 
so 
then, finally we will describe a 
method to handle large motion capture 
data 
first one is clothing manipulation 
so this is work titled clothing 
manipulation published in 
problem we want to address here is 
that clothing manipulation is difficult 
many people working clothes 
simulation, i thought that 
so many people working manipulation 
control clothing 
so this is, a popular techniques 
in field 
one poss, popular approach is to put 
rigid clothes pieces along 
body start simulation 
clothes will snap to body 
this is popular clothes 
however, users point view 
tedious to place piece 
clothing around body d 
rotation d position control 
popular demonstration is 
this 
kind realtime simulation clothes 
material 
user interest point view, 
like manipulating a handkerchief 
using a chopstick 
good putting clothing 
that character 
so we want to here, is a way to 
make 
easy to put clothes a character in a 
flex way, flexible way 
you know, there so many different ways 
to put clothing a character 
we want to develop technique to make 
easy to test many variations 
okay let show you, a video 
so we introduce two techniques here, 
wrapping 
dragging, first one is 
wrapping 
blankaudio 
so here you a d character here, 
we try to put clothing this d 
character 
right hand you a garment 
editor 
then, you design a garment here a 
d pattern 
so you will, you design a d shape, 
put this garment onto this character 
i said, keep options to push 
pull, individual 
body, allowing this d body, 
timing consuming difficult 
so approach is to use painting 
interface 
so user unknown specify part 
go 
so this line, three lines go 
here, here, here 
this thing, system tries 
to put 
clothing character so that 
painted marks matches together 
so press wrap button 
blankaudio 
you will instantly get final 
shape 
i think much faster efficient 
standard dragging operations 
blankaudio 
so heres another example 
here we tried to make unknown 

we tried to put this garment this 
character 
so you draw lines here 
there is also a line here, 
corresponding lines this character 
press wrap, you suddenly 
get unknown this character 
here is a little bit complicated 
example 
so you would paint four strokes 
also corresponding strokes 
character 
so in this way you get a specific way 
putting garment character 
blankaudio 
heres a little bit complicated 
example 
so you quickly design this kind 
tshirt 
a shirt you put in this 
garment 
again, if you use traditional dragons 
inaudible operations 
tedious to control this 
blankaudio 
so this unknown 
so instead moving around garment, 

system actually grows a garment this 
character 
so next operation, is surface dragging 
so putting a garment a character 
you may want to relocate adjust 
position 
this is technique 
blankaudio 
so here basically idea, so typical 
dragging real 
time clothes simulation is move 
single objects 
rely physics to move around 
vertices 
however, this is convenient making 
a drastic, 
a large deform, large motion around 
body surface 
blankaudio 
so this here is an example traditional 
single vertex dragging 
so make a local shape change, 
hard to make a global 
change 
so people propose is called surface 
dragging 
so you drag a single vertex, 
system dies, propogates motion 
allowing unknown 
allows a small motion, bodies 
going to move 
together, so you make a big change 
a single drag 
blankaudio 
so heres an example 
so you easily even 
you rotate skirt around body 
surface 
this kind dynamic fast motion is 
possible standard single vertex 
simulation method 
so you move this cloth along body 
surface 
blankaudio 
system also takes care 
basic physics, 
so there is penetration, also 
gravity effect 
you get control putting 
pushpins body surface 
so you put pushpins you 
constrain position 
putting pushpin a fix, 
location 
is fixed you get 
control 
yeah again, pushing we change 
lengths, 
propagation, so you move one part 
garment 
blankaudio 
we also use, painting interface 
changing 
position putting garment 
character 
so this is useful to make discontinuous 
unknown change, like this one, 
so you suddenly jump part cloth 
to arm 
blankaudio 
so here is a couple examples d 
models created using technique 
so here is an octopus, a mommy octopus 
so you put long garment, clothes 
octopus 
again, i think this is tedious to 
using standard dragging operation 
blankaudio 
this is something we wanted to 
using 
interface, is put clothing 
head 
you play around this 
blankaudio 
okay, so thats video 
so i said we propose is surface 
dragging 
so traditional approach is single vertex 
dragging, rigid 
dragging moves vertices 
direction 
here, we propose is propagation 
moving 
vector allowing to body to move slightly 
this way 
okay so let briefly describe 
implementation techniques, so 
wrapping dragging 
then, past experience wrapping always 
wins 
so wrapping is, i said, instead 
moving entire integrated entire 
clothes to body, we actually glue 
cloth body surface 
thats basic idea 
in this way, we operate discard 
clothing detection so 
so here is a look unknown 
thats beginning system fast computer 
dependency graph propagation graph 
starting painted triangle to 
triangles 
so this is a directive graph 
then, according to directive 
graph, dependence 
graph, we grows cloth to body 
surface 
so first, we transplant, d clothes to d 
surface 
we paste, a new triangles, one 
one, 
body surface, using, according to 
dependency graph 
an interesting question here is to 
grow surface 
please consider there two possible 
approaches 
one is you paste, triangle one one, 
pasting on, directly body 
another possibility is, instead 
directly painting, 
a kind straight a, along cloth 
surface 
we actually implemented first one, 
unknown approach 
however, we found problematic we 
switched to 
this planar growth, let describe a 
little 
so if you stick to body you a 
problem if you a, like a sleeve 
you know, if you start to make a sleeve 

sides, if you stick body here, there 
so many 
causes many many folds, you know, 
around here 
so we find problematic 
if you use a planar growth, works 
this way, 
afterwards physics will stitch together 
you will get a reasonable result 
heres another example, if you use 
stick to body, 
if you start growing here goes 
around body 
is desirable 
so we decided to use planar growth 
ruffle 
okay, so let move to 
dragging implementation 
so i said, dragging is to propagate 
motion along 
body vertices move 
together along body surface 
beginning as, soon you 
click 
start dragging, system fast compute 
this dependency graph propagation 
graph 
starting unknown vertices, vertex 
to rest vertices 
again, there two, two 
possibilities 
one is to propagate cloths, along 
cloths surface 
then, you know, you see vector 
you know vector changes along, across 
surface 
possibility is changes 
vector direction according to body 
surface 
then, we tested poles 
unknown naive approach 
this changing vector along body, 
upclose surface 
however, turned to ,very 
unstable shape changes 
time 
however, if we switch to body 
based propagation, body shape doesnt 
change 
is stable 
we found that this is much better 
so in summary, in this video we discussed 
clothing manipulation methods 
so we introduced painting 
interface wrapping 
also dragging along whole 
surface dragging 
following implementation, wrapping 
is achieved growing 
pasting triangles one one 
body surface 
dragging we propagate 
motion along body surface 
so to allow technique is 
published clothing manipulation 
if you want to know 
clothes simulation, yeah, there so 
many information 
i want to point to a 
famous, good paper called large steps in 
cloth simulation 
a little bit old paper, i think 
still 
popular a good starting point 
study 
thank you
