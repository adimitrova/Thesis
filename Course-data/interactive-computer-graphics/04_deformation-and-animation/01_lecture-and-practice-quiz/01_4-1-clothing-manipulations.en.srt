00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,952
[SOUND]

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:09,571
[BLANK_AUDIO]

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,166
hello.

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,310
This is Week 4 of Interactive Computer
Graphics Course.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,209
The topic of this week is Deformation and
Animation.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,418
So, last week we discussed the moving of
3D shapes.

7
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:25,650
They are kind of rigid shapes, there is no
deformation there is not motion.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,328
In this we discuss how to make them move,
how to make them form.

9
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:37,140
One way to change the pose of articulated
character, our frog.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,294
And the other possibility is, is to deform
the objects

11
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:46,623
consistent with deformed object like frogs
or robes or jellyfish [UNKNOWN].

12
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:49,673
And this as you see this is much more
difficult because there

13
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:53,772
are lots more information there the time
sequence for the articles positions.

14
00:00:53,772 --> 00:01:00,590
And then we will discuss [INAUDIBLE]
toughest to control so many information.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,200
So these are the topics we discussed here.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,530
The first one is Clothing Manipulations,
so putting garment on the character.

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,060
And the next one is Layer Operations for

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,290
controlling stacked clothes or robes, and
so on.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,040
And then, we will describe Spatial Key
Framing technique to animate character.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,297
And then also, the Procedural Deformation
technique for

21
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,885
animating jellyfish and other [UNKNOWN]
and so on.

22
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:30,064
And then, finally we will describe a

23
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:34,080
method to handle large motion capture
data.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,079
The first one is Clothing Manipulation.

25
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:43,190
So this is work titled as Clothing
Manipulation and published in 2002.

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:49,472
The problem we want to address here is
that clothing manipulation is difficult.

27
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:53,460
Many people are working on clothes
simulation, but I thought that

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,000
not so many people working on manipulation
or control of the clothing.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,260
So this is, these are a popular techniques
in the field.

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,272
The one poss, popular approach is to put
rigid clothes pieces along

31
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:14,740
the body and then start simulation and the
clothes will snap to the body.

32
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,380
This is very popular with clothes.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,020
However, from users point of view it's
very tedious to place piece

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,380
of clothing around the body with 3D
rotation and 3D position control.

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,344
And the other popular demonstration is
this

36
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:33,279
kind of real-time simulation of clothes
material.

37
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,073
But from user interest point of view,

38
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,159
it's like manipulating a handkerchief
using a chopstick.

39
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,880
It's not very good for putting clothing on
that character.

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,040
So what we want to do here, is a way to
make it

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,482
easy to put clothes on a character in a
very flex way, flexible way.

42
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:55,300
You know, there are so many different ways
to put clothing on a character.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,150
And we want to develop technique to make
it easy to test many variations.

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,040
Okay let me show you, a video.

45
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,667
So we introduce two techniques here,
wrapping

46
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:18,162
and then dragging, the first one is
wrapping.

47
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:20,105
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,785
So here you have a 3D character here, and

49
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,010
then we try to put clothing on this 3D
character.

50
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,150
And on the right hand you have a garment
editor.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,832
And then, you design a garment here as a
2D pattern.

52
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,890
So you will, you design a 2D shape, and
then put this garment onto this character.

53
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,816
And I just said, keep options to push and
pull, each individual

54
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:50,720
body, allowing this 3D body, it can be
very timing consuming and difficult.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,931
So our approach is to use painting
interface.

56
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,780
So user [UNKNOWN] specify which part
should go where.

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,040
So this line, these three lines should go
here, then here, and then here.

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,219
And then with this thing, the system tries
to put the

59
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,390
clothing on the character so that these
painted marks matches together.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,365
So just press the wrap button.

61
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:22,559
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:25,280
And then you will instantly get the final
shape.

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,002
And I think much more faster and efficient
than standard dragging operations.

64
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:35,634
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,090
So here's another example.

66
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,136
Here we tried to make our [UNKNOWN] and
then

67
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:45,403
we tried to put this garment on this
character.

68
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,010
So you draw lines here.

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,390
And then there is also a line here,
corresponding lines on this character.

70
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,930
And then just press wrap, and you suddenly
get [UNKNOWN] on this character.

71
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,420
And here is a little bit more complicated
example.

72
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,301
So you would paint four strokes and

73
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:12,698
then also corresponding strokes on the
character.

74
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:16,978
So in this way you can get a specific way
of putting the garment on the character

75
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,876
[BLANK_AUDIO]

76
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:24,190
Now here's a little bit more complicated
example.

77
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,870
So you can quickly design this kind of
t-shirt and then

78
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,340
a shirt and then you can put in this
garment.

79
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,580
Again, if you use traditional drag-ons
[INAUDIBLE] operations

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,565
it can be very tedious to control this.

81
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:48,498
[BLANK_AUDIO]

82
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,365
So this [UNKNOWN].

83
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:53,048
So instead of moving around the garment,
the

84
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:57,050
system actually grows a garment on this
character.

85
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,083
So next operation, is Surface dragging.

86
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,448
So after putting a garment on a character

87
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:04,460
you may want to relocate or adjust the
position.

88
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,934
And this is technique.

89
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:09,739
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:12,703
So here basically idea, so typical
dragging real

91
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:16,580
time clothes simulation is just move
single objects.

92
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,162
And then rely on physics to move around
the other vertices.

93
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:23,272
However, this is not convenient for making
a drastic,

94
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:26,394
a large deform, large motion around the
body surface.

95
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:36,394
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:43,040
So this here is an example of traditional
single vertex dragging.

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,870
So it can make a very local shape change,

98
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,489
but it's very hard to make a global
change.

99
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,830
So what people propose is called surface
dragging.

100
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,240
So as you drag a single vertex, the

101
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,130
the system dies, propogates motion
allowing the [UNKNOWN].

102
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,751
It allows a small motion, all bodies are
going to move

103
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,619
together, so you can make a big change
with a single drag.

104
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:12,569
[BLANK_AUDIO]

105
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:13,690
So here's an example.

106
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,758
So you can easily up or down or even

107
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:21,368
you can rotate the skirt around the body
surface.

108
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:23,699
And this kind of dynamic fast motion is

109
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,700
not possible with standard single vertex
simulation method.

110
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,750
So you can move this cloth along the body
surface.

111
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,823
[BLANK_AUDIO]

112
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:37,452
And the system also takes care of the
basic physics,

113
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:40,690
so there is no penetration, and then also
some gravity effect.

114
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,050
And you can get further control by putting
pushpins on the body surface.

115
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,800
So you can put pushpins and then you
constrain the position.

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,230
And after putting pushpin it's a fix, the
location

117
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,340
is fixed and than you can get further
control.

118
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:12,203
Yeah again, by pushing we can change
lengths, by

119
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:18,388
propagation, so you can just move one part
of the garment.

120
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:28,388
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,953
We can also use, some painting interface
for changing

122
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:44,010
the position after putting the garment on
the character.

123
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,263
So this is useful to make discontinuous
[UNKNOWN] change, like this one,

124
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,343
so you can suddenly jump part of the cloth
to the arm.

125
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:57,712
[BLANK_AUDIO]

126
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:01,639
So here is a couple of examples of 3D
models created using the technique.

127
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,630
So here is an octopus, a mommy octopus.

128
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,050
So you can put long garment, clothes on
the octopus.

129
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,153
And again, I think this is very tedious to
do using standard the dragging operation.

130
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:20,768
[BLANK_AUDIO]

131
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,044
And this is something we wanted to do
using

132
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,500
the interface, is can put clothing on her
head.

133
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,222
And you can play around with this.

134
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:31,362
[BLANK_AUDIO]

135
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,610
Okay, so that's video.

136
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,870
So as I said what we propose is surface
dragging.

137
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,670
So traditional approach is single vertex
dragging, or rigid

138
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,940
dragging moves all the vertices into the
same direction.

139
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,150
But here, what we propose is propagation
of moving

140
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,090
vector allowing to body to move slightly
this way.

141
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,130
Okay so let me briefly describe the

142
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,961
implementation of these techniques, so
wrapping and dragging.

143
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:03,680
And then, past experience wrapping always
wins.

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,090
So wrapping is, as I said, instead of
moving entire integrated entire

145
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,578
clothes to the body, we actually glue the
cloth on the body surface.

146
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:15,030
That's the basic idea.

147
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,150
In this way, we can operate discard
clothing detection and so on.

148
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,878
So here is a look at [UNKNOWN].

149
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:27,790
That's the beginning system fast computer
dependency graph or propagation graph.

150
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,300
Starting from the painted triangle to the
other triangles.

151
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,140
So this is a directive graph.

152
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,467
And then, according to the directive
graph, dependence

153
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:40,060
graph, we grows the cloth to the body
surface.

154
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,700
So first, we transplant, 2D clothes to 3D
surface.

155
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,470
And then we paste, a new triangles, one by
one,

156
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,930
on the body surface, using, according to
the dependency graph.

157
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,760
An interesting question here is how to
grow the surface.

158
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,870
Please consider there are two possible
approaches.

159
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,370
One is you paste, triangle one by one,
pasting on, directly on the body.

160
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,158
And another possibility is, instead of
directly painting, it's

161
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:20,779
a kind of more straight a, along the cloth
surface.

162
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,400
And we actually implemented the first one,
as [UNKNOWN] approach.

163
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,346
However, we found it problematic and we
then switched to

164
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:32,140
this planar growth, let me describe it a
little more.

165
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,270
So if you stick to the body you can have a
problem if you have a, like a sleeve.

166
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,500
You know, if you start to make a sleeve
from both

167
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,160
sides, if you stick the body here, there
are so many.

168
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,380
It causes many many folds, you know,
around here.

169
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,000
So we find it problematic.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,920
If you use a planar growth, then it works
this way, and then

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,330
afterwards physics will stitch together
and then you will get a reasonable result.

172
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,700
And here's another example, if you use
stick to body,

173
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,340
then if you start growing here it goes
around the body.

174
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,070
And it is not very desirable.

175
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,060
So we decided to use planar growth for the
ruffle.

176
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,940
Okay, so now let me move on to our
dragging implementation.

177
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,060
So as I said, dragging is to propagate the
motion along the

178
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,199
body and then all the vertices move
together along the body surface.

179
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,808
And at the beginning as, as soon as you
click down and

180
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,559
start dragging, system fast the compute

181
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,150
this again dependency graph or propagation
graph.

182
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,550
Starting from [UNKNOWN] vertices, vertex
and to the rest of the vertices.

183
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,020
Then again, there are two, two
possibilities.

184
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,950
One is to propagate cloth's, along the
cloth’s surface.

185
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,240
And then, you know, as you see the vector.

186
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,940
You know vector changes along, across
surface.

187
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,049
The other possibility is changes the

188
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,267
vector direction according to the body
surface.

189
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,135
And then, we again tested the poles.

190
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,757
And then the [UNKNOWN] naive approach was

191
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,910
this changing vector along the body,
up-close surface.

192
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,553
However, it turned out to be very ,very

193
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:22,240
unstable because he shape changes all the
time.

194
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,870
However, if we switch to body

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,860
based propagation, the body shape doesn't
change.

196
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,610
It is very stable.

197
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,350
We found that this is very much better.

198
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,572
So in summary, in this video we discussed
clothing manipulation methods.

199
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:42,476
So we introduced our our painting
interface for wrapping

200
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:46,387
and also our dragging along the whole
surface dragging.

201
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:50,477
And the following implementation, wrapping
is achieved by growing

202
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:54,450
or pasting triangles one by one on the
body surface.

203
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,209
And for the dragging we propagate some
motion along the body surface.

204
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,280
So to allow more the technique itself is
published as clothing manipulation.

205
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,330
And if you want to know more about

206
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,110
clothes simulation, yeah, there are so
many information.

207
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,050
But I just want to point to a very

208
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,100
famous, good paper called Large Steps in
Cloth Simulation.

209
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,410
It's a little bit old paper, but I think
still

210
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,220
very popular and a good starting point for
further study.

211
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,560
Thank you.
