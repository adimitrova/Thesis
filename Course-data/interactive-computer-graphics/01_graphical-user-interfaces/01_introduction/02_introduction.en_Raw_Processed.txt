sound welcome to course 
interactive computer graphics 
this is course introduction 
let first describe, we mean 
interactive computer graphics 
first this is real 
time rendering, this course is 
interaction 
noise specifically we discuss 
interactive 
techniques systems visual problem 
solving 
so 
let describe we mean visual 
problem solving 
so visual problem solving we mean, visual, 
visual aspects human intelligence 
i think visual problems consist 
three parts 
first you to understand incoming 
information, 
you to come a 
solution problem you 

to communicate idea to 
people 
this kind visual problem solving 
appears everywhere in professional 
daily activities 
as, example, medical doctors plan 
surgical 
operations, coaches teach to play 
sports 
product designers, architects, design 
products buildings 
costume designers design garments 
a scientist trying to understand 
nature 
activities involve intensive 
visual problem solving 
goal is to make processes 
efficient, productive pleasant 
using computer technique 
technologies 
leveraging interactive computer, 
interactive computing 
let know describe we mean 
interactive computing 
so let compare interactive computing 
old style command based interaction 
so old style interaction is command based, 
so user gives 
command to a system system a 
task 
user sees a result 
this is kind asking a computer, 
something 
interactive computing we mean 
like 
an augmentation human activities, like 
this 
so user continuously walks a 
program, system continuous 
provides feedback 
so this is kind walking stair we 
want to emphasize in this course 
so interactive computing is to augment 
human intelligence 
providing rich feedback in rapidly 
fast 
so continuously sup provide 
feedback 
the, accepts intuitive input, 
provide intuitive feedback 
behind scenes, should, 
tries to intelligent computation 
in this course, students will 
know to do, using an ios system 
so let explain course in 
broader context computer science 
computer science field is roughly 
divided fields 
theoretical field 
applied view 
among applied view, course is 
related 
to subfields called graphics 
visualization, humancomputer 
interaction 
and, so this course seen 
an introduction to computer 
science subfields 
let show you a couple topics we 
discuss in this course 
so first we will discuss influence to 
uh,to additional graphical user interface 
so we will describe to implement 
window operations, scrolling, icon 
manipulation so 
we me, move to d drawings 
so, we, well you to draw 
restorations also to move 

next week is d modeling 
so, we will describe to create d 
objects using dimensional input devices 
we would discuss to handle 
deformation 
animation objects closing 
lobes also flexible 
cough 
rebs object 
in last three weeks we, we 
move 
screen space go to 
real world 
so we first discuss to create physical 
object a threedimensional model in 
a computer 
we will discuss to 
leverage physical simulation to produce 
functional products 
finally we will describe 
introduction techniques that work 
computers systems interacting in 
real world robots 
this course is basically a casebased 
learning so lecture introduce example 
systems 
then, exercise help you obtain deeper, 
lasting, understanding topic 
course 
sample examples among many, many infinite 
possibilities 
studying points 
exploration 
so end topic, i will 
show information point is 
research 
study 
so in this course throughout 
examples students learn we 
also we 
interactive computing
