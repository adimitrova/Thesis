00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,916
[SOUND] Welcome to our course on

2
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:12,758
interactive computer graphics.

3
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:14,630
This is our course introduction.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,370
Let me first describe, what we mean by
interactive computer graphics.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,530
First this is not about real

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,972
time rendering, this course is about
interaction

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:30,494
[NOISE] and specifically we discuss
interactive

8
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:34,110
techniques and systems for visual problem
solving.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,610
So not.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,820
Let me describe what we mean by visual
problem solving.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,630
So visual problem solving we mean, visual,
all visual aspects of human intelligence.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,080
And I think visual problems consist of
three parts.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,240
First you have to understand incoming
information, and

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,150
then you have to come up with a

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,950
solution about the problem and then you
have

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,890
to communicate the idea to the other
people.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,460
And this kind of visual problem solving

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,970
appears everywhere in most professional
and daily activities.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,510
Such as, for example, medical doctors plan
surgical

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,690
operations, or coaches teach how to play
sports.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,260
And product designers, architects, design
products and buildings.

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,110
And costume designers design garments.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,970
And then a scientist trying to understand
nature.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,820
And all these activities involve intensive
visual problem solving.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,340
And our goal is to make these processes

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,510
more efficient, productive and pleasant
using computer technique.

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,640
Technologies.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,080
Leveraging interactive computer,
interactive computing.

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,470
Let me know describe what we mean by
interactive computing.

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,500
So let me compare interactive computing
with old style command based interaction.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,350
So old style interaction is command based,
so user gives

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,230
command to a system and then system does a
task.

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,930
And then user sees a result.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,310
And this is kind of asking a computer, do
something.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,660
But Interactive Computing we mean more
like

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,960
an augmentation of human activities, like
this.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,730
So user continuously walks on a

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,960
program, and then system continuous
provides feedback.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,439
So this is the kind of walking stair we
want to emphasize in this course.

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,900
So Interactive Computing is to augment
human intelligence by

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,270
providing rich feedback in very rapidly
and very fast.

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,450
And so it continuously sup provide
feedback.

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,020
And the, it accepts intuitive input, and
then provide intuitive feedback.

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,850
And then behind the scenes, it should,
tries to do some intelligent computation.

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,320
And in this course, the students will now
know how to do, using an IOS system.

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,190
So let me explain the course in the
broader context of computer science.

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,480
The computer science field is roughly
divided into 2 fields.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,780
Theoretical field.

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,290
And the applied view.

50
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,770
And among the applied view, our course is
related

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,410
to sub-fields called graphics

52
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,760
and visualization, and human-computer
interaction.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,060
And, so this course can be seen

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,024
as an introduction to these computer
science sub-fields.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,600
And let me show you a couple topics we
discuss in this course.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,330
So first we will discuss influence to
uh,to additional graphical user interface.

57
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,970
So we will describe how to implement

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,560
window operations, scrolling, icon
manipulation and so on.

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,540
And then we me, move on to 2D drawings.

60
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,090
So, we, we'll have you how to draw

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,440
restorations and then also how to move
them.

62
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,720
And then next week is 3D modeling.

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,710
So, we will describe how to create 3D
objects using 2 dimensional input devices.

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,620
And then we would discuss how to handle
deformation and

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,942
animation objects such as closing and
lobes and also flexible.

66
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:12,240
[COUGH]
rebs object.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,670
And then in the last three weeks we, we
move out

68
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,100
of the screen space and then go to the
real world.

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,530
So we first discuss how to create physical

70
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,560
object out of a three-dimensional model in
a computer.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,970
And then we will discuss how to

72
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,539
leverage physical simulation to produce
functional products.

73
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,520
And then finally we will describe
introduction techniques that work with

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,490
our computers or systems interacting in
the real world such as robots.

75
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,800
And this course is basically a case-based

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,160
learning so each lecture introduce example
or systems.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,540
And then, exercise help you obtain deeper,
lasting, understanding about the topic.

78
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,350
But of course these are just

79
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,410
sample examples among many, many infinite
possibilities.

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,560
And they are just studying points for
further exploration.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,890
So at the end of each topic, I will

82
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,750
show information and the point is for
further research.

83
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,060
Further study by yourself.

84
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,100
So in this course throughout these
examples students learn what we

85
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,570
can do and also how we can do it with
interactive computing.
