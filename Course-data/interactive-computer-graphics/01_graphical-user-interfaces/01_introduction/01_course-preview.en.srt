00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,158
[SOUND] Welcome to our course on

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:11,121
Interactive Computer Graphics.

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:16,053
In this course we will learn design and
implementation of interactive tools for

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,679
visual problem solving.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,660
Visual problem solving appears
everyday in our daily life.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,510
Medical doctors plan surgical operations.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,650
Coaches teach how to play sports.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,590
Engineers and
architects design products and buildings.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,000
And fashion designers design garments.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,910
Scientists try to understand nature.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,830
All these activities involve
intensive visual problem solving.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,050
And our goal is to have these
activities with computation tools.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,030
And they have.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,010
First, computers can help you
understand incoming visual information.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,210
And the second,

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,620
computers can help you come up with new
solutions based on this information.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,510
And finally, computers can help you
communicate these results to other people.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,740
In this course, we will introduce various
tools we developed in our groups.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,147
As example cases, topics include,
graphical user interfaces,

20
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:25,937
[SOUND] 2D Drawings, and [SOUND] 3D
modeling, and [SOUND] Fabrication,

21
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:31,452
and Computer-Aided Design, and
[SOUND] Real world interactions.

22
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:37,130
And then we'll show five demonstrations
on described implementation details.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,860
Stay tuned.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,782
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

25
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,450
Thank you.
