sound welcome to course 
interactive computer graphics 
in this course we will learn design 
implementation interactive tools 
visual problem solving 
visual problem solving appears 
everyday in daily life 
medical doctors plan surgical operations 
coaches teach to play sports 
engineers 
architects design products buildings 
fashion designers design garments 
scientists try to understand nature 
activities involve 
intensive visual problem solving 
goal is to 
activities computation tools 

first, computers help you 
understand incoming visual information 
second, 
computers help you come new 
solutions based this information 
finally, computers help you 
communicate results to people 
in this course, we will introduce various 
tools we developed in groups 
example cases, topics include, 
graphical user interfaces, 
sound d drawings, sound d 
modeling, sound fabrication, 
computeraided design, 
sound real world interactions 
well show five demonstrations 
described implementation details 
stay tuned 
im looking forward to seeing you 
thank you
