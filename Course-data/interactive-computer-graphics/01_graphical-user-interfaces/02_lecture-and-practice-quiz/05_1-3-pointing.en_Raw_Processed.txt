okay 
so, next topic is pointing 
so, we introduce here is called 
ninja cursors 
a problem we address here, is that 
very, 
difficult to point to a longdistance 
object far away 
so, today, screen resolution is gets 
higher higher 
screen gets bigger bigger 
you even multiple monitors 
so in, in a situation hard 
to 
get a point, a distant target 
mouse you 
to you know, move mouse many 
times to get 
target, so this is problem 
going to address 
we propose a message to address 
this problem 
let show you we 
so, yeah, here we discuss pointing 
mouse cursor 
this tedious if some, 
target is far away like this way 
so you to clutch marks many times 
blankaudio 
so in unknown program, we propose to 
use multiple cursors covering screen 
so here, we so, four cursors 
we, if we multiple cursors 
screen, 
you use a mouse cursor near 
target object 
so this save time pointing a 
distance 
target, thats technique we propose in 
this paper 
problem is that, ambiguity, so if 
you 
multiple cursors multiple objects 
in screen 
possible that, multiple pointers 
point to different targets a time 
so this is problematic 
sound so to address this problem we 
allow 
one cursor to point object a 
time 
so a mouse cursor is in 
object 
another, cursor needs to wait 
until cursor moves 
target 
so here, user moves mouse pointer 
to right continuously 
then, this one goes 
and, this one goes in 
next one becomes in waiting state 
so you see pointing 
inaudible pointers in a queue 
tries to, trying to point to 
object 
so, yeah let describe 
so basic idea ninja cursors is to 
cover 
screen multiple syncronizedly 
moving cursors, like this way 
user use nearest cursor 
to target object 
this one effectively reduce 
distance target 
so reduces average distance 
nearest cursor 
comes d 
to d divided square n 
so n means number cursors 
this one, this help you to point a 
distant, distant target 
way, this is a little bit 
background knowledge pointing 
so pointing is a popular topic in hca 
field 
pointing performer this models 
this 
kind equation, called fitts 
law 
so suppose you mouse cursor here, 
you try to point a target 
distance d, suppose that 
target size is w 
then, here we consider one 
dimensional motion 
in this situation target acquisition, 
pointing time is model like this 
time equals a plus b log b inside 
log is plus d divided w 
so means, if distance is longer, 
longer, 
time gets longer longer 
logarithmic function 
however, we, width is, is, get 
bigger time will reduced 
so thats equation 
ninja cursors, technique 
effectively reduces this d 
blankaudio 
we already discussed in 
video there is a ambiguity problem 
if multiple cursors point to multiple 
objects a time, this a problem 
so to address this problem we allow 
one cursor point to a target 
others blocked in waiting 
queue 
so here green cursor points to this object 
this 
red one in waiting queue, 
user continuously 
moves a mouse cursor to down, 
green one 
goes out, red one goes 
object 
we provide a visual feedback 
normal cursor, pointing cursor blocked 
cursor 
also, we also provide visual feedback 
waiting 
time 
so, yeah, thats heres 
summary 
so we discussed problem pointing a 
distant target a large high 
resolution displays 
solution is to show multiple 
cursors use nearest one 
we also describe to address 
ambiguity problems 
so original paper published ninja 
cursors, using 
multiple cursors to assist target 
acquisition large screens 
pointing is a very, popular topic 
in field 
in many publications 
here is a couple interesting recent 
papers 
one is bubbled cursors 
this mean, this bubble cursor 
technique changes 
mouse size, depending target 
density 
so if target is dense, mouse 
cursor gets smaller 
target is vast, mouse cursor 
gets larger 
so a interesting technique 
another is called drag pop, pop 
drag pick 
so you see here, you start to locate 
an object, related 
icons jumps to near cursor position to 
help you point 
to help you drag drop efficiently 
so thats 
thank you
