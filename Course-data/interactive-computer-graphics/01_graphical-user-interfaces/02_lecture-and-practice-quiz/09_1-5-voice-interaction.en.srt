1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,787
Hello, our topic here is voice
interaction, and

2
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:08,200
the work we introduce here is voice and
sound.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,700
So

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,945
here the background motivation, we see
there are two aspects in our voice.

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:18,270
So one is verbal information.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,960
And the other is non-verbal information.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,865
And typical speech interactions use verbal
information such as they

8
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:31,410
convert your speech into recognizable
command and then do something.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,940
But however, on the other hand, our voice
also contains

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,640
non verbal information such as pitch,
volume, speed, and so on.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,150
So these are non-verbal information has

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,128
been ignored in traditional speech
recognition.

13
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:48,317
But here, what we want to do is

14
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:52,710
leverage, leverage these non-verbal
information in your voice.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,098
And here is a kind of concept.

16
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,520
So, interaction turn-around is very long

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,430
in traditional voice or speech
recognition.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,340
So you say something, and then computer
tries to understand it,

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,770
and then you say something, and the system
tries to do something.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,540
And this is, this is very, very, very
time-consuming.

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,890
And it's very discontinuous.

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,590
On the other hand.

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,750
For example if you are working on a,
mouse, if you grab an

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,100
object, you continuously move your mouse
cursor

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,070
and then the system continuously provides
feedback.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,913
So this kind of direct manipulation
experience is

27
00:01:32,913 --> 00:01:35,950
what we want to achieve, as in computer.

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,890
So we, in our technique, the user
continuously produce makes your

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,980
voice, and then system continuously
provides feedback to your vocal input.

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,520
So let me show you a video.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,450
So, here, we introduce three techniques.

32
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,066
The first one is more simple.

33
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:58,660
On/off button.

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,150
So here, your voice works as on/off
button.

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,930
So if you say nothing, it's off.

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,790
So if you say something continuously it
means you press button.

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,540
Here's an example.

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,930
So here, typical approach is voice
recognition.

39
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,530
So if you want to move this node, say,

40
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,240
maybe you say 30 degree, and you get
result here.

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,450
And so, 90 degree, you get result here.

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,360
But again if you use voice recognition,
interaction can be very discontinuous.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,810
Here your voice is a switch, so if you
make voice this one

44
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,420
starts moving, as you, as soon as you stop
speeching, speaking it will stop.

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:49,089
So you can continuously see the visual
feedback [SOUND].

46
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:54,322
So as you see, you can continuously get
feedback, so if you get a satisfact

47
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:59,850
result, satisfactory result, you just stop
speech and you get a result.

48
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,340
And if the voice is very annoying or
difficult to produce

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,360
you can make any noise, so you can use a
breath.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,675
To control a system.

51
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:13,720
>> Down.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,660
>> And if you combine this with
traditional

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,370
speed recognition, you can do something
like this.

54
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,828
[SOUND] Again, traditional approach

55
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:29,762
is to say, like, 100 meter.

56
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:33,280
Away, or one kilometer away, and so on.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,230
But it's kind of difficult to understand
what's going on.

58
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,380
But here, you just speech, and then stop
speaking.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,690
And this especially useful for zooming.

60
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,630
You know, zooming 1.2 is very difficult to
imagine.

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,430
But here, you just see it.

62
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,930
>> Bike.

63
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:54,149
Zoom out.

64
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:56,251
Out.

65
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,654
Up.

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,060
Up.

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,760
>> Okay so that was a fast technique and
here is the second one.

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,684
Second one is addition to on and off, you
control, control a parameter

69
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:12,025
using a voice, using a pitch of your
voice, so you let me see.

70
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:21,473
[NOISE] So you control a slider with the
pitch of your voice.

71
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:30,448
[NOISE] It's very, very st, stable, that's
a most important part [NOISE].

72
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:34,664
>> Up.

73
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,899
Down.

74
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:37,570
Down.

75
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,560
>> So, here, in addition to controlling
the distance,

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,148
you can also control a speed of the
scrolling.

77
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:45,659
>> Up.

78
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:51,926
Right.

79
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,490
Up.

80
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,144
>> [NOISE] Again, higher the

81
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:04,689
voice, the faster you move.

82
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:10,050
So, so far, I showed very continuous
control parameters, but

83
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,822
here, the last one is discontinuous
Discrete Control by Tonguing.

84
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:21,469
So suppose you want to change TV channel,
or something like that.

85
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:22,414
>> [SOUND] down.

86
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,261
[UNKNOWN] Left.

87
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,181
[UNKNOWN] up.

88
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,005
[UNKNOWN] right.

89
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:33,865
[UNKNOWN] down [UNKNOWN].

90
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:38,141
>> So here we use very, very basic signal
processing, so you can

91
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:42,266
do any noise, so you can also clap your
hands to control it.

92
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,621
>> Down.

93
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,796
[SOUND] Right.

94
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:47,644
Right.

95
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,989
[SOUND].

96
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:53,476
[BLANK_AUDIO].

97
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,750
So those three techniques we introduced.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,100
And then next we, I will show

99
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,510
you a couple entertainment applications of
these techniques.

100
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,370
The first, okay,

101
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,140
the first one is jumping game using your
voice.

102
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,612
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, down.

103
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:19,884
>> So next

104
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:24,030
one is

105
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,410
using pitch control to control the
vertical position of this fish.

106
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:35,380
[INAUDIBLE]

107
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,715
So last one is, like punching game using
your voice.

108
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:47,145
[UNKNOWN].

109
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:55,758
[SOUND] So that, that's it and let me go
back to the slide.

110
00:06:55,758 --> 00:07:00,790
So let me briefly describe the
implementation of this kind of system.

111
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,610
First, where we use a signal processing
techniques.

112
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,175
And we use existing.

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,143
A fourier transform library.

114
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:13,360
So it transforms input voice signal data
into frequency domain.

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,140
And then application is control's
implemented in Java.

116
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,390
And the first technique, on and off
control is very, very nice.

117
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,670
Implement this and we use.

118
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,210
It just checks total volume, total power.

119
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,790
Or was the input signal.

120
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,470
And if it's, we check whether the total

121
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,810
volume is larger than the threshold or
not.

122
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,680
One implementation detail is that we
ignore

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,725
low frequency part to subtract, separate
background noise.

124
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:45,958
An important part is pitch detection, so.

125
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,380
We con, we use voice pitch to control
parameter up

126
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,030
and down but this needs to be very, very
stable.

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,000
A naive approach is to use identify
absolute pitch for each voice.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,850
So here's an input signal and then try to
identify the dominant pitch.

129
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,610
However this is very very difficult.

130
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,844
It's very ambiguous, noisy, and unstable.

131
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:14,580
Please imagine that at this kind of
frequency signal, is changing all

132
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,260
the time and then it is very difficult to
identify a peak.

133
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,120
So some t, at some point this is the
highest.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,470
But at nex,next moment this one gets
highest, so it's very unstable.

135
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,630
So this naive approach is not works very
well.

136
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,200
So our approach is to just all checks

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,760
slightly up or slightly down of each
frame.

138
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,780
So in this way the result is very stable.

139
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,110
So we only check whether the pitch is
getting high or lower, a little bit.

140
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,140
So here's a detailed algorithm.

141
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,620
Suppose you have this kind of spectrum of
time t0.

142
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,780
So the vertical, horizontal axis is
frequency, low frequency

143
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,650
to high frequency, and for each frequency
you get amplitude.

144
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,940
And then you get another thing now of t0
plus dt.

145
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,290
And then your task is to detect whether

146
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,240
this frequency signal is shifting
downwards or upwards.

147
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,460
So in order to do it, we get this

148
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,850
we aggregate this signal into a vector,
and then in the next time.

149
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,750
For the next fray, we get a vector for the

150
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,850
shifted upwards and also shifted
downwards, so you have three vectors.

151
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,240
And then we just compute dot products
between them.

152
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
So this one is dot product between v and v
minus.

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,208
And then you compute also v and v plus.

154
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:50,790
So if v minus is higher, then v minus is
more

155
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,490
closer to v, so which means that the pitch
is shifted over.

156
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,940
And then if this thought product of v plus
is higher than v minus, which means

157
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,650
that v plus is closer to v, which means
the spectrum is, gets higher.

158
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,850
So this very, very simple implementation.

159
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,490
Returns a very, very stable result.

160
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,130
So here's a summary.

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,416
So we discussed problem of controlling
object

162
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,760
continuously, using your voice, using
non-verbal features.

163
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,500
And then our approach is to use a
non-verbal aspect of your voice.

164
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,740
And the original paper was published as
Voice

165
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,460
as Sound, Non-verbal Voice Input for
Interactive Control.

166
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,680
And multi-modal interface using gesture
and voice is also a very popular topic in

167
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,780
your field, and very original paper was
called Put, Put That

168
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,790
There so you say, put and then say that,
showing some object.

169
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,620
And then again say there.

170
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,400
And they're showing another object using
your gesture.

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,030
And then you get the task.

172
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,040
And the video is available on the YouTube.

173
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,880
So I recommend you to take a look at it.

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
And also there are a couple of interesting
voice based interaction techniques.

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,270
And one recommendation for you is speech
completion.

176
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,300
And this one tries to complete.

177
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,638
Your speech in the middle.

178
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:23,020
And also video is available, so I
recommend you too take a look at it.

179
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,980
Thank you.

180
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,130
So this is the end of week one.

181
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,870
Some topic we discuss in this week was
graphical user interfaces.

182
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,170
And then we discuss scrolling interfaces,
the manageable desktop icons.

183
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,520
Pointing techniques on the large screen.

184
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,990
And management of digital ink.

185
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,218
And then finally, we discuss voice
interaction.

186
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:49,229
Thank you.
