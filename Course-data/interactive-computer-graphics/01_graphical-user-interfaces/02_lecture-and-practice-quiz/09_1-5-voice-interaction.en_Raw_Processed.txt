hello, topic here is voice 
interaction, 
work we introduce here is voice 
sound 
so 
here background motivation, we see 
there two aspects in voice 
so one is verbal information 
is nonverbal information 
typical speech interactions use verbal 
information 
convert speech recognizable 
command something 
however, hand, voice 
also contains 
non verbal information pitch, 
volume, speed, so 
so nonverbal information 
ignored in traditional speech 
recognition 
here, we want to is 
leverage, leverage nonverbal 
information in voice 
here is a kind concept 
so, interaction turnaround is long 
in traditional voice speech 
recognition 
so you say something, computer 
tries to understand it, 
you say something, system 
tries to something 
this is, this is very, very, 
timeconsuming 
discontinuous 
hand 
example if you working a, 
mouse, if you grab an 
object, you continuously move mouse 
cursor 
system continuously provides 
feedback 
so this kind direct manipulation 
experience is 
we want to achieve, in computer 
so we, in technique, user 
continuously produce makes 
voice, system continuously 
provides feedback to vocal input 
so let show you a video 
so, here, we introduce three techniques 
first one is simple 
onoff button 
so here, voice works onoff 
button 
so if you say nothing, 
so if you say something continuously 
means you press button 
heres an example 
so here, typical approach is voice 
recognition 
so if you want to move this node, say, 
maybe you say degree, you get 
result here 
so, degree, you get result here 
if you use voice recognition, 
interaction discontinuous 
here voice is a switch, so if you 
make voice this one 
starts moving, you, soon you stop 
speeching, speaking will stop 
so you continuously see visual 
feedback sound 
so you see, you continuously get 
feedback, so if you get a satisfact 
result, satisfactory result, you stop 
speech you get a result 
if voice is annoying 
difficult to produce 
you make noise, so you use a 
breath 
to control a system 

if you combine this 
traditional 
speed recognition, you something 
like this 
sound again, traditional approach 
is to say, like, meter 
away, one kilometer away, so 
kind difficult to understand 
whats going 
here, you speech, stop 
speaking 
this especially useful zooming 
you know, zooming is difficult to 
imagine 
here, you see 
bike 
zoom 



okay so that a fast technique 
here is second one 
second one is addition to off, you 
control, control a parameter 
using a voice, using a pitch 
voice, so you let see 
noise so you control a slider 
pitch voice 
noise very, st, stable, thats 
a important part noise 



so, here, in addition to controlling 
distance, 
you also control a speed 
scrolling 

right 

noise again, higher 
voice, faster you move 
so, so far, i showed continuous 
control parameters, 
here, last one is discontinuous 
discrete control tonguing 
so suppose you want to change tv channel, 
something like that 
sound 
unknown left 
unknown 
unknown right 
unknown unknown 
so here we use very, basic signal 
processing, so you 
noise, so you also clap 
hands to control 

sound right 
right 
sound 
blankaudio 
so three techniques we introduced 
next we, i will show 
you a couple entertainment applications 
techniques 
first, okay, 
first one is jumping game using 
voice 
up, up, up, up, up, up, up, 
so next 
one is 
using pitch control to control 
vertical position this fish 
inaudible 
so last one is, like punching game using 
voice 
unknown 
sound so that, thats let go 
back to slide 
so let briefly describe 
implementation this kind system 
first, we use a signal processing 
techniques 
we use existing 
a fourier transform library 
so transforms input voice signal data 
frequency domain 
application is controls 
implemented in java 
first technique, 
control is very, nice 
implement this we use 
checks total volume, total power 
input signal 
if its, we check whether total 
volume is larger threshold 

one implementation detail is that we 
ignore 
low frequency part to subtract, separate 
background noise 
an important part is pitch detection, so 
we con, we use voice pitch to control 
parameter 
this needs to very, 
stable 
a naive approach is to use identify 
absolute pitch voice 
so heres an input signal try to 
identify dominant pitch 
however this is difficult 
ambiguous, noisy, unstable 
please imagine that this kind 
frequency signal, is changing 
time is difficult to 
identify a peak 
so t, point this is 
highest 
nex,next moment this one gets 
highest, so unstable 
so this naive approach is works 
well 
so approach is to checks 
slightly slightly 
frame 
so in this way result is stable 
so we check whether pitch is 
getting high lower, a little bit 
so heres a detailed algorithm 
suppose you this kind spectrum 
time 
so vertical, horizontal axis is 
frequency, low frequency 
to high frequency, frequency 
you get amplitude 
you get another thing 
plus dt 
task is to detect whether 
this frequency signal is shifting 
downwards upwards 
so in order to it, we get this 
we aggregate this signal a vector, 
in next time 
next fray, we get a vector 
shifted upwards also shifted 
downwards, so you three vectors 
we compute dot products 
between 
so this one is dot product between v v 
minus 
you compute also v v plus 
so if v minus is higher, v minus is 

closer to v, so means that pitch 
is shifted 
if this thought product v plus 
is higher v minus, means 
that v plus is closer to v, means 
spectrum is, gets higher 
so this very, simple implementation 
returns a very, stable result 
so heres a summary 
so we discussed problem controlling 
object 
continuously, using voice, using 
nonverbal features 
approach is to use a 
nonverbal aspect voice 
original paper published 
voice 
sound, nonverbal voice input 
interactive control 
multimodal interface using gesture 
voice is also a popular topic in 
field, original paper 
called put, put that 
there so you say, put say that, 
showing object 
say there 
theyre showing another object using 
gesture 
you get task 
video is available youtube 
so i recommend you to take a look 
also there a couple interesting 
voice based interaction techniques 
one recommendation you is speech 
completion 
this one tries to complete 
speech in middle 
also video is available, so i 
recommend you take a look 
thank you 
so this is end week one 
topic we discuss in this week 
graphical user interfaces 
we discuss scrolling interfaces, 
manageable desktop icons 
pointing techniques large screen 
management digital ink 
finally, we discuss voice 
interaction 
thank you
