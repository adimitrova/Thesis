okay, next topic is desktop icons 
we will introduce here is called 
bubble 
clusters 
so topic we discuss here, is a 
management desktop icons 
so, suppose you a desktop one 
possible 
way, organized desktop is viewed 
special aggregation special clusters 
so, you put system icons here 
shortcuts here 
documents here documents 
topic here 
so, this way people manage, various 
information in limited space 
however, a program is this kind 
visual cluster 
is comprehensible a computer 
so theyre icons a computers 
point view 
so, whenever you have, you walk this 
kind 
a layout, you to explicitly select 
group objects 
so, thats one problem 
another problem is that you to, if 
you put 
many icons in a location, 
cause a cluster 
if you want to grab one icon hidden, 
behind icons, you to move 
icons away 
so thats a problem we want to address 
let describe program 
so here, you be, clearly see four groups 
here 
however, system understand 
kind clusters 
so, you to manually select move 
around you get a new 
group 
you again, you to manually 
select 
though, this tedious 
also, if you have, a big cluster, like 
this 
there you to pick up, icon hidden 

hidden behind 
you to manually move 
pick one object 
so, this is 
tedious 
so, we propose is, bubble clusters 
so, bubble clusters is automatic grouping 
nearby icons 
visualization in a 
bubble 
also, additionally, we introduce 
automatic spreading 
cluster to pick hidden icon 
so let go back to demonstration 
so here, you three grids, if you 
enable 
bubble clusters, you will see three 
bubbles, 
if you grab a bubble, you drag 
around 
by, grabbing a bubble, without 
manually selecting a group 
sound bubble, is automatically 
computed, 
soon you place two icons 
nearby 
theres a little bit small 
details interesting details 
here, two two, in 
distance, 
however you know, if two icons 
previously separated 
will resist to merged fast 
soon merged, 
start to resist to splitted 
so, this is, kind history resist 
is useful 
you can, you know, move around 
pick many icons 
then, if you a hidden icon, like 
this 
you double click here, 
you would temporarily spread icons 
you grab icon system go 
back to original state 
so, this is a bubble causal technique 
a bubble clusters technique, 
idea 
applicable to this kind digital 
ink 
so, if we walking digital ink 
system 
you know, you probably want to 
manipulate individual strokes 
rather that, cluster a 
meaning grouping 
then, whenever you draw strokes, 
system automatically groups nearby 
strokes together 
you move around strokes, 
grabbing blue area 
if you connect together, itll one 
object, 
you draw line you will split 
them, 
so this is useful a discussion 
a 
discussion whiteboard digital inks 
thats a demonstration 
let briefly describe essence 
implementation 
so, we, i will first describe clustering 
algorithm 
so, we use very, simple pairwise 
distance threshold 
so, objects screen, first 
we assign object to one cluster 
so, cluster object is like this 
then, object pairs, oi 
oj 
if distance is smaller threshold 
will merge to object 
heres a view 
so paper, pair, we check 
distance, one threshold 
if is smaller, we merge 
interesting part is here, 
threshold 
so, if the, if previously, in previous 
frame, if 
object in different cluster, 
threshold becomes small 
so, difficult to merge together 
then, if two objects 
cluster, in 
previous step, becomes larger, 
means easier to merge together 
a cluster, we regenerate 
a visualization bubble 
here, technology we use here, is 
d implicit surface 
so, implicit surface, is, to compute 
potential field 
field around element, place 
isosurface field 
so, suppose you one, two, three, 
four, five object 
we generate this kind potential field 
around it, kind height field 
we aggregate together 
compute isosurface 
here is a visualization 
sound so, if you this kind 
icons 
this will, this one showings 
potential field 
you see, if you aggregate 
object becomes brighter means 
high potential field 
that, we trace 
lines, 
height, heights 
and, however, timeconsuming, to 
process individual pixels 
so, we compute potential field values 
grid cells, like this 
computing potential fields 
grid cells, we, 
of, we, extract isosurface a technique 
called marching cubes 
so, heres a summary this video 
so, program we discuss here, is 
a management spatially organized 
miniicons desktop 
solution here 
we propose here, is automatic 
clustering nearby icons a bubble 
heres a pointers 
learning 
so, original paper published a 
bubble cluster, 
clusters an interface manipulating 
spacial aggregation graphical objects 
technique we use here, is called 
implicit surfaces 
implicit surfaces popular 
technique in 
computer graphics, to represent liquids 
inaudible object 
first publication siggraph 
jim blinn 
also, isosurface extraction 
technique, 
called marching cubes published 
this is a basic literature, i 
recommend that, to take a look 
thank you
