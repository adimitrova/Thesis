1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,940
Okay, our next topic is Desktop Icons.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,480
And what we will introduce here is called
Bubble

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,730
Clusters.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,160
So the topic we discuss here, is a
management of desktop icons.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,610
So, suppose you have a desktop and the one
possible

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,300
way, the organized desktop is viewed
special aggregation or special clusters.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,510
So, you put system icons here and
shortcuts here

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,770
and some documents here and documents on
other topic here.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,740
So, this way people can manage, various
information in limited space.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,390
However, a program is at this kind of
visual cluster.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,890
Is not comprehensible from a computer.

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,890
So they're just icons for a computer's
point of view.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,506
So, whenever you have, you walk on this
kind of

14
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:59,060
a layout, you have to explicitly select
group of objects.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,030
So, that's one problem.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,260
Another problem is that you have to, if
you put too

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,470
many icons in a same location, it can
cause a cluster.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,340
And if you want to grab one icon hidden,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,000
behind these icons, you have to move other
icons away.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,779
So that's a problem we want to address.

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,510
Let me describe the program.

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,670
So here, you be, clearly see four groups
here.

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,270
However, system does not understand these
kind of clusters.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,800
So, you have to manually select and move

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,995
around and then you should get a new
group.

26
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:35,265
Then you again, you have to manually
select.

27
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:38,253
Though, this can be very tedious.

28
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:42,560
Also, if you have, a big cluster, like
this

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,973
and there you have to pick up, icon hidden
it.

30
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,845
Hidden behind it.

31
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:50,020
You have to manually move out and then
pick one object.

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,520
So, this is

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,909
very tedious.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,530
So, what we propose is, Bubble Clusters.

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,190
So, Bubble Clusters is automatic grouping
of nearby icons.

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,120
And then visualization of them as in a
bubble.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,940
And also, additionally, we introduce
automatic spreading

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,519
of cluster to pick up on hidden icon.

39
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,140
So let me go back to the demonstration.

40
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,455
So here, you have three grids, and if you
enable

41
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:28,045
Bubble Clusters, you will see the three
bubbles, and then

42
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:31,275
if you grab a bubble, you can drag them
around

43
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:37,110
by, just by grabbing a bubble, without
manually selecting a group.

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,522
[SOUND] And bubble, is automatically
computed,

45
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:47,409
as soon as you place these two icons
nearby.

46
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,190
And there's a little bit very small
details but interesting details.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,830
Here, these two and these two, are in the
same distance,

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,740
however you know, if these two icons are
previously separated.

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,480
They will resist to be merged fast.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,130
But as soon as they are merged, then they
start to resist to be splitted.

51
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,410
So, this is, kind of history resist and it
is very useful.

52
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,040
And then you can, you know, move around
and pick up many icons.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,565
And then, if you have a hidden icon, like
this.

54
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:28,360
Then you can double click here, and then
you would temporarily spread icons

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,580
and then you grab icon and the system go
back to the original state.

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,160
So, this is a bubble causal technique.

57
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,190
And a bubble clusters technique, and then
same idea

58
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,950
can be applicable to this kind of digital
ink.

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,072
So, if we were walking on digital ink
system.

60
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:56,010
You know, you probably do not want to
manipulate individual strokes.

61
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,400
Rather than that, each cluster has a
meaning grouping.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,180
And then, whenever you draw strokes,

63
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,610
the system automatically groups nearby
strokes together.

64
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,890
And you can move around these strokes, by
grabbing blue area.

65
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,380
And if you connect together, it'll be one
object, and

66
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,030
then you can draw line and you will split
them,

67
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,460
so this is very useful for a discussion or
a

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,804
discussion on whiteboard or digital inks
because that's a demonstration.

69
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,810
Let me briefly describe the essence of
implementation.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,380
So, we, I will first describe clustering
algorithm.

71
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,510
So, we use very, very simple pair-wise
distance threshold.

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,510
So, for all objects on the screen, first
we assign each object to one cluster.

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,330
So, cluster of object is like this.

74
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,350
And then, for all object pairs, oi on the
oj.

75
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,320
If the distance is smaller than threshold.

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Then they will merge to object.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,420
Here's a view.

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,240
So for each paper, each pair, we check the
distance, against the one threshold.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,890
And if it is smaller, we merge them.

80
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,650
And interesting part is here, the
threshold.

81
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,860
So, if the, if previously, in the previous
frame, if the

82
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,680
object in the different cluster, then the
threshold becomes very small.

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,860
So, difficult to merge together.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,060
And then, if the two objects are from the
same cluster, in the

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,730
previous step, then it becomes larger,
which means very easier to merge together.

86
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,550
And after having a cluster, we regenerate
a visualization of the bubble.

87
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,130
And here, what technology we use here, is
2D Implicit Surface.

88
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,090
So, Implicit Surface, is, to compute
potential field.

89
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,500
Field around each element, and then place
iso-surface over the field.

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,970
So, suppose you have one, two, three,
four, five object and then

91
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,640
we generate this kind of potential field
around it, kind of height field.

92
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,080
And then we aggregate them together and
then compute iso-surface.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,110
And here is a visualization.

94
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,281
[SOUND] So, if you have this kind of
icons.

95
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:21,170
And then this will, this one showings
potential field.

96
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,520
As you see, if you aggregate more and more

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,330
object it becomes brighter which means
high potential field.

98
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,360
And after that, we just trace.

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,660
lines, with the same

100
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,740
height, heights.

101
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,200
And, however, it's very time-consuming, to
process individual pixels.

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,530
So, we compute potential field values at
grid cells, like this.

103
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,555
And after computing potential fields at
the grid cells, then we, out

104
00:06:55,555 --> 00:07:01,310
of, we, extract iso-surface by a technique
called Marching Cubes.

105
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,130
So, here's a summary of this video.

106
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,398
So, the program we discuss here, is

107
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:12,920
a management of spatially organized
mini-icons on desktop.

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,270
And then solution here.

109
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,270
What we propose here, is automatic
clustering of nearby icons as a bubble.

110
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,485
And here's a pointers for further
learning.

111
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,946
So, original paper was published as a
Bubble Cluster,

112
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:32,680
Clusters: An Interface for Manipulating
Spacial Aggregation of Graphical Objects.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,390
And the technique we use here, is called
Implicit Surfaces.

114
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,180
And Implicit Surfaces are very popular
technique in

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,583
computer graphics, to represent liquids
and [INAUDIBLE] object.

116
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:48,990
And the first publication was at SIGGRAPH
82 by Jim Blinn.

117
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,360
And then also, iso-surface extraction
technique,

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,490
called Marching Cubes was published at
1987.

119
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:01,610
And this is a very basic literature, and I
recommend that, to take a look at them.

120
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:01,930
Thank you.
