okay, next topic is beadwork design 
so work we introduce here is a beady 
interactive beadwork design 
construction 
program here is beadwork design 
so, bead work is add 
connecting beads together wires 
so, this is an example 
so you a d structure connecting 
small pieces connected a single wire 
construction is given, supplies given 
like this kind two dimensional figure 
so people looking 
this instruction 
put piece together 
one one using a wire 
to design construct design 
construction this kind d bead 
work is extremely difficult hard 
suppose you this kind shape 
tries to, 
want to make this head bigger, 
this arm longer 
in order to you cannot insert 
a bead art arbitrary location 
you know 
this is hard, 
complicated, hard, 
heavily constrained program 
so this is a program we want to address 
so to design this shape to 
guide user to construct shape 
approach is two ways 
so one is an interactive design, 
an interactive design construction 
so, a user designs this in, interesting 
bead work design shapes gestural, 
photogestural interaction, 
that system automatically constructs 
appropriate beadwork structure 
also system provides interactive guide to 
generate a physically construct, 
physical beadwork 
inside, we, system applies 
a wire path planning algorithm to 
compute efficient also easy 
to create wire path structure 
so, let show you a demo 
okay, heres demonstration system, 
modeling starts a base shape 
so you, we prepared a couple base shapes, 
lets use this one 
then, this shape, 
you already a simple shape 
so here, left one, so 
this one is a structure design mesh, 
so called design mesh 
so you work this structure 
level to design a mesh 
so this represents, 
basic core structure a final bead work 
right hand side 
is a simulation result 
result, actual bead work model 
so individual, shape is represent here 
system shows we 
generated this design, to this, 
result 
we provide gesture operation 
i click here, 
you add another primitive 
you instantly get structure 
system is internally learning 
continuously simple physical simulation so 
that, that resulting 
shape is always valid 
we implemented a couple simple 
gestures like this is extrusion, 
youll get extruded shape 
an extrusion, extruded shape 
you crop vertices, 
crop vertices 
you will get this shape 
you also split edge 
connect edge 
so essentially, user is editing 
topology mesh, 
physical simulation automatically 
compute geometry shape 
user specify is wire 
structure, connection between this 
final shape is automatically 
defined physics, 
putting piece together 
you also 
put this kind shape 
so in this way, you generate 
reasonably interesting shape 
editing topology simple, 
simple gesture operations 
system computes d shape 
youll get wire structure 
that you paint 
example you put eyes here, so 
this character, 
system computes the, 
you press this plan button 
system automatically 
computes wire plus 
system starts 
to giving instructions 
so this, this is an instruction 
so, here you see total steps 
current position 
system also provides feedback 
lengths wires 
this is instruction 
this says that, please put 
a single bead in a long wire here 
press next 
system shows to place next bead 
next next 
so course, construction is 
to done manually you 
so you put one one 
step, you press next 
system shows a visualize that is 
so yeah memorizing d graphics 
much easy to 
associate current physical bead in 
hand with, graphics screen 
so the, watching this instruction, 
you put bead one one, 
you will eventually 
get final result 
let show you a video 
so, again, this is overview system 
so, system allows user to generate 
simple gesture operations 
system provides 
construction guide 
you will get final bead 
work model, physical bead work 
so, yeah, geometric modeling is 
a process i demonstrated 
so let skip processes 
so that system shows a step 
step construction guide like this one 
so this is a situation 
a real construction 
so use a piece one one wire 
according to instruction shown 
screen 
let skip, so ill go here 
let show you a couple results 
so yeah, we created a couple bead works, 
original designs 
traditionally, i think design 
completed in bead work is so 
difficult so 
you go, we actually visit couple 
stores selling bead works 
many, many stores sells 
exactly designs 
here, you know, 
you design things 
so, this a interesting 
gift friends 
so, yeah, heres an example, like penguins 
lizards mouse a teddy bear, so 
so, let briefly describe 
core algorithm 
so, heres a view 
so this is design mesh 
so you design this a mesh, using gestures 
then, this design mesh, 
we convert this to a big work model 
first step is like this 
so edge is actually a single bead 
so reason we considered 
using a vertices outside edge, 
actually, you know, a bead, 
a wire passing 
so actually correspond to a edge 
so edge becomes a bead 
bead is connected wire, 
to neighboring beads, like this way 
so, first step is combine single input, 
combine design polyhedron to a 
complicated structure model 
then, next task is to put a wire seat 
this wire is given a eulerian 
circuit this structure graph you know 
eulerian circuit is visit 
individual to say 
in this case, 
basic individual edge, one one 
so, yeah, heres a brief 
overview computing wire paths 
but, however, one problem is 
that arbitrary euler cycle, 
euler socket is stable 
stable is, 
this, this is difficult to explain but, 
suppose you this structure 
yeah 
you five faces 
you this red path goes 
blue path goes 
connecting in 
final configuration, 
you will get final stable shape 
in the, in middle, 
while you creating, you have, 
also, an intermediate shape 
in this intermediate shape, 
beads moving around 
difficult to manually construct 
so in order to be, 
make easier to manually construct, 
process like this 
individual, wire close 
one one, based individual faces 
so, in, in intermediate 
status, faces closed one one 
so you wont to this 
system actually first 
computes a face strip, 
design mesh compute 
a wire, place wires along this face strip 
this face strip computation 
is given a hamiltonian path 
graph consisting faces 
so, yeah, 
this is a result stripification, 
computed hamiltonian path 
so, this path visits faces one one, 
we put wires, so 
that wires completes 
faces in this order 
so, yeah, thats original paper 
called bd published in 
step step in, 
instruction used in work, 
inspired a previous method designed 
instructions, step step 
furniture, 
core selection like this one 
also method also 
contains a conversion d, 
existing d mesh model to 
a simple bead work mesh 
this work is in, in this part 
is related to mesh simplification 
good one example paper is this 
one variational shape approximation 
so getting detailed d mesh 
simplification methods 
done simplified mesh 
this may interesting 
thing to learn 
thank you
