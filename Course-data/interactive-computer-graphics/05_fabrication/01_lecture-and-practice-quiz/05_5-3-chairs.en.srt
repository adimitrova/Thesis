1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,010
Our next topic is Chair Design.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,330
And the work we introduce
here is called SketchChair.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,980
So the problem to address here is that
design and construction of original chair.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,010
Suppose you want to design your own chair,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,812
instead of buying
something from the store.

6
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,030
And there're so
many issues to consider, you know?

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,260
You know that to work as a functional
chair you need to be physically valid.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,800
It should be stable and
it should not break if you sit down.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,220
And also it should be easy
to manually construct.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,590
So we present our design
system specialized for chairs.

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,560
So the design can be done
by easy sketching and

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,080
the system automatically checks
its balance, or stability.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,900
And also system automatically
generates a construction plan.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,311
So let me show you a demo.

15
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,830
So, yeah, here's the system.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,570
And then you design your own chair.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,470
For example, you have a chair
like this with a long back, and

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,890
we have a leg like this.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,570
So, I just draw three strokes, and

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,960
now you already have a 3D chair
moving like this one, and

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,590
then by pushing a print button that
you will get two dimensional pattern.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,730
So after that, you can just print this
into, send this data to a laser cutter,

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,940
and then the cutter automatically
cuts physical wood material and

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,440
then you can get a physical chair.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,450
So after having this designed,
you can also learn its physical validity.

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,265
So, we also have some additional features.

27
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:49,710
So if you press play button here, system
tries to push this guy on this chair.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,990
So here, it's fine.

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,140
You know, you can put down on
a character on this chair.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,270
However, if you,
you create unstable chair.

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,300
So let me show you
intentionally unstable chair.

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,270
For example, if you have a chair
like this and then if you put

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,400
leg in appropriate positions,
if you press Play, and then you know,

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,522
this is not very good, and then you,
you see that this is problematic.

35
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:21,140
So this is very simplistic,
this is just a starting point but

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,840
you see that physical validity checking
is possible, and then can be useful.

37
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,937
And let me show you a video.

38
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:37,350
So yeah.

39
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,710
I already showed a simple video,
a demonstration already, but

40
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,890
user draws a sketch, and then draw a leg,
and then you will get the 3D shape.

41
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,459
And then you can also additionally
edit the shape profile by

42
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,669
dragging to adjust the shape.

43
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,860
And we can also adjust the leg.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,441
So if you spend more time,
you're going to get more control.

45
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:13,480
You can also, you know, edit individual
layer to get more three dimensional shape.

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,798
So then you can progressively move on
to a more detailed design if you want.

47
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:34,848
Yeah as we see we also provide
the polygon tool and also tool and

48
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,479
also you can change
the spacing between the layers.

49
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:48,211
So, yeah, as I said the simulation, so
you can take the stability of the chair,

50
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,903
And also you gain stability of the chair,
rocking chair.

51
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,959
Yeah, as we see,

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,728
you can change the design while running
a physical summation if you want.

53
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:27,550
Now we also implemented a couple
of features to assist molding.

54
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,060
So this one is using of this
kind of accessory object.

55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,340
So you can see this kind of object
has a difference to design, here.

56
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,225
So use as designing a piano chair,
so you can see the size.

57
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,460
And it's not shown here, but

58
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,103
it's, you can also change the proportion
of the human figure if you want.

59
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:55,890
So this feature allows a user
to test many variations.

60
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,770
So after designing this one,
it's a previous one was hibernated.

61
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,236
So you can temporarily pan off on the,
you can test different one, and

62
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:08,504
then go back and
forth between different designs.

63
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,247
Okay, after our finish design,
then you can get this profile and

64
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,750
then you can send this to a printer.

65
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,170
So fast easiest way is to use
a cutting program with a paper cutter.

66
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,630
So you can send this to a paper cutter,
and then you can cut the paper.

67
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,415
And then you can get the paper chairs.

68
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,660
And this is cheapest way, so
you can generate many designs.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,424
You can do many designs studies
using this paper chair first.

70
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,202
Yeah.
After having a paper chair,

71
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:59,350
you can actually generate a big
one by using a laser cutter.

72
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,820
Laser cutter is very handy too.

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,410
So it's exactly like a printing machine.

74
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,520
You just send two dimensional data.

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,151
But then you will get this kind of
wood material cut by according to

76
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,126
the diagram and you get this.

77
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:21,112
And by putting cushions
around the surface, and

78
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:23,942
then you'll get a more realistic chair.

79
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,737
So here is some results.

80
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,399
So these are the variation
of paper chairs.

81
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,987
A rocking chair we just saw.

82
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:56,027
And then full sized chairs, like these.

83
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,027
And this is a piano chairs.

84
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:12,004
Yep, so, that's it.

85
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:17,219
Here's a couple of examples,
and so this is the big chair.

86
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,916
Yeah so we, this is a big chair,
I just saw, and

87
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,504
then so
I have a small chair like this one.

88
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:27,950
This is.

89
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,080
This can be a very good
sitting form placer.

90
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,970
Okay so we use physical simulation here.

91
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,040
We use an open source physics
engine rigid body simulation.

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,420
So we, we currently use bullet engine.

93
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,040
But there are many other possibilities.

94
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,040
So these physics engine is usually
used for games, you know, 3D games and

95
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,890
there are objects moving around,
bumping each other, but

96
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,400
these are now very popular, easy to use.

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,298
So you can pick any simulation engine into
your code and you can play along with it.

98
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,160
And I think this work is a very good
example of a new way of design seating.

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,780
We call it Meta-design.

100
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,200
So traditionally,
designers design final product directly.

101
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,840
Go through designers, design chair, so
designer just physical shape of a chair.

102
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,180
But here, in the future,
I think designers will not only just use

103
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,460
their physical shape, but also designers
needs to design, design processes.

104
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,500
So here in this project, designer or
us, we actually design a process.

105
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,831
And we de, define a process, and then
inside with this process and the user will

106
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:47,700
sketch and then system automatically
generates us, these number of 3D chair.

107
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,280
Depending, taking user input, but also
according to the designer's intention.

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,670
And I think this kind of meta
design process can be more and

109
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,120
more important in the future.

110
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,192
So, to learn more,
original paper was published as

111
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:07,067
SketchChair: An All-in-one chair
Design System for End-users.

112
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:11,056
And rigid-body simulation,
if you now want to know the technique on

113
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,840
implementation details,
if you want to implement by yourself,

114
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,560
recommended reading is Rigid-Body
Simulations, SIGGRAPH Course 1992.

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,880
But if you want to just use it,
there are many you know, packages.

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,008
And as for the furniture design,
I recommend you,

117
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:33,980
I recommend you to take a look at YouTube
video from Front Sketch Furniture.

118
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,089
So this is interesting artwork.

119
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,410
So user can try to sketch
furniture in this 3D space, and

120
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,218
then you will get physical
object using a 3D printer.

121
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,970
So, thank you.
