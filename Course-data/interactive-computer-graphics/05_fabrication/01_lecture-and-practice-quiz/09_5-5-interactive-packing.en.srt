1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,580
Our next topic is interactive packing.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,030
So, so far we've discussed design
system but here it's not design.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,350
It's a, assisting laser cutting.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,670
So the title, this word is titled
PacCam: Material Capture and

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,329
Interactive 2D Packing for Efficient
Material Usage on CNC Cutting Machines.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,550
So as a program we want to address these,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,220
how to make an efficient layout
within a given material.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,140
So if you have a laser cutter or
cutting process it opens a case.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,520
You cut out main materials and
then you get this kind of waste.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
But you still see many useful regions,
so this is a kind of waste.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,980
So we try to address this program,
introduce packing system.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,060
So our approach is to develop
our overlap free layout

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,810
that fits within the given material.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,260
So you capture the material with holes and
then we apply overlap free layout.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,130
And then you'll get more
efficient usage of the material.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,153
So, let me show you a video.

17
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:21,520
So, first you capture the device,
captures the material in this way.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,010
And the system will get this image.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,520
And after that, you put,
your pattern here.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,770
So this white is holes, hole,
and the red is, pieces.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,280
And the user interacts with and
manipulates it.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,570
But the system automatically
applies collision detection, so

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,820
there will be no overlap, all the time.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,950
And after that,

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,460
you send this data back to the laser
cutter, and then you will get the result.

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,134
And then there is no more waste.

27
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,210
So yeah, this one shows a motivation.

28
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,110
So this is a capturing process,
so we first need to calibrate.

29
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,960
So to do so
we put checkerboard patterns and

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,580
then system knows the correspondence
between the camera image.

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,130
And then your 3d your 2d coordinate.

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,550
And then after taking the picture,

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,790
a system applies image
processing to detect silhouette.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,780
And in order to develop
a packing user interface we

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,390
first run observational
study to ask people to.

36
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,207
Take a look how they use it and
then we design our interactive system.

37
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,160
So, basic structure is like this.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,940
Use a one by one moving around and
they do the layout.

39
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,200
So, you see here is temporarily
turning off the collision detection so

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,140
you can get more flexibility and
pure collision detection.

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:13,920
And we provided an operation to gather
pieces together, or push away on others.

42
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,209
So, here, we pull everything upwards.

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,250
And here is a couple of examples.

44
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,730
So this is also used for, for,

45
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:38,390
as an arrangement of, material
consisting of many different patterns.

46
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,970
So we proposed four techniques here.

47
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,630
The most single one is pushing.

48
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,904
So it's use a moving around and

49
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:57,200
then collision detection will
push other materials away.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,110
And second one is compress, so
if you select the materials or

51
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,840
select pieces and then do a simple
pinch gesture and then you needed

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,740
highlighted materials parts comes
together to have a pucked layout.

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,700
And then also we also implemented
a tilting operation, so

54
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,040
gather all of the pieces.

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,600
Move to one direction.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
And one interesting operation
is Collision Snapping.

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
As I said,
as the system also temporarily turned off

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,730
Collision Detection to get more freedom.

59
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,840
For example, if you want to pull
this blue one over to the other

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,590
side of the red one, you cannot do this if
you always running Collision Detection.

61
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,030
So in this case you know if
the user is putting away in

62
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,680
the system temporarily time of collision
detection then go to other side.

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,850
A little bit more detailed
explanation how it work.

64
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,620
So first user moves to other piece and
they just follows it.

65
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,250
And if there's a collision then
there's a collision force.

66
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,670
Again a reaction and
then it starts to rotate and

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,380
after rotation you have two collisions and
it stops there.

68
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,690
But as the user continually,
continuously dragging farther away,

69
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,510
then the system detects that there is
no way of passing through, however,

70
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,340
user still wants to do it.

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,130
So I, after passing some threshold the
system will go into this floating mode.

72
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,170
In this floating mode,

73
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,360
system temporarily turn off the collision
detection physics simulation.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,760
So this floating object just
follows the users dragging.

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,230
And, and after going back after
passing through the almost and

76
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,760
then the piece come back to the original,
collision mode.

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,220
So this is a collision snapping system,
So, again,

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,550
we use an open source
[INAUDIBLE] physics engine here.

79
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,760
Here, we only need a 2 dimensional
simple collision detection So

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,109
we use a box 2D physics engine.

81
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,790
So do a lot more,
original paper was published as PacCAM and

82
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,170
it was published in 2013.

83
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,978
And here we label it as
mult-touch interaction.

84
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:12,350
And multi-touch interaction
is very popular recently, and

85
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,459
many people are proposing
different techniques.

86
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,330
Very early one was published in 2002.

87
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,050
It was called smart scape and
I recommend you to take a look at it.

88
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,200
And also there are many interesting.,

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,800
There are a lot of interesting works.

90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,300
Introduction with razor cutting machines.

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,650
And one example is and

92
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,340
one interesting example is called
introduction construction.

93
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,940
Interactive publication of
functional mechanical devices.

94
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,990
What they do is,

95
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,850
the user uses a laser pointer on top
of a razor copter to dial to the space

96
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,500
where we have to caught on how to we
arrange the target shapes on the material.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,500
So, thank you and this is the end
of the fabrication section.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,080
So in this week,
we introduced plush toy design,

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,630
beadwork design chair design,
and design of soft folding.

100
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,180
And we finally introduced
interactive packing methods to

101
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,960
efficiently use the material.

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,460
Thank you.
