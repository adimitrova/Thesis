next topic is soft folding 
this is a work we published in 
so a program, we want to address is 
design softly folded shapes 
so origami others, paper folding 
is always sharp, rigid folds 
but, many things like, things 
designed weve crafted leather 
soft folds 
so motivation here is to assist design 
this kind softly folded object 
heres approach 
so traditionally sharp fold 
used in design origami 
folded shape, here we allow user 
to paint soft folds like this one 
you know, thin, 
narrow strokes represent a sharp fold, 
also this big, 
wide stroke represents soft folds 
so this is d user input 
given this d input, 
system automatically folds them, 
you will get d shape 
so thats a basic workflow 
so user paints flow map 
fold map 
use a system that d folded view 
in addition to it, study 
d fold to d model, 
system allows fast 
feedback you change control, 
thus change properties fold 
so, user interacts with, 
controls magnitude 
gives you a fold 
user also change 
sharpness individual folds, so 
you smoothly go back 
forth between sharp fold, smooth fold, 
sharp angle, angle so 
so, let show you 
so, yeah, heres basic operation 
so 
so user specifies a sharp fold here, 
you change angle 
you get this result 
so you see that user change 
fold angle system interactively, 
quickly shows folded result 
so this is far 
user is changing softness fold 
so, you, user is moving 
sharp fold to soft fold 
again, system continuously 
shows simulation folded result 
so this is a basic operations 
so combining this, 
we design multiple shapes 
so if you design curved line 
tries to you will get this result 
you also control 
softness this curved fold 
a couple examples 
so use interactively drawing folds 
system quickly provides feeder box so 
you explore many different 
designs using soft folds 
this spear is important 
you know, if you inaudible physical 
simulation, you inaudible dissolve, 
standard physical simulation 
is slow to this 
yeah, so use a space variety 
a soft fold 
change folding angle, 
you will get this shape 
so let skip this 
so here is an, another example 
so use sign wide fold here, 
fold, fold, 
fold 
start bending 
you see, 
contradictory force nicely 
handled a result computation 
so 
important point is that 
everything is interactive, so 
you incrementally add folds, 
test many fold angles 
looking d view 
changes configuration so 
so heres another example 
so user specifies sharp folds first 
specify a soft fold here 
here you specify 
connection between two corners 
you will get connected 
corners in d view 
heres another example 
i think this sequence is 
showing creation a mask 
yep 
okay, thats 
so, yeah a couple results, 
you know, 
this is sharp folds, this is soft 
folds, this is physical construction 
heres examples 
heres a laser bag design 
a shopping case masks shoes 
so let describe details 
so user input is given a fold map, 
sharp folds soft folds 
last one is d result 
in middle, 
a fast computer fold field 
so field computes gives 
orientation, magnitude, 
individual pixel 
so implementation 
so i use, i, 
input is given d vector graphics 
that we compute 
dimensional mesh 
twodimensional 
mesh vertices, 
we compute fold field one one 
coding 
fold field, 
means we specify forwarding angle, 
orientation, individual vertices 
then, assembling this information 
together, we get a global folding 
we would get a d result 
so, fold field generation works like this 
userspecified folds if you, 
first, system generates a mesh so 
that align fold curves tangent 
soft folds, 
we diffuse fold orientations in 
nonoverlapping regions 
overlapped regions, we 
blend overlap fold orientations together 
so if you this orientation folding, 
this orientation folding, 
you get in middle 
so getting a fold field, 
system computes a global folding, so, 
means assembling twodimensional 
local folds, you get a d fold 
important thing here is that 
we use physical simulation here, 
physics is slow 
instead we take a comparative 
geometric approach 
so here is overview 
so you get local folds, individual 
local regions folded independently 
we basically stitch 
together, to get global fold 
so in this d view, 
you get local fold, one one 
theyre stitched together 
then, eventually, 
you get a large fold 
technique we used here is 
borrowed previous work 
a linear rotationalivariant coordinates 
so to learn more, original paper 
published soft folding in 
there lots discussions 
developable surface control 
one starting point to look is 
flexible developable surfaces 
published in 
there a couple works 
origami folding, always folds 
one example is origami plane 
simulator in module space 
also origami assembly a lot 
interesting assemblies behind 
if you want more, 
i recommend you to take a look book 
titled geometric folding algorithms, 
linkages, origami, polyhedra 
thank you
