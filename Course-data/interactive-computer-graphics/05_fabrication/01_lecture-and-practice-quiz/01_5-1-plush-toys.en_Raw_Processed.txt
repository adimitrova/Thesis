hello, this is week 
interactive computer graphics 
a topic we discuss here is fabrication 
so, so far, we working on, 
introduced, discussed computer graphics 
so display imagery screen 
everything computer 
screen inside a computer 
so this week, we discussed trying to 
going computer screen 
try to work physical object we 
touch manipulate in real world 
background motivation is here, 
so you know there so 
many possible publication machines 
getting available, getting cheaper 
so if you a d model inside 
a computer, you easily directly print 
d models physical objects 
example, if you a d printer, 
you get a d model 
similarly, milling machines 
automatically mills, material 
you get d model 
so you have, d dimensional patterns 
you easily send to laser 
cutter, cutting machine 
you will get nice three, 
two dimensional shapes box 
so, heres list 
topics we discussed here 
we discussed design plush toys 
design beadworks chairs 
also discussed soft folding 
crossing materials, 
also interactive packing, packing method 
so first one is a plush toy design 
so this one is called plushie 
so program is address is that 
is difficult non experts, 
us to design d pattern 
stuck inaudible appropriately 
you know 
you want to get a threedimensional 
stuffed animal, 
you need to design 
twodimensional clothes patterns 
experts, may easy to 
understand relationship, 
novice users noexperience people, 
difficult to go back course 
between d to d d to d 
so, sketchbased d modeling 
automatic close pattern generation 
so this is extension 
teddy system we introduced 
so you sketch desired shape, 
system generates a three dimensional, 
geometry 
time, 
system also generates 
a corresponding d cloth pattern 
so if user print them, cut them, 
stitch together, ready 
youll get d, 
physical d shape 
so thats idea 
let show you a video 
so heres overview 
user input is threedimensional 
sketching input computer screen 
then, giving user input system 
automatically generate a d shape 
corresponding d equals patterns 
closing patterns, 
user sew together 
you get physical stuffed animal 
there operational 
user interface is similar 
to original teddy system 
user get outline, 
system 
time you get 
a twodimensional cross pattern, 
whats happening here inside is that we 
learn a simple physical simulation inside 
so system predicts happens 
if you stitch together 
system shows 
a predicted d geometry here 
geometry, 
you interact edit 
like like system, you cut object 
system automatically gets 
d shape well 
a twodimensional close pattern 
so user continuously edits shape, 
system continuously presents 
a twodimensional shape 
this is a operation 
so here we generate two 
possible operations 
so one is like this one 
so last base holes also, 
we also support inaudible this 
is useful making an ear 
we also implemented a cover editing 
operations pulling shape 
so here system concurrently edits, 
modifies d shape 
also twodimensional patterns 
this is in, in, interesting so 
you actively add 
erase a seams top a colored pattern 
so this is interesting i think 
so, you have, we three pieces 
a single d object 
if, 
here user tries to erase seam, 
means that two 
parties will merged together 
so you will end two parties 
system outlines this 
computation in real time 
so user erases a patch boundary, 
system merges two patches together, 
you will a two, 
patches, 
system also applies physical 
simulation to result 
so user also operate 
directly d pattern, 
you will get a modified d shape 
so you easily directly 
working d shape, 
you work, 
directly working d pattern 
so this two way agent 
flexible 
this is an example 
modeling sequence 
so use a fast generator base shape, 
you operate cut operation 
to get control 
so basically repeating 
simple sketching, 
editing operations, you generate 
reasonably complicated shape 
here we, we show in this video, 
in actual printout, system also 
gives, hints information, which, 
edge to connected end 
so, construction is also guided 
computer generated annotations 
so this d model, 
user print this pattern paper 
cloth you will manually 
create d stuff animal 
so this is d model, this is 
a generated real physical stuffed animal 
so you take four 
five hours to get this 
yeah, you also create a big 
one using, you know, inflation 
so this is a big balloon, 
like two meter size, a big balloon 
so traditionally this kind balloon is 
designed professional designers, 
requires many testing 
trials prototyping 
here, computer take care 
prototyping simulation 
so even inexperienced people 
design it, so, balloons 
so we learned simple study 
so, we asked kids to design 
stuffed animal 
so traditionally, 
people buy existing pattern 
create, stuffed animal 
almost impossible to design new 
original character, stuffed animal 
here, you know, even students, 
kids design stuffed animal 
finishing design, you know 
print cut stitch together, 
you will get a final d model, 
oh no, no, final press toy 
so, you design 
original model 
yep 
so, let briefly, 
describe algorithm 
inflation algorithm, 
inflation simulation, we use a very, 
simple, basic massspring method 
so, close d model mesh vertices 
move outward time 
air pressure cotton pressure 
so tries to inflate 
time system 
tries to pull back, 
depending edge length 
if edge length is long 
will pull back 
we repeat two processes, 

end you will 
get a stable result 
we must say that this simulation is 
accurate simulation real physics 
there will bonds physical 
simulation methods, you get 
accurate result using accurate 
methods is also interesting to 
see that you get basic result 
basic simple simulation method 
another interesting issue is that 
adjustment to sha, to patterns 
so, so, algorithm first takes user inputs, 
this red one 
direct to the, 
use a d pattern 
however, if you start d pattern 
inflate it, 
you know, 
inflated you inflate in z direction 
if you pull in d direction x y 
frame becomes gets smaller right 
so in order to prevent it, 
system tries to adjust shape 
to compensate this difference 
so after, initial configuration, 
system tries to gradually 
inflate d pattern so 
that resulting d inflation result 
matches exactly to d input sketch 
so thats, you know, 
inflation algorithm you saw in video 
so this shape adjustment 
is important 
you know, if user draw let, 
box, a input, 
if you dive to use this 
box a d cross pattern, 
if you generate a d shape 
d shape, you will get shape 
so resulting shape is 
exactly match this rectangle 
if we apply shape 
adjustment maths algorithm, 
system automatically 
inflates input to shape 
physical result will, 
publication result matches, 
closer to rectangle 
so, yeah, this is interesting 
so if you want to a rectangular, 
pillow, 
you start this kind 
pattern, start here 
so, to learn more, 
original paper published plushie, 
an interactive design system 
plush toys 
this work, strongly inspired 
previous work paper craft model 
so this work making paper 
craft toys meshes using 
strip based approximate unfolding 
so this one starts giving d model, 
automatically generates 
a d paper craft pattern 
so you generate interesting, 
d shapes using a paper craft 
we use a surface flattening method 
to generate moving d to d 
surface flattening is also a 
popular topic in computer graphics 
used to compute a texture map 
coordinates, if you learn more, 
one starting point would this 
mesh parameterization method 
applications 
so thats inaudible this week
