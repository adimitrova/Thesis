next topic is interactive packing 
so, so far weve discussed design 
system here design 
a, assisting laser cutting 
so title, this word is titled 
paccam material capture 
interactive d packing efficient 
material usage cnc cutting machines 
so a program we want to address these, 
to make an efficient layout 
within a given material 
so if you a laser cutter 
cutting process opens a case 
you cut main materials 
you get this kind waste 
you still see many useful regions, 
so this is a kind waste 
so we try to address this program, 
introduce packing system 
so approach is to develop 
overlap free layout 
that fits within given material 
so you capture material holes 
we apply overlap free layout 
youll get 
efficient usage material 
so, let show you a video 
so, first you capture device, 
captures material in this way 
system will get this image 
that, you put, 
pattern here 
so this white is holes, hole, 
red is, pieces 
user interacts 
manipulates 
system automatically 
applies collision detection, so 
there will overlap, time 
that, 
you send this data back to laser 
cutter, you will get result 
there is waste 
so yeah, this one shows a motivation 
so this is a capturing process, 
so we first need to calibrate 
so to so 
we put checkerboard patterns 
system knows correspondence 
between camera image 
d d coordinate 
taking picture, 
a system applies image 
processing to detect silhouette 
in order to develop 
a packing user interface we 
first run observational 
study to ask people to 
take a look use 
we design interactive system 
so, basic structure is like this 
use a one one moving around 
layout 
so, you see here is temporarily 
turning collision detection so 
you get flexibility 
pure collision detection 
we provided an operation to gather 
pieces together, push away others 
so, here, we pull everything upwards 
here is a couple examples 
so this is also used for, for, 
an arrangement of, material 
consisting many different patterns 
so we proposed four techniques here 
single one is pushing 
so use a moving around 
collision detection will 
push materials away 
second one is compress, so 
if you select materials 
select pieces a simple 
pinch gesture you needed 
highlighted materials parts comes 
together to a pucked layout 
also we also implemented 
a tilting operation, so 
gather pieces 
move to one direction 
one interesting operation 
is collision snapping 
i said, 
system also temporarily turned 
collision detection to get freedom 
example, if you want to pull 
this blue one to 
side red one, you cannot this if 
you always running collision detection 
so in this case you know if 
user is putting away in 
system temporarily time collision 
detection go to side 
a little bit detailed 
explanation work 
so first user moves to piece 
follows 
if theres a collision 
theres a collision force 
a reaction 
starts to rotate 
rotation you two collisions 
stops there 
user continually, 
continuously dragging farther away, 
system detects that there is 
way passing through, however, 
user still wants to 
so i, passing threshold 
system will go this floating mode 
in this floating mode, 
system temporarily turn collision 
detection physics simulation 
so this floating object 
follows users dragging 
and, going back 
passing almost 
piece come back to original, 
collision mode 
so this is a collision snapping system, 
so, again, 
we use an open source 
inaudible physics engine here 
here, we need a dimensional 
simple collision detection so 
we use a box d physics engine 
so a lot more, 
original paper published paccam 
published in 
here we label 
multtouch interaction 
multitouch interaction 
is popular recently, 
many people proposing 
different techniques 
early one published in 
called smart scape 
i recommend you to take a look 
also there many interesting, 
there a lot interesting works 
introduction razor cutting machines 
one example is 
one interesting example is called 
introduction construction 
interactive publication 
functional mechanical devices 
is, 
user uses a laser pointer top 
a razor copter to dial to space 
we to caught to we 
arrange target shapes material 
so, thank you this is end 
fabrication section 
so in this week, 
we introduced plush toy design, 
beadwork design chair design, 
design soft folding 
we finally introduced 
interactive packing methods to 
efficiently use material 
thank you
