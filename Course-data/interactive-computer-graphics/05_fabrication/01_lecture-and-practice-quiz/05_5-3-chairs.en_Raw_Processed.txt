next topic is chair design 
work we introduce 
here is called sketchchair 
so problem to address here is that 
design construction original chair 
suppose you want to design chair, 
instead buying 
something store 
therere so 
many issues to consider, you know 
you know that to work a functional 
chair you need to physically valid 
stable 
break if you sit 
also easy 
to manually construct 
so we present design 
system specialized chairs 
so design done 
easy sketching 
system automatically checks 
balance, stability 
also system automatically 
generates a construction plan 
so let show you a demo 
so, yeah, heres system 
you design chair 
example, you a chair 
like this a long back, 
we a leg like this 
so, i draw three strokes, 
you already a d chair 
moving like this one, 
pushing a print button that 
you will get two dimensional pattern 
so that, you print this 
into, send this data to a laser cutter, 
cutter automatically 
cuts physical wood material 
you get a physical chair 
so this designed, 
you also learn physical validity 
so, we also additional features 
so if you press play button here, system 
tries to push this guy this chair 
so here, fine 
you know, you put 
a character this chair 
however, if you, 
you create unstable chair 
so let show you 
intentionally unstable chair 
example, if you a chair 
like this if you put 
leg in appropriate positions, 
if you press play, you know, 
this is good, you, 
you see that this is problematic 
so this is simplistic, 
this is a starting point 
you see that physical validity checking 
is possible, useful 
let show you a video 
so yeah 
i already showed a simple video, 
a demonstration already, 
user draws a sketch, draw a leg, 
you will get d shape 
you also additionally 
edit shape profile 
dragging to adjust shape 
we also adjust leg 
so if you spend time, 
youre going to get control 
you also, you know, edit individual 
layer to get three dimensional shape 
so you progressively move 
to a detailed design if you want 
yeah we see we also provide 
polygon tool also tool 
also you change 
spacing between layers 
so, yeah, i said simulation, so 
you take stability chair, 
also you gain stability chair, 
rocking chair 
yeah, we see, 
you change design while running 
a physical summation if you want 
we also implemented a couple 
features to assist molding 
so this one is using this 
kind accessory object 
so you see this kind object 
a difference to design, here 
so use designing a piano chair, 
so you see size 
shown here, 
its, you also change proportion 
human figure if you want 
so this feature allows a user 
to test many variations 
so designing this one, 
a previous one hibernated 
so you temporarily pan the, 
you test different one, 
go back 
forth between different designs 
okay, finish design, 
you get this profile 
you send this to a printer 
so fast easiest way is to use 
a cutting program a paper cutter 
so you send this to a paper cutter, 
you cut paper 
you get paper chairs 
this is cheapest way, so 
you generate many designs 
you many designs studies 
using this paper chair first 
yeah 
a paper chair, 
you actually generate a big 
one using a laser cutter 
laser cutter is handy 
so exactly like a printing machine 
you send two dimensional data 
you will get this kind 
wood material cut according to 
diagram you get this 
putting cushions 
around surface, 
youll get a realistic chair 
so here is results 
so variation 
paper chairs 
a rocking chair we saw 
full sized chairs, like 
this is a piano chairs 
yep, so, thats 
heres a couple examples, 
so this is big chair 
yeah so we, this is a big chair, 
i saw, 
so 
i a small chair like this one 
this is 
this a good 
sitting form placer 
okay so we use physical simulation here 
we use an open source physics 
engine rigid body simulation 
so we, we currently use bullet engine 
there many possibilities 
so physics engine is usually 
used games, you know, d games 
there objects moving around, 
bumping other, 
popular, easy to use 
so you pick simulation engine 
code you play along 
i think this work is a good 
example a new way design seating 
we call metadesign 
so traditionally, 
designers design final product directly 
go designers, design chair, so 
designer physical shape a chair 
here, in future, 
i think designers will use 
physical shape, also designers 
needs to design, design processes 
so here in this project, designer 
us, we actually design a process 
we de, define a process, 
inside this process user will 
sketch system automatically 
generates us, number d chair 
depending, taking user input, also 
according to designers intention 
i think this kind meta 
design process 
important in future 
so, to learn more, 
original paper published 
sketchchair an allinone chair 
design system endusers 
rigidbody simulation, 
if you want to know technique 
implementation details, 
if you want to implement yourself, 
recommended reading is rigidbody 
simulations, siggraph course 
if you want to use it, 
there many you know, packages 
furniture design, 
i recommend you, 
i recommend you to take a look youtube 
video front sketch furniture 
so this is interesting artwork 
so user try to sketch 
furniture in this d space, 
you will get physical 
object using a d printer 
so, thank you
