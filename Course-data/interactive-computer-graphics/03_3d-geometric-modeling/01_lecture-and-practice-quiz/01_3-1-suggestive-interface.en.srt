00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,750
[SOUND] Hi, this is Interactive

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,141
Computer Graphics, week three.

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:17,016
The topic we discuss here is 3D geometric
modeling.

4
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:24,080
So the challenge behind this is user
interface is still mostly two-dimensional.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,620
So, the question is how to compliment in
missing information?

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,040
So, mainly depths here.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,210
So use [UNKNOWN] 2D and how to get 3D from
2D.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,810
There's lots of problem with our progress
here.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,110
Our solution, in general, is a user

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,800
interface, an automatic inference
leveraging domain specific knowledge.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,650
So if you do not know what you do, it's
almost impossible to infer dips, but if

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,130
you know what you want to do, if you

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,150
limit the domain and you can get
reasonable results.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,630
That's the basic idea behind the works I
will introduce here.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,630
And here are the topics that we will
discuss in this week.

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,670
So first one is suggestive user interface
for modeling of architectural models.

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,780
And then there's sketch-based modeling of
larger and stuffed things.

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,070
And then we discuss shape control by
curves,

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,839
and then flower modeling, and then
volumetric texture synthesis.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,260
The first one is suggestive interface.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,600
So, the work was published as Chateau, a
suggestive interface for 3D modeling.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,972
The motivation is here.

23
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:36,800
So current graphical user interface is
dominated through

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,080
these many buttons, menus, and even more,
nested menus.

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:49,965
It's very hard to find design command
[UNKNOWN].

26
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:54,968
[UNKNOWN]
About

27
00:01:54,968 --> 00:02:00,598
the operation on what

28
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:06,540
you want to do on the main screen, the
main field.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,550
So if we were working on 3D modeling and
if you want to do related to these three

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,560
elements in the scene you can just
highlight these

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,000
three, which hints the computer to infer
the request.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,310
And then computer looks at the hints,

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,440
and then provides proposal, for the data
operations.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,960
In this case, the system proposes a box,
and those are our two possibilities.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,600
So, in other words, review the first given
arguments

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,760
for the command, and then system
automatically infer the command.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,030
So let me show you a demo.

38
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,740
So here is a three-dimensional modeling
system with a 3D

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,730
space inside, and then you can sketch
lines in this way.

40
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,050
But here, instead of using many commands
on the menu.

41
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,490
We simply allow the user to highlight
lines.

42
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:11,000
And then, for these highlights or hints,
system pro, pro presents some suggestions.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, why is drawing a plane and another
is

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,730
drawing triangle, the other is drawing a
left angle.

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,970
And you can also ignore them and then
create more.

46
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,580
And then given the in-sweep of [UNKNOWN]
lines, system

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,960
predicts, or suggests to make a rectangle,
a box.

48
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,990
And then, again, if you do a line here,

49
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,360
then given this hint, system suggests to
cut a box.

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,540
You can also go back and then add more
lines.

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,670
And then given this hint, system suggests
to cut a corner.

52
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,440
So in this way, user provides the hints

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,590
to the system and then the system presents
suggestions.

54
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,650
So, this way, user does not really quiet
the space [UNKNOWN] one, in the

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,069
huge command [UNKNOWN], And then you can
forecast the visual content of the task.

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,440
And if you highlight this, then the system
predicts, or suggests

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,820
drawing plane, and the user draws for
example rectangle, triangle here.

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,800
And if you highlight these three, system
suggests to make a face inside.

59
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,520
And then if you highlight one more, the
system suggests extrusion.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,290
And one interesting operation is like this
one.

61
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,630
If you highlight these two and also one
line here, about a third.

62
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,370
And this is, it was exactly dividing to
the three.

63
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,380
We use again also the line somewhere here,
and this is [UNKNOWN] divided into four.

64
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,702
So in this way a user can generate

65
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:48,007
this kind of diagram just by, computing
operations.

66
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:57,644
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,828
And after some time operations, you can
get these kinds of results.

68
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:04,602
And this kind of operation is very useful
for

69
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:09,910
repetitions, and also some symmetric
structures and so on.

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,160
Now, let me describe, briefly describe,
the implementation behind the, system.

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,060
So, this is the input scene.

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,660
So highlighted elements and then no
highlighted elements.

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,990
So, taking this example input scene then

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,020
system is equipped with multiple
suggestion engines,

75
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,390
they kind of parallel engines working
independently

76
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,600
and then each engine consists of two
parts.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,310
One is examination part and one other is
generator.

78
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,860
And the examiner examines the scene, and
then

79
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,860
tests whether the scene matches with
expected rule.

80
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,950
And then if it passes examination, and

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,270
then the generator generates the resulting
scene.

82
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,790
So this is a very hardcoded program,
program module provided the programmer.

83
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,770
But they all works in parallel.

84
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,950
And then specific engine and the act of
specific input configuration.

85
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,300
And here's our list of suggestion engines.

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,960
We input method in this application.

87
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,910
One is [UNKNOWN] given a hint.

88
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,730
System generator [UNKNOWN] passing through
the hint.

89
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,922
And also if you highlight closed roof, it
suggest polygon, perpendicular two lines

90
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:30,534
suggest rectangle, [UNKNOWN] suggest a
box,

91
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:34,150
and system suggest extrusion and pyramid
shape.

92
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,556
Now these are resizing and bridges,
connecting two,

93
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:47,352
two polygons and the extrusion and this is
a cutting out

94
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:53,400
and also corner cutting and trimming and
intersection,

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,080
duplication, repetition, mirror image and
so on.

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,070
And the philosophy or concept is defined
as this.

97
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,990
Standard user interface is like this.

98
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,230
So the user provides very explicit command

99
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,350
or very explicit instruction to the
computer.

100
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,380
And then the computer just blindly, simply
follows the instruction.

101
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,560
However, what we provide is more friendly,
human to human like interactions.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,994
So the user is working on the visual task
directly, and then computer

103
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:31,961
implicitly observes the action and then
provides help and

104
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:37,770
solution, and I think this kind of walking
style can be useful.

105
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,330
One possible application is like this, so
in your

106
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,772
PowerPoint or in any presentation, you
have alignment show.

107
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:50,880
Alignment to is hidden somewhere in the
menu, and it's not easy to find.

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,850
For example, in this PowerPoint, you can
get there from some way around.

109
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:01,760
Home, and somewhere, I don't know [LAUGH]
height, alignment, and somewhere.

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,240
But it's not easy to find.

111
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,500
However, if you highlight these four
almost aligned

112
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,190
element, I think it's pretty reasonable,
and also useful

113
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,520
for the system suggest particular
alignment, in align

114
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,920
left or align center, and suggest to the
user.

115
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,970
And if the user likes it, then it just
create it, and it gets the result.

116
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,330
And this can be a very powerful help for
the user.

117
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,120
So that's it and the original paper was
published in 2001.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,670
And this work, our work is strongly
inspired

119
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,270
by a previous system called the SKETCH
system.

120
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,090
So this SKETCH system takes two
dimensional gestures and the

121
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,330
system will automatically generate this
kind of three dimensional scene.

122
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,940
So what they do is very interesting.

123
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,420
So you input this 2D and you need to infer
3D position.

124
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,700
To do it the system uses a [UNKNOWN] of
every

125
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,160
object that has to be put on top of every
object.

126
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,840
In this way, the computer computes 3D
depths and measures.

127
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,850
Showing multiple candidates for values to
choose is also presented before,

128
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,760
the presented work is called Design
Galleries and published in 1997.

129
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,640
I also recommend you to take a look at
this work.

130
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Thank you.
