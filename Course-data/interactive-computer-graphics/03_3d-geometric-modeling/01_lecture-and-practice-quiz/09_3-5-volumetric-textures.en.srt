00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,770
The last topic of this week is volumetric
textures.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,710
The work we introduce here is volumetric

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,730
illustrations, designing 3D model with
internal textures.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,880
So motivation is here.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,113
So we can see carefully designed three

6
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:22,290
dimensional illustration that shows
complicated internal structure.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,760
And this kinds illustration is very
difficult to

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,700
generate, and also, it is especially
difficult to make

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,680
it possible to interactively draw this
kind of illustration

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,820
as you cut an object, so that's a goal.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,910
The goal is to design cuttable 3D models.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,360
You have 3D geometry, and whenever you
cut, you

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,720
will get beautiful cross section, that is
the goal.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,402
And the program is very difficult to do.

15
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:55,160
Traditional, standard 3D models there is
nothing inside, if you cut it is empty.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,560
If you want internal structure, you
probably need body metric

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,060
information However, body metric
information is very difficult to generate.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,094
You, essentially you have to paint
individual pixel

19
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,455
box in x, y, g space one by one.

20
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:11,720
Especially if you want colors.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,240
It's very, too complicated.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,790
You can also use CD scanners or MRI to
scan

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,210
but they just give you intensive values
and there's no

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,791
beautiful colors assigned and that's a
problem we address and

25
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:30,400
the base guide here is to use picture
synthesis technique.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,620
So as soon as you cut the marrow,
[UNKNOWN] there is nothing inside.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,547
But in the modeling phase, the designer
specifies

28
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:43,510
which texture elements to use to generate
cross section.

29
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,500
Using this information or hint system in

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,250
the real time synthesizes the real
texture.

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,250
So from the users point of view, it looks
like there is an existing texture inside.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,220
That's the idea.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm going to show you a video.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:06,996
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,680
So here's the system overview.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,281
So you provide input image and then as
soon as a user cut a 3D model.

37
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,760
Make sure it's empty.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,940
But system synthesis cross section

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,414
automatically using texture synthesis
technique.

40
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,980
So let me fast show you the user interface
for browsing.

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,430
So here's an input solidity shape, and the
user cut the shape

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,059
and the system synthesizes the cross
section and then you get this result.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,350
And if you cut in different way, you get
different texture.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,060
So from users point of view, it looks like
it has three dimensional textures.

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,690
But from the systems point of view, it
just paints the cross section.

46
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,745
Here's a cucumber, when you cut it, you
get cross section everywhere.

47
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:13,785
So it was

48
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:18,390
browsing

49
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,970
interface and now we show the modeling
interface.

50
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,636
So the modeling starts with the given

51
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:32,920
3D surface model, nothing inside just
surface.

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,930
And the way we'll teach how to synthesize
internal texture to the system, so user

53
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,420
fast cut, example cross section, and they
cut and see the inside.

54
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,650
And they user specifies, which texture
type

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,070
you use, isotopic, orientation or layered,
or oriented.

56
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,470
Then if the user chooses layered texture,
the

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,430
system asks the user to specify example
textures.

58
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,110
Say drop image here and the user drag and
drop meat photograph.

59
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,730
And the user teaches which particles or
image to use.

60
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,150
This is the outside, this is the inside
and you'll get this.

61
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,166
And then also, user specify of there is

62
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,770
a difference in volume and inside and
outside.

63
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,994
And you teach which part of the sodium
model is inside or outside.

64
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:35,922
It is these correspondences, now the
system has enough information,

65
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:40,976
and then synthesizes the picture, using
the 3D modeling.

66
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:44,047
Now given this information, now we are
able to use our

67
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:49,041
cut in different locations, the systems
synthesizes it in the appropriate picture.

68
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:54,473
[BLANK_AUDIO]

69
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:58,650
In this system we supported three types,
three types.

70
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,551
So, first one is Isotropic, so there's an
orientation.

71
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:10,910
So, it's the easiest one, Like [UNKNOWN]
or sponge, potato and others.

72
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:18,310
You just pick a type and then log on with
a single texture, or orientation.

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,050
And then since this is automatically
starts, like this.

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,550
The

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,090
second one is layered structure, such as,
carrots, or cakes, and others.

76
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,040
And this is also a layered structure.

77
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,330
And here is a select the layer picture,
and then get an image,

78
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,640
another set as we've already seen, use the
space files inside or outside.

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,500
Or top and bottom and you also need to

80
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,745
space away the same thing for the 3D eh,
geometry.

81
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:07,383
Top and bottom.

82
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,900
And now we know the correspondence between
difference images and the 3D

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,290
geometry, and then system starts to

84
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,270
synthesize the texture of our chocolate
cake.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,790
The same thing for carrot, you can specify

86
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,990
inside, outside and the inside, outside
for 3D shape.

87
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,130
And the system synthesizes the shape,
texture.

88
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,530
The final one is oriented textures,

89
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,830
like this bamboo shape.

90
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,450
Bamboo fibers have a specific orientation.

91
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,677
So in that case user needs to specify the
orientation of fibers.

92
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:52,542
So user input is two dimensional texture
of a horizontal

93
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:57,782
cut and then you get three dimensional
volume

94
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:03,791
difference, and then user specifies the
orientation.

95
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:09,417
So here, user draws lines here and then
orientation of hair is automatically

96
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:15,144
generated, and the system synthesizes the
texture along with orientation.

97
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:20,431
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:24,337
Sorry it's a little bit difficult to see
in this presentation, but I hope

99
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:28,060
you see, for example, more lines here and
lots of dots here, and so.

100
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,570
And here is an example, modeling example,

101
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,660
so you have a three dimensional tooth
model.

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,308
First there is nothing inside,

103
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:50,300
then you pick up a photograph of the

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,153
insulation and then you put, specified

105
00:07:56,153 --> 00:08:01,145
additions and then you will get the

106
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:06,860
body metric texture for a tooth.

107
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,360
That's it.

108
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,710
And here's a couple of results, like
cucumber, or a donut, or bamboo, or tooth.

109
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,710
And, as I said, modelling phase, you use a
specified how to paste the image to

110
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,920
the 3D model from the closed section, by
specifying outside, inside, and so on.

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,530
Another way is like this.

112
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,720
So for the reference image, use a space
slice inside and outside and then you

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,450
compute the control mark, kind of
diffusion over the distance from inside.

114
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,310
And then also you get the same control map
for the cross-section.

115
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,550
For the information or notation given to
the 3-D shape.

116
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,900
And then, given this to information system
generates

117
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,620
a synthesize cross section using textures
synthesis algorithm.

118
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,240
And let me briefly describe the texture
synthesis algorithm.

119
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,730
Texture synthesis is a very popular
technique in computer graphics.

120
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,570
And it generates a larger texture from
input smaller texture.

121
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,500
And when our original paper was published
in

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,740
99, and the basic idea is very, very
simple.

123
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,780
So, for synthesising a new texture from
each individual

124
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:26,080
pixel, you just searches for the similar
context pixel in the left virus.

125
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,230
And of you find a more similar one, just
get a

126
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,520
color or the more similar pixel just to
cut into the frame.

127
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,002
So, just by repeating this many times
starting

128
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:41,017
from a [UNKNOWN] you get very, very
realistic texture.

129
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,602
And this technique is very frequently used

130
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:46,920
and recently, already used in commercial
products.

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,050
So yeah, so original paper was published

132
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,040
in 2004 as Volumetric Illustrations and
Texture

133
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,630
Synthesis, a lot of papers, but original
paper was Texture Synthesis in ICCV, '99.

134
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,524
And if you want to now the recent ones, a
famous one is PatchMatch.

135
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:14,270
Published in 2009, and this is currently
used in Photoshop, and those applications.

136
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,545
There are a couple more, recent 3D picture
in solid texture and

137
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:25,530
not solid textures .And so these may be
interesting for you.

138
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,700
Thank you.

139
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,370
Okay so this is the end of 3D Modeling.

140
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,520
We introduced suggestive interface,
sketch-based modeling, shape control by

141
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,130
curves, and volumetric textures and let me
go back to the initial discussion.

142
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,420
So the challenge in 3D modeling is how

143
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,190
to compliment missing information, mainly
depth or z bodies.

144
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,840
An approach is to user a design user

145
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,550
interface, an automatic inference
leveraging domain specific knowledge.

146
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,900
So, in the examples we show today, you
know, for

147
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,528
architecture modeling we use hard-coded
rules for design for architecture models.

148
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:11,970
And for [UNKNOWN] organic shapes, we use
the

149
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,060
inflation algorithms, elimination
[UNKNOWN] sets, so target is smooth.

150
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,972
And for all our modeling, we deduct

151
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:22,570
very specialized structure and zooming in
the editors.

152
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,960
And for cross sections, we use texture
synthesis outwards.

153
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,170
yeah, thank you.
