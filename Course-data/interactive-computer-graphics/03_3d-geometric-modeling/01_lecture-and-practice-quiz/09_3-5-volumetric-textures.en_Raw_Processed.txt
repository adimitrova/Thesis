last topic this week is volumetric 
textures 
work we introduce here is volumetric 
illustrations, designing d model 
internal textures 
so motivation is here 
so we see carefully designed three 
dimensional illustration that shows 
complicated internal structure 
this kinds illustration is 
difficult to 
generate, also, is especially 
difficult to make 
possible to interactively draw this 
kind illustration 
you cut an object, so thats a goal 
goal is to design cuttable d models 
you d geometry, whenever you 
cut, you 
will get beautiful cross section, that is 
goal 
program is difficult to 
traditional, standard d models there is 
nothing inside, if you cut is empty 
if you want internal structure, you 
probably need body metric 
information however, body metric 
information is difficult to generate 
you, essentially you to paint 
individual pixel 
box in x, y, g space one one 
especially if you want colors 
very, complicated 
you also use cd scanners mri to 
scan 
give you intensive values 
theres 
beautiful colors assigned thats a 
problem we address 
base guide here is to use picture 
synthesis technique 
so soon you cut marrow, 
unknown there is nothing inside 
in modeling phase, designer 
specifies 
texture elements to use to generate 
cross section 
using this information hint system in 
real time synthesizes real 
texture 
so users point view, looks 
like there is an existing texture inside 
thats idea 
im going to show you a video 
blankaudio 
so heres system overview 
so you provide input image 
soon a user cut a d model 
make sure empty 
system synthesis cross section 
automatically using texture synthesis 
technique 
so let fast show you user interface 
browsing 
so heres an input solidity shape, 
user cut shape 
system synthesizes cross 
section you get this result 
if you cut in different way, you get 
different texture 
so users point view, looks like 
three dimensional textures 
systems point view, 
paints cross section 
heres a cucumber, you cut it, you 
get cross section everywhere 
so 
browsing 
interface we show modeling 
interface 
so modeling starts given 
d surface model, nothing inside 
surface 
way well teach to synthesize 
internal texture to system, so user 
fast cut, example cross section, 
cut see inside 
user specifies, texture 
type 
you use, isotopic, orientation layered, 
oriented 
if user chooses layered texture, 

system asks user to specify example 
textures 
say drop image here user drag 
drop meat photograph 
user teaches particles 
image to use 
this is outside, this is inside 
youll get this 
also, user specify there is 
a difference in volume inside 
outside 
you teach part sodium 
model is inside outside 
is correspondences, 
system enough information, 
synthesizes picture, using 
d modeling 
given this information, we 
able to use 
cut in different locations, systems 
synthesizes in appropriate picture 
blankaudio 
in this system we supported three types, 
three types 
so, first one is isotropic, so theres an 
orientation 
so, easiest one, like unknown 
sponge, potato others 
you pick a type log 
a single texture, orientation 
since this is automatically 
starts, like this 

second one is layered structure, as, 
carrots, cakes, others 
this is also a layered structure 
here is a select layer picture, 
get an image, 
another set weve already seen, use 
space files inside outside 
top bottom you also need to 
space away thing d eh, 
geometry 
top bottom 
we know correspondence between 
difference images d 
geometry, system starts to 
synthesize texture chocolate 
cake 
thing carrot, you specify 
inside, outside inside, outside 
d shape 
system synthesizes shape, 
texture 
final one is oriented textures, 
like this bamboo shape 
bamboo fibers a specific orientation 
so in that case user needs to specify 
orientation fibers 
so user input is two dimensional texture 
a horizontal 
cut you get three dimensional 
volume 
difference, user specifies 
orientation 
so here, user draws lines here 
orientation hair is automatically 
generated, system synthesizes 
texture along orientation 
blankaudio 
sorry a little bit difficult to see 
in this presentation, i hope 
you see, example, lines here 
lots dots here, so 
here is an example, modeling example, 
so you a three dimensional tooth 
model 
first there is nothing inside, 
you pick a photograph 
insulation you put, specified 
additions you will get 
body metric texture a tooth 
thats 
heres a couple results, like 
cucumber, a donut, bamboo, tooth 
and, i said, modelling phase, you use a 
specified to paste image to 
d model closed section, 
specifying outside, inside, so 
another way is like this 
so reference image, use a space 
slice inside outside you 
compute control mark, kind 
diffusion distance inside 
also you get control map 
crosssection 
information notation given to 
d shape 
then, given this to information system 
generates 
a synthesize cross section using textures 
synthesis algorithm 
let briefly describe texture 
synthesis algorithm 
texture synthesis is a popular 
technique in computer graphics 
generates a larger texture 
input smaller texture 
original paper published 
in 
, basic idea is very, 
simple 
so, synthesising a new texture 
individual 
pixel, you searches similar 
context pixel in left virus 
you find a similar one, 
get a 
color similar pixel to 
cut frame 
so, repeating this many times 
starting 
a unknown you get very, 
realistic texture 
this technique is frequently used 
recently, already used in commercial 
products 
so yeah, so original paper published 
in volumetric illustrations 
texture 
synthesis, a lot papers, original 
paper texture synthesis in iccv, 
if you want to recent ones, a 
famous one is patchmatch 
published in , this is currently 
used in photoshop, applications 
there a couple more, recent d picture 
in solid texture 
solid textures so may 
interesting you 
thank you 
okay so this is end d modeling 
we introduced suggestive interface, 
sketchbased modeling, shape control 
curves, volumetric textures let 
go back to initial discussion 
so challenge in d modeling is 
to compliment missing information, mainly 
depth z bodies 
an approach is to user a design user 
interface, an automatic inference 
leveraging domain specific knowledge 
so, in examples we show today, you 
know, 
architecture modeling we use hardcoded 
rules design architecture models 
unknown organic shapes, we use 

inflation algorithms, elimination 
unknown sets, so target is smooth 
modeling, we deduct 
specialized structure zooming in 
editors 
cross sections, we use texture 
synthesis outwards 
yeah, thank you
