1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,626
And next topic is flower modeling.

2
00:00:02,626 --> 00:00:06,640
This is an example of very domain specific
modeling operations.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,290
And the work we introduce here is called
floral diagrams and inflorescences.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,450
The program we present here, discuss here
is

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,520
flower modeling, and the flower modeling
is very difficult.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,500
It has very complicated geometry.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,980
With you know, petals and [UNKNOWN], and

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,000
also, at the same time, complicated
structure.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,590
So, again, each element has complicated
shape, and also

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,140
we have a very complicated arrangement of
interior elements.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,809
So that's a program we want to address.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,270
And our approach is like this, for
complicated geometry

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,760
we use very specialized sketching
interfaces for all our elements.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,660
For hunting a complicated structure we

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,130
again, provide a very specialized
structure editor.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,450
By combing a very specialized system we
can make it very

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,070
much easier for the user to design various
kinds of flowers.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,840
Let me show you a video.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,450
So here's a program we would try to
address.

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,970
You know, this kind of flower diagram, a
flower

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,790
more that it consists of many small
elements obligated together.

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,111
And then we have complete skeleton
structure like this one, I like this one.

23
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:32,962
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:36,964
And then what we do is use a traditional
art of presentation called

25
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,313
floral diagrams, and inflorescences as an
interface

26
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:43,025
for designing our flowers in the computer.

27
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:52,161
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:57,689
So floral diagram, defines arrangements of
elements for individual flower.

29
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,928
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,986
Inflorescences defines an arrangement

31
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:16,156
or group of flowers in this model.

32
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:19,394
And you see the user interactivity
operates the diagram,

33
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,778
and then you continuously see this updated
to your directory

34
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:30,996
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:36,060
And the modeling process start with the
defining of a floral diagram.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,033
So in the flower base you arrange
individual elements,

37
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,424
and then you can see a 3-D measure preview
here.

38
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:50,898
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:52,459
So as you see, this is a

40
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,983
very specialized dedicated weathering
system for flower arrangements.

41
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:04,237
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:09,090
After our getting a diagram, now, the user
defines a geometry.

43
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,420
As you see, we provide a very, very simple
sketching interface for defining a shape.

44
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,749
But here, system will carry [UNKNOWN] off
a resolution.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,750
And for each, for our element, our

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,700
system provides a various indicated
sketching apparatus.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,954
So this is why in is initiating a pulse.

48
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:35,944
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:40,280
And then this is texture modeling, so you
draw three lines.

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,480
And then you get this after you get the
3-D model.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,990
And from the side view the user draws a
line, and you get a different shape.

52
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:55,605
So with just only four strokes, you will
get a very huge form of flower element.

53
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:59,509
And you can continuously add more and more
strokes, to get more detailed shape.

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,450
And then after having drawn a

55
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,710
diagram and 3D components, you establish
correspondences,

56
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,970
or associations, and then with some
information

57
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,700
assistance, start to generate an
aggregated composition.

58
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,090
And then you will get, beautiful shape.

59
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:30,400
Now we assemble them together into a,
structure using infrared tendencies.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,360
You get this template, and then you change
the shape, and then you label the shape.

61
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,860
And now we define axis, center axis by
sketching.

62
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,880
This is an interesting part, so you draw
two dimensional stroke to

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,660
define axis, and then system generates 3D
minimum axis that we see.

64
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,490
This is the last stroke, and then as

65
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,704
the user draw, system would generate 3D
dimensional axis.

66
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,641
And sometimes you finish drawing you can
rotate

67
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,290
and you will get the reasonable 3D shape.

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:11,290
[BLANK_AUDIO]

69
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,204
Yeah, so here's a little bit more

70
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:20,870
description about 2D input to 3D stalk
part.

71
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,830
So without depth assignment if you project
your input onto

72
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,660
a flat surface it looks unnatural, a very
flat shape.

73
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,290
However, with our algorithm.

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,170
User draws a stroke, two-dimensional
stroke, and

75
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,000
the system automatically assigns a
natural, naturally

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,690
looking depth variation, so if you look

77
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,230
from, look from a sideway, it looks
natural.

78
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,176
So to do this, what we do is assume

79
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:06,180
that three-dimensional curvature is always
constant in 3-D space.

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,470
Is this assumption we can look into the
computer depths.

81
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,400
And then her are a couple results.

82
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,910
I think it is very tedious and
time-consuming to generate

83
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,020
these types of models using traditional 3D
general purpose modeling systems.

84
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,893
But with our system, it's very, much, much
faster.

85
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:36,410
Of course, it takes certain time, but it's
much faster than using creation method.

86
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,143
And you can easily modify them.

87
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:49,046
[BLANK_AUDIO]

88
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:50,870
Yup, that's it.

89
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,650
And then, here are a couple examples.

90
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,010
These are 3D shapes and these are the
structure editors.

91
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,530
And then here let me briefly describe the
other [UNKNOWN] 2D stroke to 3D shape.

92
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,010
So as I said the basic assumption.

93
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,650
The main idea is to assume constant
curvature in 3-D space.

94
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,610
Which means second derivatives, exposition
of second derivative of

95
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,940
zed, z positions by y value, is the
constant.

96
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,020
Y is a growth direction.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,960
See here again, this is two-dimensional
input on X-Y plane.

98
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,010
Y is a growth direction, and x is sideways
vectors and

99
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,150
then we compute, we try to compute z
values in this way.

100
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,860
So you don't have passed the project
stroke onto x y plane and resample.

101
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,910
So we put the sample points here, and

102
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,410
then we suppose that 3D curvature is
constant so.

103
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,630
Second derivative of X along Y and second
derivative zero Y equal constant.

104
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,580
And we know this volume by this shape.

105
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,230
We also will assume this constant body

106
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,965
by maximum of this volume, we summarized
here.

107
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:14,078
Maximum curvature.

108
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,016
And here.

109
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:20,490
The curvature in X-Y plane gets smaller
here.

110
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,290
But instead we at, assign large value
here,

111
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,640
which means large curvature in three
directions, and here.

112
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,370
So this is given value, and this is given
value, and you get this value.

113
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,670
And after get this values secondary letter
Z, just integrate twice,

114
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,630
and then you will get the variable, so
that is the algorithm.

115
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,077
So to learn more, the original paper can
be

116
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:54,680
found in SIGGRAPH 2005 titled Floral
Diagrams and Inflorescences.

117
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,982
Interacting from our modeling using our
botanical structure research.

118
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:02,372
Now, interactive modeling has a long
history of

119
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:05,431
research, and one famous book is called
The

120
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,234
Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, and this one
discusses

121
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:14,290
some really interesting techniques using
model based systems.

122
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,330
So here is a, one, example, you draw this
kind of synthesis, and you

123
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,522
will get this kind of very complicated

124
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:24,170
structure, and this is very beautiful
mathematical system.

125
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,650
However, it is a little bit unintuitive
for our artists to design more of them.

126
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,910
So this, this entry people use this kind
of

127
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,590
graphical rule editor to generate a 3D
shape like this.

128
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,560
And this, and this paper about the

129
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,088
paper titled, Modeling Methods and User
Interface for Creating Plants, was

130
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:52,630
currently available as a modeling system
called XFrog.

131
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,420
This is a very popular tool.

132
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,840
If you are interested in this modeling I
suggest you take a look at these systems
