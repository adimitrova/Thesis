next topic is shape control curves 
we introduce here is called 
fibermesh 
we propose is an extension 
previous technique, called 
sketch d modeling 
difference is that original sketch 
stays works a handle 
so here, input is similar 
you draw something you get d shape 
however, unlike previous system, this 
curve stays surface, you 
graph move around 
form shape 
let show you a demo 
so again, input is similar 
heres a draw a line, system 
inflates 
however, you see, input stroke 
stays there this serves a handle 
so you grab them, move upwards 
then, soft continuously changes 
you see top, you 
pull sideways to see shape 
in this way, you get control, 
you get 
smooth shapes, possible 
in polygon based system 
you also add contour curves 
in this way 
you grab this thing, to 
change shape 
like previously you also 
add an arm 
sideways, you pull 
to change shape 
here, you see, we two kinds 
curves 
blue curves is a kind smooth 
constraint, 
red curve is, you see, a sharp 
constraint 
course, you change 
categories 
example, if you change to a blue, 
you know, you see 
you will get a smooth rendition and, if 
you 
want you also erase to remove 
constraint 
you will get a smooth shape 
an example is here 
you draw a shape here, 
you draw a shape here 
here this is to literally to motion 
if you want, you make sharp, 
youre going to get this kind 
shape 
right 
let show you a couple examples 
here you get this shape, you cut 
here like this way 
you get shops, shapes 
if you erase parts, 
you get shape 
so here, you know, smooth shape, 
discontinuity 
here, so this part is going around 
again, you meet a sharp 
crease 
this is easy to compared to 
approaches 
you use inaudible always 
smooth, if you use this 
continuous boundaries this is 
easy 
combining operations, you 

get good shapes like 

you make this kind mask a human 
body 
arms so 
point here is that, traditional 
methods require user to design 
is models manipulating individual 
control body, 
here i use a control a curves 
we hope that this is a 
intuitive efficient 
let describe algorithm behind 
scene 
so basic idea behind is a user controls 
a curve 
curves define boundary, 

system automatically generates smooth 
surface based 
curves running a continuous 
optimization, trying to 
make a smooth surface defined 
curves 
so thats basic idea 
let describe details 
so curve deformation takes handle position 

input, generates curve geometry, 
updated curve geometry 
surface optimization takes curve 
geometry 
input, generates a smooth 
surface 
let describe curve deformation 
first 
so curve deformation works like this way 
so you this shape 
input save, segment 
three dimensional coordinate frames 
then, if you pull one point upwards, 
an assistant will define entire 
curve 
then, you pull upwards, coordinate 
frames also rotate together 
we is simultaneously updates 
position, rings, also 
quotation coordinate frame individual 
segments, curve segments 
this is a quick overview 
please refer to paper details 
minimize functional, right, moving 
around quadrics positions digital 
rotations 
so we try to find good smooth 
quadric position edgy digital 
rotations minimize this 
we minimizes here, is that 
difference 
so this is 
this is a small laplacian means, 
difference observed current position 
surrounding position, 
current difference is rotated 

is compared to current updated 
laplacian 
this preserves local details 
this one tries to minimize 
difference between neighboring rotations 
so this tries to achieve smoother 
rotations 
this one is tries to minimize 
difference between current position 
position this line positions, 
nearby positions 
so, one is a smooth position 
this, try to minimize difference 
between original position updated 
position 
similarly, this one tries to minimize 
previous current rotation updated 
rotation 
so solving this system, system tries to 
find a smooth deformation 
next one is surface optimization 
surface optimization takes input a 
curve geometry a mesh topology 
this is input 
system will automatically 
generate smooth surface 
to so system basically tries to 
minimize variation curvature 
you know, curvature is curved 
surface is 
minimizing variation 
curvature, system tries to generate a 
smooth surface 
in a mathematical representation, looks 
like this 
so, kn is a curvature, kn 
derivative 
in inaudible axis second axis, 
this represents 
curvature, curvature variations, 
we try to minimize this 

fortunately this is linear program 
easy to, efficient to compute 
so we approximate this couple stepwise 
linear computations like this 
a little bit complicated, luckily we 
two parts 
two passes 
so one is cover up, so left flow computes 
curvatures 
so we first computer curvatures is a 
scale values, 
blending smoothing we 
get target curvatures 
so you see, originally curvature 
many variations 
smoothing out, you get a 
uniform target curvature values 
so we tried to obtain curvature 
values 
curvature values, 
multiplied a 
surface normal, you get target laplacian 
vertices, vectors 
so we try to obtain this lapracian 
vectors 
in parallel, we also compute edge lengths 
so free us to compute current edge 
lengths 
we compute target edge lengths, 
blending smoothing 
then, multiply this target edge 
lengths 
current edge vectors, you get target edge 
vectors 
combining target laplacian 
vectors target edge 
vectors, we solve earliest square problem 
you updated geometry 
way you repeat multiple times, 
you get optimized smooth shape 
so original paper called fibermesh 
designing freeform surfaces d 
curves 
similar technique that hes trying to 
gradually changing safe considering 
local details originally a 
presented sketched based interface 
detailpreserving mesh editing 
also technique is kind also 
learning surface fairing continuously 
inspired work geometric 
fairing 
irregular meshes three, 
freefrom surface design 
we recommend to take a look 
works
