okay, next topic is sketchbased 
modeling 
work we introduce here is called 
teddy 
problem we want to address here is 
that d 
modeling is difficult, especially modeling 
motion d organic shape is difficult 
so a typical user interface is like this 
so typically, you three views 
you view, front view, 
left view you 
put many body sees you put many edges 
create many faces 
you to combine many, many 
commands 
nest many many 
parameters 
this useful an idea a 
professional production movies tv 
shows, cars products 
however, if you want to use this kind 
system communication this is way 
difficult to to 
however hand, if you a 
pen a paper you quickly draw 
something, something 
meaningful importantly if you 
look this kind 
image you infer geometric 
information example 
probably, this face is, you know, kind 
lozengeshaped, also 
hands a bit larger head 
something like that 
you get general idea 
so idea is to implement this kind 
visual 
intelligence a computer to make a 
useful d modeling tool 
so thats idea 
let show you a demo 
so you get brown canvas you 
pick 
a pen, you try draw a line this 
canvas 
here you draw something here 
soon you finished drawing 
system mathematical inflated, you 
get this d shape, so 
now, this is already d, so you see 
front 
top, you also rotate it, 
so you get 
a full d shape here, you also cut 
this object 
you also paint cut you 
also add a bump, so in this way you 
generate reasonable d object 
drawing outline 
intended shape internally this is 
standard d object presentation 
so if you use traditional tools, you 
to combine many commands 
also you to manipulate many 
visual elements, tedious 
let describe some, little bit 
individual operations 
first operation is creations 
blank canvas, you draw closed 
region 
this is inflated 
so if you draw circle you get a 
sphere 
if you get long bar you get bar 
you generate this kind 
snake shape 
so, in words, is basically 
like this 
so if you a large region system 
increase a lot 
if you get a narrower region, to sustain 
a little 
in this way, you get always get a cross 
section 
looks almost half, half a cross 
section 
so thats idea, let turn 
sound 
so this is powerful 
so, example, you gt this kind 
shape you also get this kind 
shape 
so again, input is simple two 
strong 
in this image there is reasonable 
shape two d sketch 
d geometry, you 
interact 
first, you paint 
stroke is projected onto d 
surface 
you also erase past 
scribbling 
then, if input is inside 
object will projected painted 
however, if you sort comes outside 
inside 
side, will cut object by, you know, 
projecting line 
this useful intersection 
that i in 
this shape you make a mouth like 
this way 
so thats a cut operation 
next operation is extrusion 
bump operation 
so if you want to add a bump 
you a closed region, rotate, 
a second stroke 
so this is two, two stroke operations 
first stroke defines a domain, 
second operation stroke defines a 
silhouette 
so, this is basically a sweep extrude 
operation 
so this imput first throw, second 
throw, you will get this 
this is flexible 
example, if you draw this kind shape 
you get a snowman kind 
shape you also make a mushroom 
kind shape this way 
if you draw outside, will generate 
a bump 
you also draw inside, you will 
get cavity you get a structure 
this way 
another example is a plate like 
shape 
so, if you draw this domain, if you 
draw this shape you get a in a wing shape 
again, you will draw this shape, 
this shape youll get wing 
see 
this way, you generate, kind a 
bird 
objects, you may 
want to deform edit 
in order to so, we also provide 
sketchbased operations 
so called this bend button 
so this take two strokes 
first one is a left hand stroke 
second one is target stroke 
so lets a left hand stroke, 
a target stroke 
so system tries to to form a shape 
so that lead deforms groove 
you will get this result 
so, in this way you get reasonable 
solid 
shape sketching, this deformation 
to a loose form 
so press bending left is input, 
defines moves target 
you will get this, this kind 
shape 
you also refine output 
unknown 
so combining operation you 
get a shape something like this 
blankaudio 
let show you a couple d models 
painted results 
blankaudio 
so, models created using 
this 
technique theyre painted using 
traditional, painting interfaces 
you see one generate a 
reasonable d object using this technique 
blankaudio 
so let describe algorithm a little 
bit 
so heres a overview algorithm 
unknown 
so this is twodimensional user input 
last thing computer is 
fast 
identify an axis skeleton that 
discloses domain 
so, center line 
computing, this center line, 
axis, 
we lift it, we raise them, in this way 
an important point here is that amount 
lifting 
depends proportional, to distance 
to silhouette 
example, here, distance is 
large, so gets higher 
however, here, distance is short, 
so to get higher 
so, in this way, you get visible shape 
that, remaining task is 
simple 
we put an overall shape along 
axis silhouette to get final 
result 
so this is overview 
let describe stepbystep 
so input is twodimensional, polygon 
polyline 
then, that, we apply, 
constrained delaunay triangulation 
this is simple computation general 
to operations, triangulate 
that we compute an axis 
connecting midpoints 
well this is, again, simple 
operation, 
powerful tool analyzing 
shape 
this one, this technique is published 
could use a person in 
connecting midpoints, you 
get, three kinds triangles 
one is this, conjunction triangles, 
external edges 
another is sleeve triangles, one 
external edges 
also, terminal triangles, two 
external edges 
this, next topic is 
trimming 
so trimming trimming 
so in order to in flight lift central 
axis we to remove dl edges like this 
one 
now, let describe to this 
trimming operations 
so trimming starts end 
axis remove one one 
so works like this, so if you get this 
situation starting terminal, 
we pick terminal edge draw a circle, 
half circle 
if edges, peaks inside 
hemicircle, you go inwards, like this 
again, a hemicircle, half circle, 
check everything is inside 
if everything is inside, go farther 
now, if vertices are, vertices 
outside circle, 
we stop trimming operation, 
you will get, 
this terminal triangles 
so thats a trimming operation 
previous operation, you get 
this idea shape 
this is we stand 
you get center shape 
you lift center axis 
proportional to distance here 
so, if you look here, you serrated 
line center line 
you lift in this way, 
this length is a bridge surrounding 
edges 
that, you put quarter a 
circle in 
this way in this way 
stitch 
together 
application this system is 
enhancing communications 
you know this technique is good 
production movies tv shows so 

car design 
this technique is used face 
to 
face communication somebody in front 
white board 
let show you a couple examples 
so one possible application is education 
example, in a biology class, 
teacher may say this is a bacteria 
internal select shows like 
this 
students understand kind 
threedimensional concept 
theres possible application 
in medical applications 
example, doctor may want to say, this 
is stomach 
there you a serious problem here 
doctor say, you know, lets 
fix it, so 
a dentist may say this tooth, 
that there you a serious 
problem here there, that you need 
to remove them, so 
one particular interesting application 
we want to show is teaching geography 
you know, geography is concept 
mountains valleys 
rivers lot three dimensional 
ideas, 
difficult to understand sometimes 
using two dimensional whiteboard, here 
if you a d sketching 
useful 
an example we want to use a teaching 
contour lines 
in you may know contour lines, you 
know, in 
two dimensional map, you see lots 
lines indicating heights 
difficult to understand 
that means 
well here, teacher say, now, you 
mountain 
here, mountain side view, front view, 
top view 
so you one mountain here 
now, let draw lines indicating 
equal height, 
say this is ten meter high, meters, 
meters, meters 
so lines indicate equal height 
this is side view front 
view 
if you look, then, top, 
you see that this is a contour line 
there you allow many things, like 
sparse contour lines indicates, you 
know, gentle slope, dense contour 
lines indicate sharp slope, so 
so, yeah 
so this is a main application we 
thinking this kind sketchbased 
modeling 
okay, so to learn more, first i recommend 
you to look original paper 
describes detail algorithm 
creation also extrusion 
cutting 
technique we use is a chordal 
axis 
called morphological analysis 
shapes 
this is useful to shapes 
we introduced polygons mesh based 
information, 
another possible approach is using 
implicit surfaces 
so masters generates smooth shapes 
like this one so generates smooth 
connection 
these, i also change 
configuration later 
this one is called shapeshop 
published in 
i think application is also available 
so i recommend you to try them, 
thank you
