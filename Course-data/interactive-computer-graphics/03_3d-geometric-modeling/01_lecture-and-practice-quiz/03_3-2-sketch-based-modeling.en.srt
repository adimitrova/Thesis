1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay, our next topic is sketch-based
modeling.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,170
And the work we introduce here is called
Teddy.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,350
And the problem we want to address here is
that 3D

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,620
modeling is difficult, especially modeling
of motion 3D organic shape is difficult.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,260
So a typical user interface is like this.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,740
So typically, you have three views.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,990
And then you have above view, front view,
left view and then you

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,550
put many body sees and you put many edges
and create many faces.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,170
And then you have to combine many, many
commands.

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,490
And nest with many and those are many
parameters.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,980
And this can be very useful an idea for a

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,860
professional production for movies or t.v
shows, cars and products.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,900
However, if you want to use this kind of

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,210
system for communication this is way too
difficult to to.

15
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,290
However on the other hand, if you have a

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,010
pen and a paper you can quickly draw
something, something

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,920
meaningful and more importantly if you
look at this kind

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,450
of image you can infer some geometric
information for example.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,910
Probably, this face is, you know, kind of
lozenge-shaped, then also

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,750
hands should not be a bit larger head or
something like that.

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,480
You can get general idea.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,900
So our idea is to implement this kind of
visual

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,770
intelligence into a computer to make a
useful 3D modeling tool.

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,590
So that's the idea.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,500
And let me show you a demo.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,780
So again you get the brown canvas and you
pick up

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,630
a pen, and you try and draw a line on this
canvas.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,880
And then here you draw something here.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,275
And then as soon as you finished drawing.

30
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:51,900
System mathematical inflated, and then you
get this 3D shape, so

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,650
now, this is already 3D, so you can see it
from front

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,480
or top, or you can also rotate through it,
so you get

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,120
a full 3D shape here, and you can also cut
this object.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:14,110
You can also paint it and cut it and you
can also add a bump, so in this way you

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,170
can generate reasonable 3D object just by
drawing outline of the

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,100
intended shape and internally this is
standard 3D object presentation.

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,610
So if you use traditional tools, you have
to combine many commands

38
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,780
and also you have to manipulate many
visual elements, can be very tedious.

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,800
And let me describe some, little bit
individual operations.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,100
First operation is creations.

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,210
From the blank canvas, you draw closed
region.

42
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,658
And this is the inflated.

43
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,350
So if you draw circle and you get a
sphere.

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,900
And if you get long bar or you get bar

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,848
or it's you can generate this kind of
snake shape.

46
00:02:55,848 --> 00:03:01,740
And so, in other words, it is basically
like this.

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,030
So if you have a large region system
increase a lot and

48
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,960
if you get a narrower region, to sustain
for it a little.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,700
In this way, you get always get a cross
section.

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,630
Looks almost half, half of a cross
section.

51
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,880
So that's the idea, and let me turn off
the sound.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,030
And so this is very powerful.

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,450
So, for example, you can gt this kind of

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,980
shape or you can also get this kind of
shape.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,339
So again, input is just simple two be
strong.

56
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:45,010
In this image there is some reasonable
shape from two d sketch.

57
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,690
And after having 3D geometry, you can
interact with it.

58
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,460
First, you can paint on it.

59
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,180
Your stroke is projected onto the 3D
surface.

60
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,159
And you can also erase the past
scribbling.

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,940
And then, if your input is inside of the
object it will be projected and painted.

62
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,686
However, if you sort of comes outside on
the inside on the

63
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:17,910
side, it will cut the object by, you know,
projecting the line.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,410
And then this useful for our intersection
that I did in

65
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,740
this shape or you can make a mouth like
this way.

66
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,100
So that's a cut operation.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,750
And the next operation is extrusion or
bump operation.

68
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,750
So if you want to add a bump.

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,340
And you do a closed region, and rotate,
and then do a second stroke.

70
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,450
So this is two, two stroke operations.

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,130
First stroke defines a domain, and

72
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,760
the second operation stroke defines a
silhouette.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,920
So, this is basically a sweep or extrude
operation.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,280
So this the imput it's first throw, second
throw, and you will get this.

75
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,010
And this is very flexible.

76
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,670
Example, if you draw this kind of shape
you get a snowman kind

77
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,540
of shape and you can also make a mushroom
kind of shape this way.

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,870
And if you draw outside, it will generate
a bump.

79
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,990
But you can also draw inside, and you will

80
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,840
get cavity and you can get a structure
this way.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,410
Another example is a same plate like
shape.

82
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,500
So, if you draw this domain, and if you
draw this shape you get a in a wing shape.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,950
And again, you will draw this shape, and
then this shape and you'll get the wing.

84
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,100
See?

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,790
This way, you can generate, kind of a
bird.

86
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,200
And after having some objects, you may
want to deform or edit it.

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,930
In order to do so, we also provide
sketch-based operations.

88
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,210
So it's called this bend button.

89
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,940
So this take two strokes.

90
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,410
First one is a left hand stroke.

91
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,790
The second one is target stroke.

92
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,080
So let's do a left hand stroke, and then
do a target stroke.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,500
So what system tries to do to form a shape
so that lead deforms into groove.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,690
And you will get this result.

95
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,371
So, in this way you can get reasonable
solid

96
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:22,840
shape by sketching, and this deformation
to a loose form.

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:31,330
So again press bending and left is input,
defines and then moves target.

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,240
And then you will get this, this kind of
shape.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,610
And you can also refine some of the output
[UNKNOWN].

100
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,936
So by combining these operation you can
get a shape something like this.

101
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:49,941
[BLANK_AUDIO]

102
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,856
Let me show you a couple of 3D models'
painted results.

103
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:59,338
[BLANK_AUDIO]

104
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,564
So, all these models are created using
this

105
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:06,690
technique and they're painted using
traditional, painting interfaces.

106
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,713
And you can see one can generate a
reasonable 3D object using this technique.

107
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:20,836
[BLANK_AUDIO]

108
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:24,720
So let me describe its algorithm a little
bit.

109
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,027
So here's a overview of its algorithm or
[UNKNOWN].

110
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:31,760
So this is two-dimensional user input.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,600
And then last thing the computer do is
fast.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,650
Identify an axis of skeleton that
discloses the domain.

113
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,110
So, center line.

114
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,090
On the after computing, this center line,
your axis,

115
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,750
we lift it, we raise them, in this way.

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,400
An important point here is that the amount
of lifting.

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,240
Depends on proportional, to the distance
to the silhouette.

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,960
For example, here, the distance is very
large, so it gets higher.

119
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,530
However, here, the distance is very short,
so it's not to get higher.

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,410
So, in this way, you get visible shape

121
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,430
and after that, the remaining task is just
simple.

122
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,770
We just put an overall shape along the

123
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,330
axis and the silhouette to get final
result.

124
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,370
So this is overview.

125
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,460
Now let me describe step-by-step.

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,180
So input is two-dimensional, polygon or
polyline.

127
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,850
And then, after that, we apply,
constrained Delaunay triangulation.

128
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,180
This is very simple computation or general
to the operations, just triangulate them.

129
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,800
And then after that we compute an axis by
connecting mid-points.

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,690
Well this is, again, very simple
operation,

131
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,160
but very powerful tool for analyzing the
shape.

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,320
And this one, this technique is published
could use by a person in 97.

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,040
And after connecting the mid-points, you
get, three kinds of triangles.

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,660
One is this, conjunction triangles, with
no external edges.

135
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,140
And another is sleeve triangles, with one
external edges.

136
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,780
And also, terminal triangles, with two
external edges.

137
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,870
And having this, the next topic is
trimming.

138
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,240
So before trimming and after trimming.

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,080
So in order to in flight or lift central

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,050
axis we have to remove 3DL edges like this
one.

141
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,430
Now, let me describe how to do this
trimming operations.

142
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,580
So trimming starts from the end of the
axis and remove it one by one.

143
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,860
So it works like this, so if you get this
situation starting from each terminal,

144
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,580
we pick terminal edge and draw a circle,
half circle.

145
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,290
And if all edges, all peaks are inside of
the hemicircle, you go inwards, like this.

146
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,840
And again, do a hemicircle, half circle,
and check everything is inside.

147
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,070
If everything is inside, go farther.

148
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,330
And now, if vertices are, some vertices
outside of circle,

149
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,190
then we stop the trimming operation, and
then you will get,

150
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,350
this terminal triangles.

151
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,560
So that's a trimming operation.

152
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,750
And after our previous operation, you get
this idea or shape.

153
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,060
And this is where we stand.

154
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,940
After you get the center shape.

155
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,450
You just lift up the center axis
proportional to the distance here.

156
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,430
So, if you look up here, you have serrated
line and center line.

157
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,340
And you lift it up in this way, and

158
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,350
this length is a bridge of the surrounding
edges.

159
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,527
And after that, you just put quarter of a
circle in

160
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:58,590
this way and in this way and then just
stitch them

161
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,690
together.

162
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,820
And the application of this system is for
enhancing communications.

163
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,890
You know this technique is not good for

164
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,040
production of movies or TV shows and so
on.

165
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,750
Or car design.

166
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,100
But this technique is very used for face
to

167
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,740
face communication with somebody in front
of white board.

168
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,199
Let me show you a couple of examples.

169
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,710
So one possible application is education.

170
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:35,060
For example, in a biology class, the
teacher may say this is a bacteria.

171
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,830
And then internal select shows it like
this.

172
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,820
And the students can understand the kind
of three-dimensional concept.

173
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,220
And then there's the possible application
in medical applications.

174
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,990
For example, doctor may want to say, this
is your stomach.

175
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,750
And there you have a serious problem here.

176
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,645
And then doctor can say, you know, let's
fix it, and so on.

177
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:06,816
And or a dentist may say this your tooth,
and that there you have a serious

178
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:12,700
problem here and there, and that you need
to remove them, and so on.

179
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,110
And one particular interesting application
we want to show is teaching of geography.

180
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,930
You know, geography is the concept of
mountains and valleys

181
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,380
and rivers or lot of three dimensional
ideas, which can be

182
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,940
very difficult to understand sometimes
using two dimensional whiteboard, but here

183
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,300
if you have a 3D sketching it can be very
useful.

184
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,010
As an example we want to use a teaching of
contour lines.

185
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,060
As in you may know it's contour lines, you
know, in

186
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,340
the two dimensional map, you see lots of
lines indicating heights.

187
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,660
But it can be difficult to understand what
that means.

188
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,000
Well here, the teacher can say, now, you
have some mountain

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,710
here, some mountain side view, front view,
and top view.

190
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,530
So you have one mountain here.

191
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:07,100
And now, let me draw lines indicating
equal height,

192
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,960
say this is ten meter high, 20 meters, 30
meters, 40 meters.

193
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,940
So these lines indicate equal height.

194
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,290
And then this is side view and the front
view.

195
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,780
And if you look, then, from the top, now
you see that this is a contour line.

196
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,980
And there you can allow many things, like
sparse contour lines indicates, you

197
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,710
know, gentle slope, and dense contour
lines indicate sharp slope, and so.

198
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,830
So, yeah.

199
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,550
So this is a main application we

200
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,600
are thinking of this kind of sketch-based
modeling.

201
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,530
Okay, so to learn more, first I recommend
you to look at the original paper.

202
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,890
It describes the detail of the algorithm.

203
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,670
Not only creation but also extrusion and
cutting.

204
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,070
And the technique we use is a chordal
axis.

205
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,210
And it was called morphological analysis
of shapes.

206
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,590
And this is very useful to for shapes.

207
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,330
And we introduced polygons mesh based
information,

208
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,140
another possible approach is using
implicit surfaces.

209
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,800
So it masters and generates smooth shapes

210
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,380
like this one so it generates smooth
connection.

211
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,110
On these, I can also change the
configuration later.

212
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,760
And this one is called ShapeShop and
published in 2005.

213
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,320
And I think application is also available.

214
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,251
So I recommend you to try them, too.

215
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,459
Thank you.
