next topic is flower modeling 
this is an example domain specific 
modeling operations 
work we introduce here is called 
floral diagrams inflorescences 
program we present here, discuss here 
is 
flower modeling, flower modeling 
is difficult 
complicated geometry 
you know, petals unknown, 
also, time, complicated 
structure 
so, again, element complicated 
shape, also 
we a complicated arrangement 
interior elements 
so thats a program we want to address 
approach is like this, 
complicated geometry 
we use specialized sketching 
interfaces elements 
hunting a complicated structure we 
again, provide a specialized 
structure editor 
combing a specialized system we 
make 
much easier user to design various 
kinds flowers 
let show you a video 
so heres a program we would try to 
address 
you know, this kind flower diagram, a 
flower 
that consists many small 
elements obligated together 
we complete skeleton 
structure like this one, i like this one 
blankaudio 
we is use a traditional 
art presentation called 
floral diagrams, inflorescences an 
interface 
designing flowers in computer 
blankaudio 
so floral diagram, defines arrangements 
elements individual flower 
blankaudio 
inflorescences defines an arrangement 
group flowers in this model 
you see user interactivity 
operates diagram, 
you continuously see this updated 
to directory 
blankaudio 
modeling process start 
defining a floral diagram 
so in flower base you arrange 
individual elements, 
you see a d measure preview 
here 
blankaudio 
so you see, this is a 
specialized dedicated weathering 
system flower arrangements 
blankaudio 
getting a diagram, now, user 
defines a geometry 
you see, we provide a very, simple 
sketching interface defining a shape 
here, system will carry unknown 
a resolution 
each, element, 
system provides a various indicated 
sketching apparatus 
so this is in is initiating a pulse 
blankaudio 
this is texture modeling, so you 
draw three lines 
you get this you get 
d model 
side view user draws a 
line, you get a different shape 
so four strokes, you will 
get a huge form flower element 
you continuously add 
strokes, to get detailed shape 
drawn a 
diagram d components, you establish 
correspondences, 
associations, 
information 
assistance, start to generate an 
aggregated composition 
you will get, beautiful shape 
we assemble together a, 
structure using infrared tendencies 
you get this template, you change 
shape, you label shape 
we define axis, center axis 
sketching 
this is an interesting part, so you draw 
two dimensional stroke to 
define axis, system generates d 
minimum axis that we see 
this is last stroke, 
user draw, system would generate d 
dimensional axis 
sometimes you finish drawing you 
rotate 
you will get reasonable d shape 
blankaudio 
yeah, so heres a little bit 
description d input to d stalk 
part 
so without depth assignment if you project 
input onto 
a flat surface looks unnatural, a 
flat shape 
however, algorithm 
user draws a stroke, twodimensional 
stroke, 
system automatically assigns a 
natural, naturally 
looking depth variation, so if you look 
from, look a sideway, looks 
natural 
so to this, we is assume 
that threedimensional curvature is always 
constant in d space 
is this assumption we look 
computer depths 
a couple results 
i think is tedious 
timeconsuming to generate 
types models using traditional d 
general purpose modeling systems 
system, very, much, much 
faster 
course, takes certain time, 
much faster using creation method 
you easily modify 
blankaudio 
yup, thats 
then, here a couple examples 
d shapes 
structure editors 
here let briefly describe 
unknown d stroke to d shape 
so i said basic assumption 
main idea is to assume constant 
curvature in d space 
means second derivatives, exposition 
second derivative 
zed, z positions y value, is 
constant 
y is a growth direction 
see here again, this is twodimensional 
input xy plane 
y is a growth direction, x is sideways 
vectors 
we compute, we try to compute z 
values in this way 
so you dont passed project 
stroke onto x y plane resample 
so we put sample points here, 
we suppose that d curvature is 
constant so 
second derivative x along y second 
derivative zero y equal constant 
we know this volume this shape 
we also will assume this constant body 
maximum this volume, we summarized 
here 
maximum curvature 
here 
curvature in xy plane gets smaller 
here 
instead we at, assign large value 
here, 
means large curvature in three 
directions, here 
so this is given value, this is given 
value, you get this value 
get this values secondary letter 
z, integrate twice, 
you will get variable, so 
that is algorithm 
so to learn more, original paper 

found in siggraph titled floral 
diagrams inflorescences 
interacting modeling using 
botanical structure research 
now, interactive modeling a long 
history 
research, one famous book is called 

algorithmic beauty plants, this one 
discusses 
really interesting techniques using 
model based systems 
so here is a, one, example, you draw this 
kind synthesis, you 
will get this kind complicated 
structure, this is beautiful 
mathematical system 
however, is a little bit unintuitive 
artists to design 
so this, this entry people use this kind 

graphical rule editor to generate a d 
shape like this 
this, this paper 
paper titled, modeling methods user 
interface creating plants, 
currently available a modeling system 
called xfrog 
this is a popular tool 
if you interested in this modeling i 
suggest you take a look systems
