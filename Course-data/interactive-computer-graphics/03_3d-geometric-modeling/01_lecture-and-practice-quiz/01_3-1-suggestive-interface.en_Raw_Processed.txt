sound hi, this is interactive 
computer graphics, week three 
topic we discuss here is d geometric 
modeling 
so challenge behind this is user 
interface is still mostly twodimensional 
so, question is to compliment in 
missing information 
so, mainly depths here 
so use unknown d to get d 
d 
theres lots problem progress 
here 
solution, in general, is a user 
interface, an automatic inference 
leveraging domain specific knowledge 
so if you know you do, 
almost impossible to infer dips, if 
you know you want to do, if you 
limit domain you get 
reasonable results 
thats basic idea behind works i 
will introduce here 
here topics that we will 
discuss in this week 
so first one is suggestive user interface 
modeling architectural models 
theres sketchbased modeling 
larger stuffed things 
we discuss shape control 
curves, 
flower modeling, 
volumetric texture synthesis 
first one is suggestive interface 
so, work published chateau, a 
suggestive interface d modeling 
motivation is here 
so current graphical user interface is 
dominated 
many buttons, menus, even more, 
nested menus 
hard to find design command 
unknown 
unknown 

operation 
you want to main screen, 
main field 
so if we working d modeling 
if you want to related to three 
elements in scene you 
highlight 
three, hints computer to infer 
request 
computer looks hints, 
provides proposal, data 
operations 
in this case, system proposes a box, 
two possibilities 
so, in words, review first given 
arguments 
command, system 
automatically infer command 
so let show you a demo 
so here is a threedimensional modeling 
system a d 
space inside, you sketch 
lines in this way 
here, instead using many commands 
menu 
we simply allow user to highlight 
lines 
then, highlights hints, 
system pro, pro presents suggestions 
well, is drawing a plane another 
is 
drawing triangle, is drawing a 
left angle 
you also ignore 
create 
given insweep unknown 
lines, system 
predicts, suggests to make a rectangle, 
a box 
then, again, if you a line here, 
given this hint, system suggests to 
cut a box 
you also go back add 
lines 
given this hint, system suggests 
to cut a corner 
so in this way, user provides hints 
to system system presents 
suggestions 
so, this way, user really quiet 
space unknown one, in 
huge command unknown, you 
forecast visual content task 
if you highlight this, system 
predicts, suggests 
drawing plane, user draws 
example rectangle, triangle here 
if you highlight three, system 
suggests to make a face inside 
if you highlight one more, 
system suggests extrusion 
one interesting operation is like this 
one 
if you highlight two also one 
line here, a third 
this is, exactly dividing to 
three 
we use also line somewhere here, 
this is unknown divided four 
so in this way a user generate 
this kind diagram by, computing 
operations 
blankaudio 
time operations, you 
get kinds results 
this kind operation is useful 

repetitions, also symmetric 
structures so 
now, let describe, briefly describe, 
implementation behind the, system 
so, this is input scene 
so highlighted elements 
highlighted elements 
so, taking this example input scene 
system is equipped multiple 
suggestion engines, 
kind parallel engines working 
independently 
engine consists two 
parts 
one is examination part one is 
generator 
examiner examines scene, 

tests whether scene matches 
expected rule 
if passes examination, 
generator generates resulting 
scene 
so this is a hardcoded program, 
program module provided programmer 
works in parallel 
specific engine act 
specific input configuration 
heres list suggestion engines 
we input method in this application 
one is unknown given a hint 
system generator unknown passing 
hint 
also if you highlight closed roof, 
suggest polygon, perpendicular two lines 
suggest rectangle, unknown suggest a 
box, 
system suggest extrusion pyramid 
shape 
resizing bridges, 
connecting two, 
two polygons extrusion this is 
a cutting 
also corner cutting trimming 
intersection, 
duplication, repetition, mirror image 
so 
philosophy concept is defined 
this 
standard user interface is like this 
so user provides explicit command 
explicit instruction to 
computer 
computer blindly, simply 
follows instruction 
however, we provide is friendly, 
human to human like interactions 
so user is working visual task 
directly, computer 
implicitly observes action 
provides help 
solution, i think this kind walking 
style useful 
one possible application is like this, so 
in 
powerpoint in presentation, you 
alignment show 
alignment to is hidden somewhere in 
menu, easy to find 
example, in this powerpoint, you 
get there way around 
home, somewhere, i dont know laugh 
height, alignment, somewhere 
easy to find 
however, if you highlight four 
almost aligned 
element, i think pretty reasonable, 
also useful 
system suggest particular 
alignment, in align 
left align center, suggest to 
user 
if user likes it, 
create it, gets result 
this a powerful help 
user 
so thats original paper 
published in 
this work, work is strongly 
inspired 
a previous system called sketch 
system 
so this sketch system takes two 
dimensional gestures 
system will automatically generate this 
kind three dimensional scene 
so is interesting 
so you input this d you need to infer 
d position 
to system uses a unknown 
every 
object that to put top every 
object 
in this way, computer computes d 
depths measures 
showing multiple candidates values to 
choose is also presented before, 
presented work is called design 
galleries published in 
i also recommend you to take a look 
this work 
thank you
