last topic this week is, fur display 
work we present here is titled, 
graffiti fur, 
turning carpet computer display 
so, in special reason here, 
if you a carpet 
fur, using finger you trace a line 
so, this is inspiration 
we take this 
phenomenon display device 
so let show you a video 
oh yeah, here is inspiration 
you trace a line in a fur 
finger, you quickly erase 
we developed 
a computational devices to this 
so, is a roller type device 
so this one consist lots 
servomotors, moving, 
driving rod, to raise fur 
so, roller device roll along 
surface, rotates 
rotary encoder takes a rotation, 
moves pins 
so if rods pins down, 
raise inaudible 
so you drag moves down, 
leaves a pattern 
you create a pattern 
using pixel painting 
combines photograph 
others 
so, 
in order to paint multiple nodes, 
we provide a mark, tick mark here so 
you easily align multiple 
traces using this tick mark 
here is an example drawing 
a large pattern, large carpet 
so, user prepares 
a bitmap image hand, 
data to like 
this handheld device 
so this is an interesting example 
cooperative fabrication, 
cooperative action human 
robot system 
so user is also something 
also robot also something 
together user 
another device we developed 
is pen type device 
so, this is a continuously rotating wheel 
this wheel, rubber, 
rubber wheel raises fur 
important thing is that, you, 
you using finger, you draw 
a line in one direction, you cannot 
draw a line in opposite direction 
so this inconvenient, inconvenient 
if you draw arbitrary illustrations 
here, 
fan tip is always raising fur 
so this we implemented orientation 
sensor inside a pen 
so, regardless pen orientation, 
system 
automatically rotates pen tip so 
that continuously raises fur 
so you see, pen is rotating, 
pen tip stays orientation, 
is 
so, in whichever direction you move, 
you always traces line, leaves a line 
is difficult finger 
so you draw arbitrarily 
pattern using this pen device 
you also fix pattern 
spraying this way, 
you get robust shape 
so heres couple examples, 
carpet drawing 
playing along, a message 
yeah, thats easy 
so let briefly 
describe whats going 
kind obvious, so, in flattened 
fur, lighting comes in 
then, reflected fur surface 
however, if strands raised, 
incoming light 
reflected a lot 
so raised fattened furs, show 
different reflectance property, you know 
in gra, in graphics, this kind 
reflective property is modeled as, 
brdf, 
a bidirectional distribution function 
so defines amount lighting, 
depending incoming light orient 
direction, outgoing light direction 
so this is actual measurement 
fur, fur material 
so you see blue dots representing 
data flattened surface, 
red dots represent raised surface 
if you like, 
take a look this example, you know 
if light is coming here, 
if you observe this direction, 
then, if a, flattened surface, 
reflects a lot, so you say this bright 
in raised fur, 
light go inside fur, so 
you reflection, 
you see much reflection 
so, ill, in result, 
see bright, bright pattern 
in flattened si, region, 
you see dark texture in raised region 
if you, light is, 
come tro, front, so 
different viewed in this direction 
still see a contrast from, 
viewed this direction 
interesting happens here 
so if light is this direction, 
so light is this direction 
so if you view here thing, 
a flattened surface looks bright 
a raised surface looks dark 
here if you 
light is coming in this direction 
observed similar direction, 
actually raised region looks brighter 
flat region looks darker 
so there is a, 
a reverse result is observed 
so, this is a example 
a bidirectional distribution function, 
this is often used in computer 
graphics to synthesize realistic images 
if you want to know more, this is a 
good example document describing idea 
so to learn more, is original 
one is available graffiti fur, 
turning carpet a computer 
display siggraph etech, 
emerging technologies 
so this project is a good 
example cooperative fabrication 
user main action, 
system, robotic system, 
also works together to 
take care details 
we got inspirate, 
inspiration two works 
y is positioned correcting tools 
d digital fabrication 
user is moving along 
cutting device 
that system robotic system 
adjusts actual position blades 
so that you get detailed shape 
using handheld cutting machines 
also otherwise d 
freehand digital sculpting 
so system using handheld 
a meeting device, 
user moving along 
but, position this 
device is observed 
tracked, will automatically turn 
turn depending position 
so user randomly moving 
pen tip, you eventually, 
you get precise sculpture 
so, also this graphic fire walk is 
also related to physical displays 
so instead using 
electronic standard displays 
a couple systems tries to you know, 
present information using 
physical materials 
there many works, 
interesting ones is a wooden mirror, so 
theres lots wooden pieces 
rotating devices, 
reflects face 
in front mirror 
also, 
we also presented a shader printer, so 
this one prints a pattern 
remotely a closed surface 
pattern stays printing 
so this is kind rewritable 
rewritable display 
clothes material 
so thats this week we 
discuss real world interaction 
so user interface for, computing 
systems that work in real world 
we introduce command card interfaces, 
style demonstration 
teaching interactive rote behavior, 
actuated puppet device controlling 
character postures, robotic 
light system painting interface 
also fur display so 
that is this week
