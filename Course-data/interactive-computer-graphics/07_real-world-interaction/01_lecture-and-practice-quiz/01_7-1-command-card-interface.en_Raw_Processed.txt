noise hello, this is week seven 
interactive computer graphics course 
topic we discuss here 
is real world interaction 
cough 
so real world interaction, 
we mean a user interface computing 
systems, working in real world 
so, so far, we discussed user 
interface between computer user 
so user something, computer 
something, theres interaction here 
so here, 
we extend this real world 
so computers connected to real 
world objects like a robot appliances, 
home appliances so we discuss here 
interaction between this kind 
computing systems working in real 
world robots home appliances so 
so heres original topics 
we discussed this week 
so we discussed command card interface 
home robots 
styleby demonstration 
teaching robots behavior, 
actuated puppet device, 
posing a steady characters robotic 
light systems fur display 
so first topic, we discuss is 
command card interface, this one is, 
this work published magic cards 
question here is, to command 
a robot, walking robot in home 
now, typical approach is 
i think is two extremes 
one, simplified, easy to 
use control speech gesture 
abstract control 
however, in cases, 
this is abrupt, simple 
you know, you cannot specify details 
simple command like create here, 
it, go there 
abstract 
also, 
kind commands volatile 
you know, soon you say 
something disappears 
kind a difficult to confirm 
whether you actually gave a command 
source 
also you need to remember command 
is available you speak gesture 
extreme is direct control, 
using joystick gampad somthing 
so you continuously provide command 
system continuously follows a command 
so you everything 
this control details, however 
in cases, 
this is little control, 
tedious to control continuously 
so we try to here is to hit 
middle ground between two extremes 
so this is a method we propose here 
we propose paper card interface 
giving command 
so in the, interenvironment user 
leaves a command card giving instruction 
to robot, clean here, 
deliver this object here, so 
goes out, 
everything happens, robot 
task is going 
so user puts instruction 
card in environment, 
robot job 
while user is 
so thats idea 
let show you a video 
so, first part this 
video is a futuristic view 
so this is a concept video, 
to implemented 
i hope you get idea 
this sequence 
so suppose you a house, messy room, 
messy kitchen, 
throw trash bins is full 
so we need, 
i want robot system to take care 
so, pulls a command card set 
so this one is a combinatory list, 
possible operations you 
give to robot system 
you pick appropriate command 
card leaves in environment, 
like wash this kitchen, 
deliver this to garbage bin, 
take this garbage, 
make bed, so, clean here 
so a good thing this kind 
paper card couple things 
so, first you see a list available 
commands looking is cards set 
so you need to 
remember possible commands 
also leaving a card is 
a clear instruction 
if you want to cancel 
you pick a card 
also a card is a appropriate 
space time physical location 
like clean here, deliver here 
here is ambiguous, 
color location exactly 
space wise location 
so thats a benefit 
goes a robot 
appears to task 
this is a concept video 
real implementations so 
this case robot appears 
job 
so, here we try to 
is mimic interaction 
human human interaction you know a human 
give a message card to another human 
job 
so we try to 
computer system 
so thats 
in evening user comes back 
everything is done 
so this is kind 
envisioned futuristic view 
let show you 
actual implementation 
so, current implementation, fancy, 
there is a basic saying 
we built a system using roomba robots 
so we a couple 
robots working together 
also, we put in environment, 
everything is observed 
ceiling mounted camera 
system continues to 
track command card 
also lowered locations 
so yeah heres system in view in 
what, is actually walking system so 
user give instruction like deliver 
this box here to there 
this location 
vacuum clean this spot 
and, also, remembers task 
user goes 
system starts walking 
see in camera captures 
command cards 
first, system picks command cards 
is in this card pickup 
that, 
system start to job 
first request to deliver here, 
this to here 
so, pushing robot starts to walking 
push to target location 
next, using a grid system 
to vacuum clean this spot 
so vacuum cleaner appears 
clean 
so, thats system 
also, another interesting aspect 
is that reporting errors 
so, user gives instructions to robot, 
a paper card 
and, sometimes system also 
provided feedback to user 
example, system makes an error, 
system present 
error report to user 
an interesting point 
system is that error report is 
also given a paper card 
left in environment 
lets see 
so if robot fails, 
like power is 
small printer, 
mobile printer robot appears 
a printed message to 
user, as, im sorry, i failed 
so this may disclose a loop, you know, 
user provides command paper card 
system provides 
feedback a paper card 
in this way, user interact 
robotic system without touching 
computer, using paper card 
so yeah, environments like 
this we ceiling mounted cameras 
central computers 
remotely controlled robots 
we use visual tab using dimensional 
augmented reality visual code 
backside you see instruction 
user 
so thats a system 
here let briefly describe pushing 
algorithm developed this system 
so this is a pushing algorithm a non 
pre, prehensile, means grabbing 
so yeah, so naive approach is 
two binary state approach 
so first half robot 
go behind object, 
reaching behind object robot going 
to pushing state initialize push 
in middle robots mo, 
may object may move sideways, 
in that case robot go back to behind 
reaching behind 
goes pushing state 
so in reality robot 
needs to go back 
force between two states 
this is desirable 
so, this is unstable 
so, robot can, an unstable status, 
between go back 
force between states 
also this requires 
careful parameter setting 
you know, you need threshold 
distinguish two states 
this parameter sensitive 
so, we propose to avoid this 
we propose to use a dipole field 
to achieve pushing behavior 
so suppose you object here, 
you want to move this object to the, 
this direction 
so, given this object position 
orientation, we compute 
a dipole field center 
that object 
oriented towers target direction 
that, simply we close lower, 
according to this dipole field 
there a couple benefits 
first, theres clear mode switching, 
going behind 
pushing smoothly emerge so theres 
sudden change between two modes 
another thing is that scale invariance 
so, you see dipole field doesnt 
change, even if you scale 
scale 
always shape depend, 
regardless scale 
so means you 
apply allowances, 
parameters to object 
different scales 
so heres a little bit details 
so you object pushing direction, 
desired pushing direction, 
direction you first compute 
local coordinate plane defined 
object position orientation 
you compute position 
robot, relative to this 
object in this coordinate frame 
so, you get cos sin theta 
sin theta, is a distance r 
this theta angle, 
one is simple 
you to is, 
compute sin theta, sin theta 
gives you direction 
is robot look 
this is a finishing 
right field, dipole field, 
you implement this kind here 
very, few lines cords 
so, let show you a brief video 
so, yeah this is basic idea 
system consists 
a seating camera robots 
then, this is a computed dipole field 
robot flows along the, 
flow field 
so in this examples, 
robot pushes a small cup 
movement is small 
there is distinct two modes 
molds together 
here robot tries to push large 
dish exactly using dipole field 
you apply 
algorithm to roomba box, 
to push things floor 
way, this robot is 
easy to control, computer 
so, if you want to try robotic system, 
i recommend to try this system 
another interesting thing is here, 
cooperative pushing 
if object is heavy 
one to push, 
two robots cooperate together 
traditional approach is power pushing, 
you know 
theres always that two, always 
act side side, robot push together 
here, 
we tested singleline serial pushing 
so one simple, 
apply two dipole fields 
here, this robot tries to push this 
box this way, heavy 
this robot pushes this second, 
fast robot 
second robot pushes fast robot, 
again, using a dipole field 
so combining two inaudible then, 
you know, 
robots push relatively heavy object 
motion is going to smooth 
so thats 
so, yeah, so 
we introduce command car based interaction 
pushing outer wards in to achieve 
original paper called magic cards, 
paper tag interface 
implicit robot control 
paper id we used is a popular one 
visual two dimensional 
bar code to measure a dipoles, 
frequently used in 
augmented reality systems 
original paper published in 
metrics real time 
object identification 
registration method augmented reality 
if you want to use theres 
a popular toolkit called ar toolkit, 
i recommend you to try it, if you want 
pushing algorithm, we 
published a paper dipole field 
object delivery pushing 
a flat surface 
so if you want to look pushing 
algorithm please take a look 
this paper 
thank you
