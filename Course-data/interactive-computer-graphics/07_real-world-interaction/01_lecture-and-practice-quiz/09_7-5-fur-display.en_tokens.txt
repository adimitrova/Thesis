last
topic
of
this
week
is
,
fur
display
.
and
the
work
we
present
here
is
titled
,
graffiti
fur
,
turning
your
carpet
into
computer
display
.
so
,
in
special
reason
here
,
if
you
have
a
carpet
or
fur
,
using
your
finger
you
trace
a
line
.
so
,
this
is
our
inspiration
and
we
take
this
.
the
phenomenon
on
the
display
device
.
so
let
me
show
you
a
video
.
oh
yeah
,
here
is
the
inspiration
.
you
can
trace
a
line
in
a
fur
with
your
finger
,
and
you
can
quickly
erase
it
.
and
then
we
developed
a
computational
devices
to
do
this
.
so
,
what
is
a
roller
type
device
?
so
this
one
consist
of
lots
of
servomotors
,
moving
,
driving
the
rod
,
to
raise
the
fur
.
so
,
as
the
roller
device
roll
along
the
surface
,
then
it
rotates
.
on
the
rotary
encoder
it
takes
a
rotation
,
and
then
moves
pins
up
and
down
.
so
if
these
rods
or
pins
are
down
,
it
raise
[
inaudible
]
.
so
as
you
drag
it
moves
down
,
up
and
down
and
then
leaves
a
pattern
and
then
you
can
create
a
pattern
using
pixel
painting
or
.
combines
them
from
your
photograph
and
others
.
and
so
,
in
order
to
paint
with
multiple
nodes
,
then
we
provide
a
mark
,
tick
mark
here
so
you
can
easily
align
multiple
traces
using
this
tick
mark
.
and
here
is
an
example
of
drawing
a
large
pattern
,
on
large
carpet
.
so
,
the
user
prepares
a
bitmap
image
before
hand
,
and
then
it
's
data
to
like
this
handheld
device
.
so
this
is
an
interesting
example
of
cooperative
fabrication
,
of
cooperative
action
with
human
and
robot
system
.
so
user
is
also
doing
something
but
also
robot
also
doing
something
together
with
the
user
.
and
another
device
we
developed
is
the
pen
type
device
.
so
,
this
is
a
continuously
rotating
wheel
.
and
this
wheel
,
with
rubber
,
the
rubber
wheel
raises
the
fur
.
and
the
important
thing
is
that
,
when
you
,
you
are
using
your
finger
,
you
can
draw
a
line
in
one
direction
,
but
you
can
not
draw
a
line
in
the
opposite
direction
.
so
this
can
be
inconvenient
,
inconvenient
if
you
draw
arbitrary
illustrations
.
but
here
,
the
fan
tip
is
always
raising
the
fur
.
so
this
we
implemented
orientation
sensor
inside
of
a
pen
.
so
,
regardless
of
your
pen
orientation
,
the
system
automatically
rotates
the
pen
tip
so
that
it
can
continuously
raises
the
fur
.
so
as
you
see
,
as
the
pen
is
rotating
,
but
the
pen
tip
stays
the
same
orientation
,
as
is
.
so
,
in
whichever
direction
you
move
,
you
can
always
traces
line
,
leaves
a
line
.
which
is
difficult
with
finger
.
so
you
can
draw
arbitrarily
pattern
using
this
pen
device
.
you
can
also
fix
the
pattern
by
spraying
this
way
,
and
then
you
get
more
robust
shape
.
so
here
's
couple
of
examples
,
carpet
drawing
.
playing
along
,
a
message
.
yeah
,
that
's
easy
.
so
let
me
briefly
describe
what
's
going
on
.
kind
of
obvious
,
but
so
,
in
the
flattened
fur
,
the
lighting
comes
in
and
then
,
reflected
by
the
fur
surface
.
however
,
if
the
strands
are
raised
,
then
incoming
light
does
not
be
reflected
a
lot
.
so
our
raised
and
fattened
furs
,
show
different
reflectance
property
,
you
know
?
and
in
gra
,
in
graphics
,
this
kind
of
reflective
property
is
modeled
as
,
the
brdf
,
a
bi-directional
distribution
function
.
so
it
defines
the
amount
of
lighting
,
depending
on
the
incoming
light
orient
direction
,
and
outgoing
light
direction
.
so
this
is
actual
measurement
from
our
fur
,
fur
material
.
so
you
see
blue
dots
representing
the
data
from
the
flattened
surface
,
and
the
red
dots
represent
the
raised
surface
.
and
if
you
like
,
take
a
look
at
this
example
,
you
know
.
the
if
light
is
coming
from
here
,
and
then
if
you
observe
it
from
this
direction
,
then
,
if
it
's
a
,
on
the
flattened
surface
,
it
reflects
a
lot
,
so
you
say
this
bright
.
but
in
the
raised
fur
,
then
light
go
inside
over
the
fur
,
so
you
do
not
reflection
,
you
do
not
see
much
reflection
.
so
,
i
'll
,
in
the
result
,
these
are
see
bright
,
bright
pattern
in
the
flattened
si
,
region
,
and
you
see
dark
texture
in
the
raised
region
.
and
then
if
you
,
light
is
,
come
from
tro
,
front
,
then
not
so
different
viewed
in
this
direction
.
but
still
see
a
contrast
from
,
viewed
from
this
direction
.
interesting
happens
here
.
so
if
the
light
is
from
this
direction
,
so
light
is
this
direction
.
so
if
you
view
from
here
the
same
thing
,
a
flattened
surface
looks
bright
.
and
a
raised
surface
looks
dark
.
up
here
if
you
.
light
is
coming
in
from
this
direction
and
observed
from
the
similar
direction
,
then
actually
raised
region
looks
brighter
and
the
flat
region
looks
darker
.
so
there
is
a
,
a
reverse
result
is
observed
.
so
,
this
is
a
example
of
a
bi-directional
distribution
function
,
and
this
is
often
used
in
computer
graphics
to
synthesize
realistic
images
.
and
if
you
want
to
know
more
,
this
is
a
good
example
document
describing
the
idea
.
so
to
learn
more
,
is
original
who
one
is
available
as
graffiti
fur
,
turning
your
carpet
into
a
computer
display
at
siggraph
2014
e-tech
,
emerging
technologies
.
and
so
this
project
is
a
good
example
of
cooperative
fabrication
.
the
user
does
the
main
action
,
but
the
system
,
robotic
system
,
also
works
together
to
take
care
of
the
details
.
and
we
got
inspirate
,
inspiration
from
these
two
works
.
the
y
is
positioned
correcting
tools
for
2d
digital
fabrication
.
the
user
is
moving
along
the
cutting
device
.
and
then
that
system
or
robotic
system
adjusts
the
actual
position
of
the
blades
so
that
you
can
get
detailed
shape
using
these
hand-held
cutting
machines
.
and
they
also
are
otherwise
3d
freehand
digital
sculpting
.
so
the
system
using
hand-held
.
a
meeting
device
,
and
the
user
moving
along
.
but
,
the
position
of
this
device
is
observed
or
tracked
,
and
it
will
automatically
turn
on
and
turn
off
depending
on
the
position
.
so
the
user
just
randomly
moving
the
pen
tip
,
but
you
eventually
,
you
get
very
precise
sculpture
.
so
,
also
this
graphic
fire
walk
is
also
related
to
physical
displays
.
so
instead
of
using
electronic
standard
displays
.
a
couple
of
systems
tries
to
you
know
,
present
information
using
physical
materials
.
and
there
are
many
works
,
but
interesting
ones
is
a
wooden
mirror
,
so
there
's
lots
of
wooden
pieces
with
rotating
devices
,
and
then
it
reflects
your
face
in
front
of
the
mirror
.
and
also
,
we
also
presented
a
shader
printer
,
so
this
one
prints
a
pattern
remotely
on
a
closed
surface
.
and
the
pattern
stays
after
the
printing
.
so
this
is
kind
of
re-writable
the
re-writable
display
on
the
clothes
material
.
so
that
's
it
and
this
week
we
discuss
real
world
interaction
.
so
user
interface
for
,
with
computing
systems
that
work
in
the
real
world
.
and
we
introduce
command
card
interfaces
,
style
by
demonstration
for
teaching
interactive
rote
behavior
,
and
actuated
puppet
device
for
controlling
character
postures
,
and
then
robotic
light
system
with
painting
interface
.
and
also
fur
display
so
that
is
for
this
week
.
