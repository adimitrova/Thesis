1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,560
Last topic of this week is, fur display.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,580
And the work we present here is titled,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,850
Graffiti Fur,
Turning Your Carpet into Computer Display.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,750
So, in special reason here,
if you have a carpet or

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,710
fur, using your finger you trace a line.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,600
So, this is our inspiration and
we take this.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,410
The phenomenon on the display device.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,200
So let me show you a video.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,710
Oh yeah, here is the inspiration.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,120
You can trace a line in a fur with your
finger, and you can quickly erase it.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,209
And then we developed
a computational devices to do this.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,320
So, what is a Roller Type Device?

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,330
So this one consist of lots
of servomotors, moving,

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,970
driving the rod, to raise the fur.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,260
So, as the roller device roll along
the surface, then it rotates.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,410
On the Rotary Encoder it takes a rotation,
and then moves pins up and down.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,813
So if these rods or pins are down,
it raise [INAUDIBLE].

18
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:15,060
So as you drag it moves down, up and
down and then leaves a pattern and

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,600
then you can create a pattern
using pixel painting or.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,845
Combines them from your photograph and
others.

21
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:30,170
And so,
in order to paint with multiple nodes,

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,520
then we provide a mark, tick mark here so

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,630
you can easily align multiple
traces using this tick mark.

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,310
And here is an example of drawing
a large pattern, on large carpet.

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,340
So, the user prepares
a bitmap image before hand,

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,110
and then it's data to like
this handheld device.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,460
So this is an interesting example
of cooperative fabrication,

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,580
of cooperative action with human and
robot system.

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,698
So user is also doing something but

30
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:14,509
also robot also doing something
together with the user.

31
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,070
And another device we developed
is the Pen Type Device.

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,360
So, this is a continuously rotating wheel.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
And this wheel, with rubber,
the rubber wheel raises the fur.

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,690
And the important thing is that, when you,
you are using your finger, you can draw

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,960
a line in one direction, but you cannot
draw a line in the opposite direction.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,080
So this can be inconvenient, inconvenient
if you draw arbitrary illustrations.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,860
But here,
the fan tip is always raising the fur.

38
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:53,360
So this we implemented orientation
sensor inside of a pen.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,050
So, regardless of your pen orientation,
the system

40
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,920
automatically rotates the pen tip so
that it can continuously raises the fur.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,391
So as you see, as the pen is rotating, but

42
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:08,222
the pen tip stays the same orientation,
as is.

43
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:19,390
So, in whichever direction you move,
you can always traces line, leaves a line.

44
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,400
Which is difficult with finger.

45
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,280
So you can draw arbitrarily
pattern using this pen device.

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,503
You can also fix the pattern
by spraying this way, and

47
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,390
then you get more robust shape.

48
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:00,470
So here's couple of examples,
carpet drawing.

49
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,965
Playing along, a message.

50
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:18,220
Yeah, that's easy.

51
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,085
So let me briefly
describe what's going on.

52
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:27,000
Kind of obvious, but So, in the flattened
fur, the lighting comes in and

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,370
then, reflected by the fur surface.

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,910
However, if the strands are raised,

55
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,410
then incoming light does
not be reflected a lot.

56
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,780
So our raised and fattened furs, show
different reflectance property, you know?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,977
And in gra, in graphics, this kind of
reflective property is modeled as,

58
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:55,200
the BRDF,
a bi-directional Distribution Function.

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,640
So it defines the amount of lighting,

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,200
depending on the incoming light orient
direction, and outgoing light direction.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,150
So this is actual measurement
from our fur, fur material.

62
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,180
So you see blue dots representing
the data from the flattened surface, and

63
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,220
the red dots represent the raised surface.

64
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,379
And if you like,
take a look at this example, you know.

65
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,660
The if light is coming from here, and then
if you observe it from this direction,

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,020
then, if it's a, on the flattened surface,
it reflects a lot, so you say this bright.

67
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,160
But in the raised fur,
then light go inside over the fur, so

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,650
you do not reflection,
you do not see much reflection.

69
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,100
So, I'll, in the result,
these are see bright, bright pattern

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,340
in the flattened si, region, and
you see dark texture in the raised region.

71
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,160
And then if you, light is,
come from tro, front, then not so

72
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,570
different viewed in this direction.

73
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,750
But still see a contrast from,
viewed from this direction.

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,610
Interesting happens here.

75
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,480
So if the light is from this direction,
so light is this direction.

76
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,570
So if you view from here the same thing,
a flattened surface looks bright.

77
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,970
And a raised surface looks dark.

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,970
Up here if you.

79
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,589
Light is coming in from this direction and
observed from the similar direction,

80
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,930
then actually raised region looks brighter
and the flat region looks darker.

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,890
So there is a,
a reverse result is observed.

82
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:44,240
So, this is a example of
a bi-directional Distribution Function,

83
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,920
and this is often used in computer
graphics to synthesize realistic images.

84
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,368
And if you want to know more, this is a
good example document describing the idea.

85
00:06:55,368 --> 00:07:01,227
So to learn more, is original who
one is available as Graffiti Fur,

86
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:07,374
Turning Your Carpet into a Computer
Display at SIGGRAPH 2014 e-tech,

87
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:10,310
emerging technologies.

88
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,290
And so this project is a good
example of cooperative fabrication.

89
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,830
The user does the main action,
but the system, robotic system,

90
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,970
also works together to
take care of the details.

91
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,050
And we got inspirate,
inspiration from these two works.

92
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,620
The Y is positioned correcting tools for
2D digital fabrication.

93
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,350
The user is moving along
the cutting device.

94
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,600
And then that system or robotic system
adjusts the actual position of the blades

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,990
so that you can get detailed shape
using these hand-held cutting machines.

96
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,830
And they also are otherwise 3D
freehand digital sculpting.

97
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,500
So the system using hand-held.

98
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,210
A meeting device, and
the user moving along.

99
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,380
But, the position of this
device is observed or

100
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,020
tracked, and it will automatically turn on
and turn off depending on the position.

101
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,540
So the user just randomly moving
the pen tip, but you eventually,

102
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,839
you get very precise sculpture.

103
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,360
so, also this graphic Fire Walk is
also related to Physical Displays.

104
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,040
So instead of using
Electronic Standard Displays.

105
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,780
A couple of systems tries to you know,

106
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,320
present information using
physical materials.

107
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,830
And there are many works, but
interesting ones is a wooden Mirror, so

108
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,060
there's lots of wooden pieces
with rotating devices, and

109
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,940
then it reflects your face
in front of the mirror.

110
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,450
And also,
we also presented a Shader printer, so

111
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,930
this one prints a pattern
remotely on a closed surface.

112
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,910
And the pattern stays after the printing.

113
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,790
So this is kind of re-writable
the re-writable display on

114
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,810
the clothes material.

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,210
So that's it and this week we
discuss real world interaction.

116
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,150
So user interface for, with computing
systems that work in the real world.

117
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,810
And we introduce command card interfaces,
style by demonstration for

118
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,340
teaching interactive rote behavior, and
actuated puppet device for controlling

119
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,780
character postures, and then robotic
light system with painting interface.

120
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,430
And also fur display so
that is for this week.
