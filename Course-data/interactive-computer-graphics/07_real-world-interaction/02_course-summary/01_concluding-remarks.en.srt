1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,950
So here we briefly, I briefly conclude
this course with some remarks.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,010
So in this course I discussed
interactive techniques and systems for

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,060
visual problem solving.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,990
And interactive,
I mean not fully automatic.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,890
So instead of asking system
to do the everything.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,680
Or we try to augment human activity.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,960
So user do something, and then computer
tries to provide help or assistance.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,040
And also this course was
about visual problem solving.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,400
And by visual problem
solving [COUGH] we try to.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,830
Assist all the aspects of human
visual problem solving, which means

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,890
a comprehension owing input input
information and those are conceptions of

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,390
a new solutions and the communication
was a new idea to the others.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,639
And we hope that the we presented here can
be helpful to assist these activities.

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,680
And just a recap.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,210
So in this course we
discussed these topics.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,360
We first discussed improvements
to graphical user interfaces.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,050
And then we discussed how to make some
2D drawings and how to animate them.

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,950
And then we discussed
how to create 3D models.

19
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,320
From architectural shapes,
or organic shapes and so on.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,930
And then we discuss how to deform it,
change shape, and

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,160
also make animate them along the timeline.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,100
And then we, we move out to,
go into the real world and

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,830
then we discuss how to fabricate
3D models as a real object.

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,830
And also we discuss how to leverage
real-time physical simulation for

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,510
assistance, for assisting the design or
physically valid objects.

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,120
And then finally we discuss
interaction techniques with

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,460
computing systems working
in the real world.

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,800
And I think these are techniques and

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,240
ideas, presented in this course
can be applicable to many, many.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,610
Areas are for

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,710
medicine, sports, engineering,
fashion and science and so on.

32
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,501
So I hope you apply what you learned here,
to your own programs.

33
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:20,288
So that's basically it and

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,922
here I want to address one frequently
asked questions I got, after I giving.

35
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,270
Similar talks other places.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,600
The question I get most
frequently is like this.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,570
How do you conceive these
interesting new original ideas?

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,800
Well this is not exactly
related to this course topic,

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,000
but I think this is a good opportunity
to address this, discuss this thing.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,250
And the obvious answer is of course,
there is no easy answer, you know?

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,450
There's no easy solution,
you have to work hard.

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,070
But still, there's a couple tips
that I want to discuss here.

43
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,280
So what I want to present here,
is three things.

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,160
In order to get new ideas, new solutions,
you have to do three things.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
You have to think hard.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,870
You have to learn a lot,
and you have to try a lot,

47
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,950
and I think many people say the same
thing in many different context, but

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,320
let me describe this in my own words here.

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,060
So first, you have to think hard.

50
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,448
As a student, you may have limited
experience of thinking one program for

51
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,420
a long time.

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,100
Maybe, thinking a program,
ten minutes, one hour, few hours.

53
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,160
However, if we want to really
solve a problem as a professional,

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,910
you have to think long time, persistently.

55
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,910
Not one day, not few days, few weeks,
even a few months, to solve a problem.

56
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,220
And sometimes, it takes few years or
ten years, to solve a problem.

57
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,590
And in some,
if you think about the problem for

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,300
long enough, at some point,
you may come up with a new solution.

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,560
So you have to think hard.

60
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,770
And, you should not just think abse,
absently.

61
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,240
You should focus on, on it,
and systematically explore.

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,770
You have to consider option A, B,

63
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,270
C and then within A again you
have sub options, A, B, C.

64
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,520
So you should think about the program,
if it doesn't work, if it doesn't work,

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,150
you have to move to the second prob,
second possibilities, and so on,

66
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,330
so you should be very systematic,
like a playing a game, chess game.

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,760
And then, as I said,
you should be persistent.

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,700
You should be,
thinking about a particular problem for

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,360
long time, but at the same time, you
should be not focused on a single topic.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,440
You should, thinking about
the parallel problem simultaneously,

71
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,660
then somewhere with the problem,
you come up with a solution.

72
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,290
But you, it's very important to do
it in parallel for a long time.

73
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,270
So next thing is learning.

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,310
You cannot get everything by yourself.

75
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,430
You should learn from others.

76
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,400
So oh, but the problem is that
learning is easy because so

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
many information is available.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,780
The program is just too many information.

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,070
So there,
it's very important to be efficient.

80
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,400
So you should not try to
understand everything.

81
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,300
You should try to get the essence.

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,010
Efficiently.

83
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,620
And a good tip is to learn classics and
also recent ones.

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,360
And ignore in the middle.

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,400
So, any research topic, any topic has
a long history from the beginning,

86
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,910
also intermediate experiences in the mid,
in the past, and recent one.

87
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,290
And my recommendation is study the
original one, because it's very new, and

88
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,000
it's very inspiring.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,330
But and also, the recent one.

90
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,440
The recent one is a result
of long research history.

91
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,770
Long exploration.

92
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,570
So it contains the information,
obtained in the long long days.

93
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,250
So I recommend you to take out
the beginning, the first one, and

94
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,369
also the recent ones.

95
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,660
And also talk to experts.

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,770
It's tentative it's tentative,

97
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,790
temptive to just learn
everything through the Internet.

98
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,310
You can, it seems like you can
get from everything from the net.

99
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,880
However, it's more efficient actually and
more productive just to talk to experts.

100
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,610
And then you can learn a lot more
directly from from them, talking to them.

101
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,170
Meet people.

102
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,090
So finally, just thinking and
just learning is not enough.

103
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,440
You cannot get anything.

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,670
You should try.

105
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,300
So do it yourself.

106
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,500
So in computer science, what it means
is you should implement it and test it.

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
And even if the idea is not so

108
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,700
promise, promising, if you implement it,
you can get more ideas.

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,740
And more information.

110
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,750
So you can learn a lot and you can think,
you can get more inspirations.

111
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,570
So yeah.

112
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,810
So this is basically a Rapid Prototyping.

113
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,030
So if you want to produce something new,

114
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,210
you should prototype many
variation systematically.

115
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,460
And you eventually get a,
very sophisticated solution.

116
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

117
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,190
So if you want to learn
more here's a tips.

118
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,310
So as I said,
anything is available on the net.

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,550
You can get anything.

120
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,640
But you cannot learn everything.

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,200
So my recommendation is pick what is
most interesting for you, and master it.

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,070
You know, implement it,
learn it, think about it.

123
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,510
So instead of trying to
understand everything,

124
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,330
very widely, you should focus
on single thing, and then.

125
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,640
Last eight.

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,200
And I hope, this course helps you
to find interesting topic for you.

127
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,690
Anything like fabrication, or
2D graphics, 3D modeling, or

128
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,330
maybe the other world interaction.

129
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,510
Something you, catches your heart and

130
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,750
I hope help you explore it further,
by yourself.

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,740
So if you want to know more good resources
starting is academic conferences.

132
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,440
So they are the best place to get
the latest most polished result.

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,330
So Walk, we introduce, I introduce in
this course are all first appeared as

134
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,890
a publication in these conferences.

135
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,660
So if you want to know
what's going on recently,

136
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,000
you should take a look
at these conferences.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,430
Most resources like papers and
videos are available on the net.

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,760
And if you want to learn more,
you can go to, to the conference and

139
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,280
meet people and have discussion.

140
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,960
And finally I want to say thank you
to all collaborators of the works I

141
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,480
presented in this course.

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,730
So of course, we can,
I cannot do everything by myself.

143
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,550
And the result, the project presented in
this course, was a result of hard work,

144
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,200
of all these collaborators.

145
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,350
So I would like to,
thank you to all of these people.

146
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,090
So, that's the end of this course,
and thank you for joining us.

147
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,590
Bye.
