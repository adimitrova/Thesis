so here we briefly, i briefly conclude 
this course remarks 
so in this course i discussed 
interactive techniques systems 
visual problem solving 
interactive, 
i mean fully automatic 
so instead asking system 
to everything 
we try to augment human activity 
so user something, computer 
tries to provide help assistance 
also this course 
visual problem solving 
visual problem 
solving cough we try to 
assist aspects human 
visual problem solving, means 
a comprehension owing input input 
information conceptions 
a new solutions communication 
a new idea to others 
we hope that we presented here 
helpful to assist activities 
a recap 
so in this course we 
discussed topics 
we first discussed improvements 
to graphical user interfaces 
we discussed to make 
d drawings to animate 
we discussed 
to create d models 
architectural shapes, 
organic shapes so 
we discuss to deform it, 
change shape, 
also make animate along timeline 
we, we move to, 
go real world 
we discuss to fabricate 
d models a real object 
also we discuss to leverage 
realtime physical simulation 
assistance, assisting design 
physically valid objects 
finally we discuss 
interaction techniques 
computing systems working 
in real world 
i think techniques 
ideas, presented in this course 
applicable to many, many 
areas 
medicine, sports, engineering, 
fashion science so 
so i hope you apply you learned here, 
to programs 
so thats basically 
here i want to address one frequently 
asked questions i got, i giving 
similar talks places 
question i get 
frequently is like this 
you conceive 
interesting new original ideas 
well this is exactly 
related to this course topic, 
i think this is a good opportunity 
to address this, discuss this thing 
obvious answer is course, 
there is easy answer, you know 
theres easy solution, 
you to work hard 
still, theres a couple tips 
that i want to discuss here 
so i want to present here, 
is three things 
in order to get new ideas, new solutions, 
you to three things 
you to think hard 
you to learn a lot, 
you to try a lot, 
i think many people say 
thing in many different context, 
let describe this in words here 
so first, you to think hard 
a student, you may limited 
experience thinking one program 
a long time 
maybe, thinking a program, 
ten minutes, one hour, few hours 
however, if we want to really 
solve a problem a professional, 
you to think long time, persistently 
one day, few days, few weeks, 
even a few months, to solve a problem 
sometimes, takes few years 
ten years, to solve a problem 
in some, 
if you think problem 
long enough, point, 
you may come a new solution 
so you to think hard 
and, you think abse, 
absently 
you focus on, it, 
systematically explore 
you to consider option a, b, 
c within a you 
sub options, a, b, c 
so you think program, 
if doesnt work, if doesnt work, 
you to move to second prob, 
second possibilities, so on, 
so you systematic, 
like a playing a game, chess game 
then, i said, 
you persistent 
you be, 
thinking a particular problem 
long time, time, you 
focused a single topic 
you should, thinking 
parallel problem simultaneously, 
somewhere problem, 
you come a solution 
you, important to 
in parallel a long time 
so next thing is learning 
you cannot get everything 
you learn others 
so oh, problem is that 
learning is easy so 
many information is available 
program is many information 
so there, 
important to efficient 
so you try to 
understand everything 
you try to get essence 
efficiently 
a good tip is to learn classics 
also recent ones 
ignore in middle 
so, research topic, topic 
a long history beginning, 
also intermediate experiences in mid, 
in past, recent one 
recommendation is study 
original one, new, 
inspiring 
also, recent one 
recent one is a result 
long research history 
long exploration 
so contains information, 
obtained in long long days 
so i recommend you to take 
beginning, first one, 
also recent ones 
also talk to experts 
tentative tentative, 
temptive to learn 
everything internet 
you can, seems like you 
get everything net 
however, efficient actually 
productive to talk to experts 
you learn a lot 
directly them, talking to 
meet people 
so finally, thinking 
learning is enough 
you cannot get anything 
you try 
so 
so in computer science, means 
is you implement test 
even if idea is so 
promise, promising, if you implement it, 
you get ideas 
information 
so you learn a lot you think, 
you get inspirations 
so yeah 
so this is basically a rapid prototyping 
so if you want to produce something new, 
you prototype many 
variation systematically 
you eventually get a, 
sophisticated solution 
okay 
so if you want to learn 
heres a tips 
so i said, 
anything is available net 
you get anything 
you cannot learn everything 
so recommendation is pick is 
interesting you, master 
you know, implement it, 
learn it, think 
so instead trying to 
understand everything, 
widely, you focus 
single thing, 
last eight 
i hope, this course helps you 
to find interesting topic you 
anything like fabrication, 
d graphics, d modeling, 
maybe world interaction 
something you, catches heart 
i hope help you explore further, 

so if you want to know good resources 
starting is academic conferences 
so best place to get 
latest polished result 
so walk, we introduce, i introduce in 
this course first appeared 
a publication in conferences 
so if you want to know 
whats going recently, 
you take a look 
conferences 
resources like papers 
videos available net 
if you want to learn more, 
you go to, to conference 
meet people discussion 
finally i want to say thank you 
to collaborators works i 
presented in this course 
so course, we can, 
i cannot everything 
result, project presented in 
this course, a result hard work, 
collaborators 
so i would like to, 
thank you to people 
so, thats end this course, 
thank you joining us 
bye
