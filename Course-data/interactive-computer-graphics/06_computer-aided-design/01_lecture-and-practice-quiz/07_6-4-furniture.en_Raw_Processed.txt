next topic is furniture design 
so work we introduce here is a guided 
exploration physically valid shapes 
furniture design 
so motivation, 
question we want to address here is 
to design valid furniture 
like a shelf a table 
so problem we consider 
is robustness stability 
robustness means, means break 
this one example, is you this kind 
shelf you put heavy object here, 
this nail break, bent 
so this is a problem we to avoid 
also if you get this shape 
you put this heavy weight here, 
this would probably topple 
so problem we want to avoid 
however, in this simple case 
easy to see if you a 
complicated shape like this one, 
hard to see to design valid furniture 
so thats a problem we want addressed 
approach is like previous 
systems we introduced so far, we provide 
continuous structure simulation 
so given user input, 
system applied physical analysis 
identify is valid invalid so 
you continuously part 
addition to in this work we 
also provide active guidance to 
maintain validity 
so in addition telling you, 
you invalid you valid 
system also guides user 
to recover validity 
example, 
if user in this invalid region, 
you design is invalid 
telling that you bad 
also tell you to fix 
so system is continuously provide 
active feedback to go back to 
valid region 
so this is farther assist user 
in design process, so thats idea 
this is a special 
technique we will introduce, 
is one annotation indicating valid range 
so here, in this angle, 
is good, durable 
so, if you put weight here, 
this nail will broken 
however, if you rotate this, 
plank to vertical, 
becomes stable, 
robust, doesnt break 
if you go beyond farther 
robust, durable 
so system compute valid range 
angle you manipulating 
visualizing another annotation so 
internally system runs many simulations 
finds valid divisions 
so this is stability analysis 
annotation 
so another is stability 
so here system identifies that 
this configuration is stable 
if you physically fabricate this, 
this will topple 
so this is a inaudible 
in addition to providing this feedback, 
system also provides suggestions 
showing valid designs 
so user provide this, 
telling user this is stable, 
system generates body 
candidates this way 
user speaks long 
you get product design 
so let show you a video 
sound 
so, this is a user interface, so 
user design shape, 
a simple logging operations 
yeah 
nothing special so far 
so here, 
a user start rotating this plank 
if angle is much, 
this joint will collapse 
system profile is 
durable feedback 
in addition, this durable indicator, 
system shows a valid lane 
so in this range okay 
yeah, so this is a visualization 
so, this is much helpful 
telling you durable 
you can, system also 
provides visual feedback 
yeah, this is body domains 
preventing toppling 
system also provides balance 
in a number positions 
if this is geometric analysis if 
disconnected system suggest 
multiple choices to fix discontinuity 
here in 
this situation will topple, so system 
suggest multiple candidates to fix 
yeah, in this case durable so 
systems suggested lower it, 
remove lower bar support 
let show you a little bit 
complicated example 
yeah, so design gets 
complicated hard to see 
is bottle neck is a body 
this kind system helpful to 
design physically bodied complicated shape 
like this one 
we also fabricated l one so 
in this case we designed a chair 
noise okay, so 
let briefly 
describe whats going inside 
so we presenting is to prevent 
breaking to prevent toppling 
so first one is robustness analysis 
so if analyze bend force joints 
also in prevent toppling we put, 
analyze force, 
contact force ground 
so let explain one one 
so okay lets ask to, let 
clarify to prevent breaking 
so, suppose we this kind 
configuration, three planks two nails 
we try to find region 
nail is placed 
in, 
to this we consider a space spanned by, 
nail joint bending forces 
so we compute bending force 
this nail nail , 
we put designs, 
in space spanned forces, 
applied bending force 
right to sets 
example, in this configuration, 
is located here 
you know theres no, 
if theres bending force, 
lambda equal zero 
lambda is somewhere here 
so this is best thing, 
so compute bending force 
you put current design in this space 
that we bodied range 
right, if bending force is light, 
large, durable 
so bending force smaller 
a specific threshold 
is end 
a kind box region 
so if design is inside this region 
durable, safe, okay 
if outside 
durable okay 
so system needs to suggest 
going back to this region 
so yeah, so 
value to design is somewhere here 
so task is moving here to there 
so thats starting point 
we is something like this 
so given current, 
spin, non durable design 
we gradually change a parameter 
we check project tree 
you know, gradually change design 
you rotate in this fourth space 
then, you see a trajectory 
so if you change one thing, 
you get this trajectory, 
if you change another thing, 
you will get another trajectory 
so in system, 
we test various trajectories, you know 
one point we try to change angle here, 
in somewhere else, 
you try to position something else 
we try many different variety 
operations check trajectory 
then, checking trajectory, 
we pick one going safe 
region show it, a result 
so internally, systems learns a lot 
physical simulation we 
explain data here, internally we 
giving you sensitivity analysis 
so is a linear approximation 
so instead computing individual one, 
we approximating so 
linear single line you 
arithmetically compute collision, 
safe collision faster 
so thats whats going 
prevent toppling 
so this is also similar 
so here we compute contact force between 
furniture leg also ground 
this force in one direction, 
you know, force 
action force comes 
floor to furniture 
if force is pointed side, 
means that floor 
means that there is a problem 
so in force space diagram 
looks like this, so if 
so contact force 
always positive 
you know 
contact force needs, 
needs to positive, if negative, 
means that contact becomes fall 
apart means furniture 
topples over, stumbles 
so in, task is to move design 
back this valid region 
so again, thing 
you compute trajectory 
checking many variations 
to identify find good one 
ok, so little bit, maybe fast 
thats a brief summary 
so, we presented furniture design 
durability, stability analysis 
so system continously checks whether 
current design stable durable 
in addition to that, 
system actively guide user 
to go back to valid region 
so to so, internally, we apply joint 
force analysis in force space 
so in case durability we compute 
bending force force stability 
we compute contact force we 
try to move back safe region 
so to learn more, original paper 
published guided exploration 
physically valid shapes 
furniture design 
physically valid design 
objects is popular 
topic in this entry, a couple 
interesting works appear in this entry 
one is make stand balancing 
shapes d fabrication 
so this technique takes single d object 
tries to adjust shapes so 
that actually stands, topple 
so this is automatic optimization 
another is, 
stress relief improving structural 
strength d printable objects 
so this one takes d object print 
however also analyzes weakest 
bottle neck example, this neck 
easily break, so system identifies it, 
make stronger 
so this kind condition 
is heavily explored 
work is different we try to 
guide user modeling phase 
thats it, thank you
