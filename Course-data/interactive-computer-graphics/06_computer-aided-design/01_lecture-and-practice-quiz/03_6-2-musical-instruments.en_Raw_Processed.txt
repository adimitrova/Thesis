okay 
so, next topic is, 
design novel musical instruments, 
like a metallophone 
title, we introduce, is a work the, 
work, work we introduce here is 
titled designing custommade metallophone 
concurrent eigenanalysis 
so problem we want to 
discuss in here is to, 
to design an original 
musical instrument 
so, we pick metallophone, in this project 
you see, 
is difficult to find a proper 
shape that produce appropriate sound 
you know, in order to function, 
a musical instrument, 
need to produce appropriate sound 
however, difficult to predict 
sound produce theyre hit 
a stick 
you know 
so thats a very, 
again, difficult 
constrained design problem 
however, if you a computer, 
computer predict sound 
if you run it, continuously, 
rapidly, fairly useful 
so user edits shape, a bar, 
a metallophone system continuously 
lands physical simulation to predict 
feedback audio produce, tone 
user see, hear sound 
then, if high, 
goes back to previous one, 
low, go to side 
so in this way, user 
interactively explore, a body shape, 
while also searching 
aesthetically pleasing shape 
so thats idea 
let show you a video 
okay, so here is a video 
in this example, to 
bleep 
so here, right side, 
you see a two denominational pattern, 
a metallophone you designing 
so this is a standard, editing software 
you change shape dragging 
right side you see 
that simulation is 
visualize happens if you 
hit this metal bar, stick 
if stake is a bar, vibrates 
produces sound, 
this is a visualization vibration 
course, this is exaggerated, 
you see result 
then, in addition to 
system also produce a sound, 
predicting tone, pitch 
so user hear it, using ears 
so while hearing sound, 
you add to save 
so that you get interesting shape 
also satisfies desire a sound 
sound a metallophone is calculated 
a eigenvalue analysis bleep 
user edits metallophone 
shape in left window, 
system immediately 
computes eigenmode 
show in right window, 
tells metallophone 
oscillating this space 
tone is also updated oral 
feedback using beep sounds, 
visual feedback in status bar 
bleep 
change tone caused 
shape addict is difficult to predict, 
we believe designing a metallophone 
desire shape 
tone will possible 
a responsive inaudible 
so, way, this visualization 
is actually also useful you, 
physically assemble metallophone 
you know metallophone in order to, 
in order to make a metallophone you 
to put this bar, onto base 
however, a question 
to to fix 
in this view, you see that 
this part is vibrate a lot 
so this part fixed 
this part 
this part is moving all, so 
this is a good place to place 
bleep 
here are, designed 
metallophone pieces an artist 
sound 
actual creation 
sound 
this shows that analysis 
successfully simulates real world 
sound 
yeah 
so, 
again, i think this kind designs very, 
difficult assimilation 
existing measured 
continuous feedback, you 
explore many possibilities rapidly, 
you design this kind 
interesting shape, appropriate sound 
so yeah, in words, we, 
we briefly describe algorithm 
again, we use finite elements simulation, 
so we go to details 
i give you an, a basic idea 
so problem is to find 
frequency vibration 
here, 
method we use is eigenmode analysis 
let give a very, 
brief abstract explanation 
so this a equation 
defining this phenomenon 
so, this is basically like 
a basic a spring system 
so u, u, means a displacement, 
location 
then, you, 
this one is acceleration position 
is proportion to force 
so this means that, 
displacement is proportional to 
force, applied to material 
so this is basically a spring 
you know, if you spring, more, move 
if you move more, po, 
force to putting back, gets larger 
so this is a basic 
governing equations, system 
you, we represent u, 
we assume oscillation, vibration motion 
is presented this one 
so, left side is amplitude field 
so amplitude is depending x 
this is a view, you see in right 
side window, you know, amplitude 
so amount vibration is 
dependent location 
part moves a lot, 
part doesnt move a lot 
so this is left side 
right side is sine wave, 
in oscillating motion 
we put this here 
so amplitude is positional, 
oscillation is depends time, 
yeah cyclic motion 
if you put here, 
swap equation beautify it, 
youll get 
this is standard 
eigen value problem 
you solve using standard 
matrix computation method 
solving this one, this w, stays 
directly associated frequency 
so solving this eigen value problem, 
youll get frequency 
this is sound we, we produce 
a result simulation 
so heres a summary 
so we presented metallophone design 
cons, concurrent simulation 
audio feedback 
in, inside system we ran 
standard eigen mode analysis 
we assume cyclic motion, 
we tries to, to find frequency 
so to learn 
original paper is published 
designing custommade metallophone 
concurrent eigenanalysis 
if you want to know ay, 
analysis one possible reading is, 
dynamics structures 
this is old text book 
also sound rendering 
so simulation sound produced, 
production 
sound synthesis sound propagation is 
also hot topic in computer graphics field 
so called sound rendering 
one interesting paper 
to read is recent one, 
is precomputed acoustic transfer 
outputsensitive, accurate 
sound generation 
geometrically complex vibration 
so, recommended readings, 
if you want to know 
thank you
