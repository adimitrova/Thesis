last topic this 
week is a glider design 
so work we here, we introduce here 
is a teromis, an interactive design 
optimization free form, 
free flight model airplanes 
you see, this is a latest work 
so motivation question we here 
is to design a paper airplane 
glider so you could fly airplane, 
we hope flies well 
however, is easy 
inexperienced people to design 
a glider that flies well 
you know, there many designs, 
this is result many, 
many experimentation 
easy to design 
arbitrary shaped airplane 
so thats a problem we want to address 
again, we ran concurrent simulation, 
ran simulation to 
analyze well, 
we also provide automatic optimization 
so given current designs this model 
automatic adjusts shape so 
that flies well 
so, this is similar to 
previous system 
behind scene is interesting 
here, we use a data driven approach 
simulation 
so accurate analytic simulation 
airflow is difficult 
so here, we use many, many measured data 
so this is airplanes, 
we actually fabricated, created, 
flew together measured 
we get this loads data 
we infer many parameters 
we use 
physical analysis 
so thats story 
so let show you we 
yeah, so this is a typical 
example flying airplane 
so if you design arbitrary wing shape, 
you know, drops, doesnt fly 
so goal is to able 
to design arbitrary shape, 
this kind strange shape 
airplane that flies 
this is one example we 
created flies well 
so, approach is like this 
so first is offline precomputation 
so we took many, 
many airplane trajectories analyze 
so we flew gliders, check 
trajectory, flight trajectory 
we compare simulation result, 
adjust parameters so 
that simulation result fits 
well actual flight 
this is basis 
physical analysis 
given this data, you generate, 
you design airplane, 
system predict 
soft flight trajectory 
the, in addition to showing 
predicting flight trajectory set 
system runs automatic 
optimization to make flyable 
so user pause 
edit, edit simulation inaudible 
you get desired shape 
so this is user interface 
so similarly, to previous system 
we use edit to shape this kind 
two dimensional view 
so youre moving along vertices, 
system continuously 
change d shape 
in addition to that, here, 
bottom half is simulation result 
so this predicts happens 
in this case, airplane goes upwards, 
inaudible goes 
user edits a shape, system 
continuously runs physical simulation, 
tells whether airplane flies well 

reason, we multiple 
trajectories is that, you know, 
users hand throw always changes 
sometimes goes higher 
sometimes goes lower 
so system automatically predict, 
consider multiple possibilities, 
show general tendencies 
so thats a inaudible 
let describe 
optimization part 
so you see, 
there is a magic make fly button 
so this is you press this button, 
system apprised automatic optimization, 
to make this airplane fly 
so here, in this design, doesnt 
fly well, doesnt pass this line 
goes 
doesnt fly well 
soon you press this button, 
system optimizer, say carefully, 
kind subtle 
i not, nothing 
video, shows system 
automatically adjust wing position 
so, lets see 
user press this button, 
system adjust wing position 
yeah, here 
so, front wing moved sideways, 
so this is user, 
system automatically adjusts 
shape so that flies well 
so in this clip, 
user edits front wing 
system automatically adjusts 
position orientation rear wing 
so you see, user, 
moves around front wing 
system automatically adjust, 
rear wing 
please note that simulation results 
inaudible drastically changes 
small change in 
reorientation position 
is difficult to 
user, people to it, 
system 
sound so important part is 
this kind interactive exploration 
you test many different things 
system continuously provide feedback 
design, 
you send data to laser cutter, 
you get a shape 
results 
so, heres results 
so important thing is 
really flies well 
you know, kind amazing us 
so this a launcher 
starting 
you see, yeah, flies way back, 
so amazing 
yeah, we here 
this dragon airplane, this also flies 
you also use materials 
this one 
this one 
okay 
thats video 
so, heres a summary 
algorithm that we use 
so, standard fluid simulation 
aerodynamics is slow 
not, a real time 
so we use a traditional wing theory 
wing theory is simplified 
model airplane 
so computes lift force occurring 
wing, computing lift 
force gravity others, 
you predict flight trajectory 
so thats theory we use 
so wing theory looks like this 
so given given a, a wing, 
shape, force 
we compute, force up, close wing 
so lift force, f, 
drag force, fd, 
rotation force in tau, tau 
a function velocity 
area, you know 
faster faster forces 
gets bigger, area is bigger, 
forces gets bigger 
question is parameters 
you know, constant 
defines behavior wing 
depends angle attack 
also depends shape wing 
parameters are, 
is we want to know 
so to estimate this parameter, we take 
data driven parameterization approach 
so we fly many airplanes 
measure parameters 
we try to fit parameters 
so, you know, this cd, cl, cm, 
depending angle attack 
we plot in a measure, 
we plot measured data in space 
we get best approximation 
also we then, 
we estimate force caused 
wing element in this way 
we aggregate forces caused 
small wing elements 
we computes approximate total 
force caused total entire wing 
so to learn original paper is 
published interactive design 
optimization freeformed 
freeflight model airplanes in 
flight simulation is also 
discussed in graphics community 
one example is datadriven 
controllable flapping flight 
so simulates flapping 
flight birds 
datadriven simulation 
is also a popular topic 
so you, is opens a case slow 
to land, stand a simulation 
so possible approach is to allow many, 
many simulations beforehand flying 
in a long time assemble, 
measure previous simulation 
result to get a realistic result 
one possible reading is 
datadriven simulation methods in 
computer graphics is published 
a a siggraph course material 
so this is a summary this week 
so we presented integration 
real time physics modeling 
so user continuously aid to save, 
system continuously provides 
feedback, running physical simulation 
systems, provides 
inaudible simulation results 
but, also system provides continuous 
guidance to design varied shapes 
so we introduce a fast, 
simple cantilever design, 
also design, discuss musical 
instruments model analysis 
also also garment design, 
using linear approximation 
furniture design active guidance 
using joint force analysis, 
finally glider design using wing theory 
data driven parameter feeding 
so, thats end this video 
thank you
