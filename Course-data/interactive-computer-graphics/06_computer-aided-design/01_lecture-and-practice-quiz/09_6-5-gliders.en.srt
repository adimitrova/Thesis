1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,820
The last topic of this
week is a glider design.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,840
So the work we here, we introduce here
is a teromis, an interactive design and

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,630
optimization of free form,
free flight model airplanes.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,700
As you see, this is a very latest work.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,480
So motivation the question we here
is how to design a paper airplane or

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,490
glider so you could fly the airplane,
and then we hope it flies well.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,480
However, it is not very easy for

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,470
inexperienced people to design
a glider that flies well.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,380
You know, there are many designs, but

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,080
this is the result of many,
many experimentation.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,410
It's not easy to design
arbitrary shaped airplane.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,900
So that's a problem we want to address.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,090
And again, we ran concurrent simulation,
but not only ran simulation to

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,010
analyze it with as well,
we also provide automatic optimization.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,185
So given current designs this model
automatic adjusts the shape so

16
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,990
that it flies well.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,700
So, this is similar to
the previous system.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,320
Behind the scene is more interesting.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,490
Here, we use a data driven approach for
the simulation.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,770
So accurate analytic simulation
of airflow is very difficult.

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,060
So here, we use many, many measured data.

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,580
So this is airplanes,
we actually fabricated, created,

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,380
flew together and measured.

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,990
We get this loads of data and
we infer many parameters.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,200
And then we use it for
the physical analysis.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,940
So that's the story.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,630
So let me show you what we do.

28
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:38,610
Yeah, so this is a typical
example of not flying airplane.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,110
So if you design arbitrary wing shape,
you know, it just drops, doesn't fly.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So our goal is to be able
to design arbitrary shape,

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,270
this kind of strange shape
airplane by yourself that flies.

32
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,506
And then this is one example we
created and it flies very well.

33
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:06,780
So, our approach is like this.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,780
So first is offline precomputation.

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,530
So we took many,
many airplane trajectories and analyze it.

36
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,170
So we flew these gliders, and then check
the trajectory, flight trajectory.

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,440
And then we compare the simulation result,
and then adjust the parameters so

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,290
that simulation result fits
well with actual flight.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,775
And this is the basis of
the physical analysis.

40
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:40,770
And given this data, now you generate,
you design your own airplane, and

41
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,760
the system now can predict
soft flight trajectory.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,120
On the, in addition to showing or
predicting the flight trajectory the set

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,560
system runs automatic
optimization to make it flyable.

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,873
So the user can pause for

45
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:02,210
edit, edit and simulation [INAUDIBLE] and
then you get desired shape.

46
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,880
So this is our user interface.

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,090
So similarly, to the previous system
we use our edit to shape this kind of

48
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,410
two dimensional view.

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,640
So you're moving along the vertices, and

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,370
then system continuously
change the 3D shape.

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,610
In addition to that, here,
the bottom half is the simulation result.

52
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,520
So this predicts what happens.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,240
In this case, the airplane goes upwards,
and the [INAUDIBLE] goes down.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,010
And as user edits a shape, system
continuously runs physical simulation, and

55
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,197
tells whether the airplane flies well or
not.

56
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:38,430
The reason, why we have multiple
trajectories is that, you know,

57
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,440
the user's hand throw always changes.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,170
Sometimes goes higher.

59
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,580
Sometimes goes lower.

60
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,916
So the system automatically predict,
consider multiple possibilities, and

61
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,932
then show general tendencies.

62
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,146
So that's a [INAUDIBLE].

63
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:01,000
And now let me describe
the optimization part.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,660
So as you see,
there is a magic make it fly button.

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,110
So this is where you press this button,

66
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,590
system apprised automatic optimization,
and to make this airplane fly.

67
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,520
So here, in this design, it doesn't
fly well, it doesn't pass this line.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,870
It goes too up or too down or
it doesn't fly well.

69
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,312
As soon as you press this button,

70
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:24,900
system optimizer, say it carefully,
it's kind of very subtle.

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,730
But I do not, nothing.

72
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,850
The video, shows the system
automatically adjust the wing position.

73
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,662
So, let's see.

74
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:35,120
The user press this button,
system adjust the wing position.

75
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,849
Yeah, here.

76
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,827
So, the front wing moved sideways,
so this is not by the user,

77
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,050
the system automatically adjusts
the shape so that it flies well.

78
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,980
So in this clip,
the user edits the front wing and

79
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,799
the system automatically adjusts the
position and orientation of the rear wing.

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,460
So as you see, user,
moves around the front wing and

81
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,770
then system automatically adjust,
the rear wing.

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,430
Please note that simulation results
[INAUDIBLE] drastically changes with

83
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,830
just small change in
the reorientation of the position.

84
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,465
Which is very difficult to do for
the user, or people to do it, but

85
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,366
the system can do it.

86
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,541
[SOUND] So again the important part is

87
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:35,726
this kind of interactive exploration.

88
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:42,333
You can test many different things and
the system continuously provide feedback.

89
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,987
After having the design,
you send the data to the laser cutter, and

90
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,467
then you get a shape.

91
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,240
And results.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
So, here's our results.

93
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,810
So important thing is
it really flies well.

94
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,850
You know, it's kind of amazing for us too.

95
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,190
So this has a launcher and
they are starting from

96
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:13,990
As you see, yeah, it flies way back,
so it's very amazing.

97
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah, we have it here.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,548
This dragon airplane, and this also flies.

99
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,168
You can also use other materials.

100
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:47,103
And this one.

101
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,306
Or this one.

102
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:55,250
Okay.

103
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,790
That's the video.

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,620
So, here's a summary of
the algorithm that we use.

105
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,870
So, standard fluid simulation
aerodynamics is too slow.

106
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,060
It's not, can be a real time.

107
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,320
So we use a traditional wing theory.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Wing theory is simplified
model of our airplane.

109
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,840
So it computes lift force occurring each
wing, and then after computing the lift

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,240
force and gravity and others, and then
you can predict the flight trajectory.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,740
So that's the theory we use.

112
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,960
So wing theory looks like this.

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,130
So given given a, a wing,
shape, and then the force.

114
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,410
We compute, force up, close by the wing.

115
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,722
So it's the lift force, f,
and the drag force, fd, and

116
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,734
then rotation force in tau, tau.

117
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:51,074
And then it's a function of velocity and
area, you know.

118
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:55,196
It's faster and faster and then forces
gets bigger, and the area is bigger, and

119
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,270
the forces gets bigger.

120
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,990
And the question is these parameters.

121
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,250
You know, these are the constant.

122
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,060
Defines the behavior of the wing.

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,870
And it depends on the angle of attack and
also depends on the shape of the wing.

124
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,285
And these parameters are,
is what we want to know.

125
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:15,550
So to estimate this parameter, we take our
data driven parameterization approach.

126
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,130
So we fly many airplanes and

127
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,740
then measure the parameters and
then we try to fit the parameters.

128
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,570
So, you know, this Cd, Cl, Cm,
are all depending on the angle of attack.

129
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,210
And then we plot it in a measure,
we plot the measured data in the space and

130
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,270
then we get the best approximation.

131
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,080
And also we then,

132
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,700
we can estimate the force caused
by each wing element in this way.

133
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,140
And then we aggregate forces caused
by these small wing elements.

134
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,500
And then we computes approximate total
force caused by the total entire wing.

135
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,230
So to learn more the original paper is
published as Interactive Design and

136
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,050
Optimization of Free-Formed
Free-Flight Model Airplanes in 2014.

137
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,120
And flight simulation is also
discussed in graphics community.

138
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,491
One example is data-driven
controllable flapping flight.

139
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,940
So it simulates the flapping
flight of birds.

140
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,370
And data-driven simulation
is also a popular topic.

141
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,510
So you, it is opens a case too slow
to land, stand out a simulation.

142
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,000
So possible approach is to allow many,
many simulations beforehand of flying.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,031
And then in a long time just assemble,

144
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:45,140
measure previous simulation
result to get a realistic result.

145
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,430
And one possible reading is
Data-driven simulation methods in

146
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,230
computer graphics is published as
a a Siggraph 12 course material.

147
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,990
So this is a summary of this week.

148
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,230
So we presented integration of
real time physics into modeling.

149
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,279
So user continuously aid it to save, and

150
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,900
then system continuously provides
feedback, running physical simulation.

151
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,609
On some systems, just provides
[INAUDIBLE] simulation results.

152
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:18,839
But, also some system provides continuous
guidance to design varied shapes.

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,277
So we introduce a fast,
simple cantilever design, and

154
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:29,500
also design, discuss musical
instruments with model analysis.

155
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,530
Also also garment design,
using linear approximation and

156
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,235
furniture design with active guidance
using joint force analysis, and

157
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:43,830
finally glider design using wing theory
with data driven parameter feeding.

158
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,690
So, that's the end of this video.

159
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,190
Thank you
