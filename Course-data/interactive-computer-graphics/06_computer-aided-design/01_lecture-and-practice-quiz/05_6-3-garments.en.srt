1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,310
Our next topic is Garment design.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,370
The work we introduce here
is sensitive couture for

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,430
interactive garment editing and modeling.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,070
So, the problem we want to address here,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,620
is a design of a new
novel original garment.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,660
And again, this is very difficult for
inexperienced people.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,038
So, you have 2D cross pattern,

8
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:26,780
and then you have three
dimensional garment on the body.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,160
it's, what you want is
three dimensional shape.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,060
But what you have to control
is two dimensional shape.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,288
And it's very difficult to imagine
what 2D pattern you have to

12
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,852
get to get the desired 3D shape.

13
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,690
So, that's a problem we what to address.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,050
And our approach is the same
as the previous one.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,100
So we learn continuous concurrent
simulation behind the scene.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,591
So user continuously edits are saved
2D pattern with mass operation and

17
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:57,675
the system continuously applies
physical draping across simulation.

18
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:02,146
So user can directly edit to decide
while watching the clothing in

19
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,861
the 3D configuration.

20
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:11,714
Well, that's

21
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:17,160
the idea.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,325
So the same as before, on the left side,

23
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:22,022
you see 2D clothes patterns
the user is editing.

24
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:29,550
And on the ride si, on the right side you
see clothing, putting onto the 3D body.

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,380
And here the simulation is much more
accurate than the one I showed for

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,680
the stuffed animal design.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,160
So you can actually predict details,
wrinkles and so on.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,780
So you can interactively
edit the 2D pattern.

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,180
And the system interactively updates
clothing draping simulation results.

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,420
So you can actually see
some more wrinkles here.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,650
And then you can edit the shape.

32
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,785
So as to reduce wrinkles if necessary.

33
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:16,406
So traditionally, if you want to do this,
you have to actually physically cut paper

34
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:21,450
or a cloth material, stitch together and
put on the mannequin, physical mannequin.

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,645
And learn draping and see the result and
then go back to the pattern and

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,710
cut it again.

37
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,106
It can be very, very long,
long time, it's very slow.

38
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:33,040
And those are computer based
simulations also available.

39
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
It's similar.

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,050
You have to move the simulation engine
simulation and then go back to the design.

41
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,320
That's a problem.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,990
And also, technically, it's very,

43
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,040
challenge to run physical simulations so
rapidly.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,920
Of course there are real time rapid
cloth simulation existing already.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,228
But they, these physical simulation is for
animation.

46
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:57,570
So they assume fixed clothes pattern.

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,080
So clothes geometry doesn't change.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,855
And the system learns lots
of precomputation for

49
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,028
efficient computation real-time.

50
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:07,610
And then just draping learn animation.

51
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,840
To learn simulation to create animation.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,080
However, here, the system, the user
continuously change the rest of shape.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,840
Which is,
violates assumption of standard animation,

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,487
animation simulation [INAUDIBLE] so
that's a challenge we have to address.

55
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:36,916
So if you do not like a wrinkle here, then
you can just interactively add dart here.

56
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:43,125
And then, you can immediately see how
the resulting clothing looks more natural.

57
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:52,880
Okay, so this is one example and
here's more examples.

58
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,000
So, yeah, so design of t-shirt or

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,840
garment for human character
is not actually so difficult.

60
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,270
There are many standard
ways to design a garment.

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,910
However, if you want
to design a pajama for

62
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,970
armadillo like here,
it's a different program.

63
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,620
No one knows how to
design a character shirt.

64
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,430
And especially if you wanted to
buy a physically bodied garment,

65
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,390
it's very difficult, and this kind of
design tool can be very, very useful.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,340
So previously in computer graphics,
garment of this character is

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,820
a very cross mesh, there's no physics,
just a polynomial mesh.

68
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,650
But recently, game engines are very fast,
more efficient.

69
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,970
So we use, people starting to use
physical assimilation for these garments.

70
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,960
Now then, it's necessary to
design physical bodied garments.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,807
So that's these are why you
need this kind of tools.

72
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,610
So here is a comparison with a real one.

73
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,470
The left side is a computer graphics
view in your simulation, and

74
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,524
the right hand side is the physical
construction which we 3D printed.

75
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:11,760
This kind of character and also we
physically stitched together this garment.

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,740
And as you see, of course,
it is not 100 millimeter size exact match.

77
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,400
However, you see the general
pattern like sleeve folds here and

78
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,480
then you see full sleeve folds here.

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,160
So I think this is enough for
our initial design.

80
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,560
And we also design real
size garments using system.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,610
So this is just, just screen snapshot.

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,280
We're using track to edit to save.

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,643
And then you see continuously
see the 3D result.

84
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:02,195
And then we print it into a larger format,
real size print.

85
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,269
And then you put pattern into a cross and

86
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,940
you stitch it together and
then you get a wearable results.

87
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,570
Okay.

88
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,190
So let me briefly describe algorithm.

89
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,490
So, again, so oh, complete implementation
is beyond the scope of this short video.

90
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,250
But I can briefly describe
the basic idea behind it.

91
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,070
How to make it faster.

92
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,870
So this is a fundamental equation.

93
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,510
Mathematical representation of
the problem we trying solve here.

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,940
So we have 2D input pattern.

95
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,380
This is the input from the user.

96
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,110
So user specify 2D clothes pattern.

97
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,730
And then what we,
ha want to compute is 3D cloth shape.

98
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,470
So, yeah.

99
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,250
So input these XY coordinate positions or
we input clothes, and

100
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,460
the output is XYZ position or or
when you give your body shape.

101
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,940
So 3D cloth shape,
this is output you want to get.

102
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,187
And then we cover function,
that represents an additional set

103
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:17,436
of 2D cloth pattern input and
3D cloth shape output.

104
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,568
And this function returns 0,

105
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:23,430
if it is satisfy the physicality,
body natural shape.

106
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,820
And this function is called the resi,
residual.

107
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,630
So if the 3D cloth shape
is not in the desired,

108
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,000
appropriate physically balanced shape.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,525
This zero becomes bigger, larger.

110
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,880
And then we, we gradually,
this residual are smaller.

111
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,080
They get more physically
realistic results.

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,240
So that's the problem we try to solve.

113
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,090
And visually,
the situation looks like this.

114
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,460
So you have a space of varied designs.

115
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,470
And on this view,

116
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,570
on this axis, you have many different
two dimensional cloth patterns.

117
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,180
So use the space for
that starts from this pattern and

118
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,340
then moves to another pattern,
and use the edit.

119
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,535
And for each shape,
you have a single iso surface, or

120
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:11,240
space-specific region, where R becomes 0.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,159
So here, it's represented as
a single line, single cloth line.

122
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,688
So, for

123
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:21,842
the given 2D clothes pattern, we take
a look at the region where the R equals 0.

124
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:26,766
And then look at the 3D shape, and
then you will get the proper 3D output.

125
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:31,515
So this is a, very very simplified
view of what's going on internally.

126
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,786
The program is at, notice here.

127
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:40,857
So R, the residual is very highly
non-linear and very, very slow to compute.

128
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:45,850
So, yes, so R 0 is very curved and
very complicated.

129
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,520
When you change the pattern, you have to
recompute R, which takes too much time.

130
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,240
So we,
what we use is a kind of a stanadard.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,340
But we use a linear appro,
approximation around the current state.

132
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,910
So visually, it looks like this.

133
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:05,350
So, this a current design and
then you compute the linear appro,

134
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,440
approximation of this residual function.

135
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,330
And this method called, called sensitivity
analysis in structural analysis.

136
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,997
And then after computing linear
approximation it's kind of easy,

137
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:21,757
to predict the,
compute from 2D input to 3D shape.

138
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,290
Just by solving our linear system.

139
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,410
Which is faster.

140
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,420
Of course,
this is an approximation near this design.

141
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,240
So, if you go farther away,
then it's, it becomes too different.

142
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,570
So and your system.

143
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,690
So single linear
appropriate is nothing now.

144
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,340
Users who're walking far
away from the linear state.

145
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,899
It's a difference from the real
physically realistic result gets bigger.

146
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:50,480
So in that case, we compute another
approximation here right this way.

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,310
And then, so

148
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,800
we cache multiple linear approximations
occasionally and then blend them.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,620
So, in this case,
if you have two examples and

150
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,790
if you blend these two, you get a very,
very close approximation.

151
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,250
And this is still very fast to compute.

152
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,700
So that's what we do in internally.

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,750
So caching happens occasionally.

154
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,150
So, the user,
the system continuously monitors.

155
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,828
Users the dragging operation.

156
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:21,040
And then when the users dragging getting
far away, you create another cache.

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,421
Now you have two cache, and

158
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:26,279
you move far away from these two caches,
the system will generate another.

159
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:33,424
So in this way, the system incrementally,
the more and more caches.

160
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,820
So this is a summary.

161
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,624
So we presented garment design with
concurrent physical simulation.

162
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,353
So we edit a 2D pattern.

163
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:45,648
And the system presents
3D draping results.

164
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,614
And then we have uprising sensite,

165
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,898
sensiivity analysis which
is linear approximation.

166
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:54,416
And those are multiple caches
before providing rapid

167
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,630
feedback without random
simulation each time.

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,960
So, to learn more the original paper

Purely geometry approach, but

175
