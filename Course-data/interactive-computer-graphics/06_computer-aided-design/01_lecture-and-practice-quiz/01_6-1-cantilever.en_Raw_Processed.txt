sound hello this is week 
six interactive computer graphics 
topic well discuss 
here is computeraided design 
so, computeraided design is a process 
designing products using computers 
today, almost products 
designed using computers 
starting home electronics 
garments, cars, houses 
everything is designed using a computer 
physics, 
plays an important role in here, 
physics simulation is already 
heavily used in design 
however, in cases currently, 
physics analysis is done modeling 
so a user designers design a model 
modelers calibrate model 
that, model is 
transported physical simulation 
system, then, so people will analyze 
property like collision, friction, 
material property, gravity so 
if theres a problem, 
go back to design 
so, this is useful 
testing validity afterwards, 
this is good actively 
use physics design process 
so we try to here, is to integrate 
realtime physics modeling 
so, so currently d model ignore physics 
specify x, y, z coordinates 
shapes, 
here in system we introduce here 
integrates, d physical 
assimilation modeling process, so 
user generates a model, physical 
assimilation automatically checks 
validity provides feedbacks 
so thats basic idea 
we will show a couple 
example systems here 
so, this is a list topics 
discussing this week 
so one is cantilever design 
architecture 
design music inaudible 
noble musical instruments 
garment design, furniture design 
finally hobby glider design 
so first one is cantilever design 
so this one is called responsive fem, 
finite element method, 
aiding interactive geometric modeling 
so program we want today, 
discuss here is design a, 
physical physical constraint 
here, an example is 
a cantilever design 
suppose you a vertical wall here 
a horizontal 
steel bar attached to wall 
so originally, 
steel bar is connected vertically com, 
completely horizontally, 
perpendicular to wall 
construction, 
if you release hand, 
support material, 
gravity pulls steel downwards 
so, this is course exaggerated 
in reality, 
theres always a deformation 
so goal is to find shape that di, 
ended in a completely flat horizontal 
shape, applying gravity 
so this is kind 
difficult inverse problem 
a traditional approach is to run 
physical simulation modeling 
so, use a space rest shape 
physical simulation 
predicts happens 
looking result, user go back to 
design phrase, adjusts shape 
go to a simulation 
this kind back 
forth interaction is efficient 
so we propose is to run physical 
simulation modeling, specifically, 
while user is dragging one one 
system continuously 
provides feedback 
this way, you know 
to release dragging 
so let show you a demonstration 
so here is a demonstration 
so left side is original rest shape 
right side is gravity, 
is applied 
here, simulation is continuous, 
a user 
so this is so natural, so smooth, 
hard to see, hard to appreciate 
but, a user drags a system continuously 
physical simulation continuously 
presenting deformed shape, 
physical simulation, very, fast 
so a user change, position 
system continuously updates lines many, 
many simulations 
shows a simulation result 
so so fast 
so smooth, so user actually looking 
this simulation result, while dragging 
so simulation result is satisfactory, 
stop dragging, 
youll get desired result 
so, thats result, 
one that we use here is 
a standard finite element simulation 
so finite element simulation is to divide 
domain, shape small regions 
in this case triangle regions 
compute physical equations 
this matrix systems 
internally, this is a kind many, 
many internally 
essentially solves 
huge linear equations, 
actually handling matrices 
in order to accelerate this 
computation in this kind 
direct manipulation editing, 
we use, we use is here 
reusing intermediate 
computation results 
so, traditionally slow to hm, 
run this kind physi, 
simulation scratch each, frame 
in this example, 
in this modeling task, you know, 
you previous step 
simulation result 
compared to previous simulation 
result, inaudible a slight change, 
you know 
dragging single bar this, 
change is small 
so you reuse 
previous computation 
so thats a topic trick we use, we use 
now, this is a little bit details 
so, course possible 
to explain everything, 
we skipped exponential 
finite element measure 
a little bit complicated 
still, you get general idea 
so left hand side uses a coefficient 
matrix a, reconditioned matrix x 
so, we describe 
details ma, 
matrix structure we use in 
computation this simulation 
also, matrix a value list 
structure, body list, 
structure 
so information 
heavily used in system 
construction, 
this information is time consuming 
so in idle time, nothing happened, so 
we reuse old intermediate structure 
in dragging, we divided 
dragging depending distance 
dragging operation is small, 
small relocation, 
whats system is 
updates mashmish vertices 
almost information will used 
a user drags more, then, 
simple vertex relocation doesnt work, so 
system tries update, 
while finds a topology 
a while, if deformation 
still rise, simple relocation 
simple topology changes nothing there, 
so system re, 
reconstructs so this is is happening, 
behind scene, in this example 
internally, 
if relocation is small 
only, system only, 
recomputes a value list matrix a 
if you change topology, 
you to refresh coe, 
coef, coefficient matrix a 
you reuse 
precondition matrix b 
reconstruction 
everything is recomputed 
so this is equivalent to inaudible 
simulation scratch 
this happens rarely 
so this is a short section, 
summary is to introduce cantilever design 
concurrent physical simulation 
so you change shape while 
watching a simulation result 
internally, important point 
is that we apply multilevel reuse, 
intermediate computation result 
specifically internal large matrixes, 
matrices 
efficient computation 
so original paper is available 
responsive fem 
aiding interactive geometric modeling 
we discussed many 
examples there 
finite element method is an est, 
established method 
there many textbooks 
one example is this one, 
finite element method 
basis fundamentals 
structural optimization is often 
discussed in computer graphics 
one example is this one 
a procedure modeling structurally 
sound masonry buildings 
so this one is kind 
physics aware d modeling 
however, there is also 
automatic optimization, 
discuss interme bring 
feedback to end user manipulation 
thank you
