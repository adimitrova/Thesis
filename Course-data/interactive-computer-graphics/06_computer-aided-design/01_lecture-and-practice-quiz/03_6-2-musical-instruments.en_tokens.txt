okay
.
so
,
next
topic
is
,
the
design
of
novel
musical
instruments
,
like
a
metallophone
.
the
title
,
we
introduce
,
is
a
work
of
the
,
work
,
the
work
we
introduce
here
is
titled
designing
custom-made
metallophone
with
concurrent
eigenanalysis
.
so
the
problem
we
want
to
discuss
in
here
is
to
,
how
to
design
an
original
musical
instrument
.
so
,
we
pick
metallophone
,
in
this
project
.
and
as
you
see
,
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
proper
shape
that
produce
appropriate
sound
.
you
know
,
in
order
to
function
,
as
a
musical
instrument
,
they
need
to
produce
appropriate
sound
.
however
,
it
's
very
difficult
to
predict
what
sound
they
produce
when
they
're
hit
by
a
stick
.
you
know
?
so
that
's
a
very
,
again
,
very
difficult
constrained
design
problem
.
however
,
if
you
have
a
computer
,
computer
can
predict
the
sound
.
and
if
you
run
it
,
continuously
,
and
rapidly
,
it
can
be
fairly
useful
.
so
user
edits
the
shape
,
of
a
bar
,
of
a
metallophone
and
the
system
continuously
lands
physical
simulation
to
predict
the
feedback
or
audio
they
produce
,
the
tone
.
and
they
user
see
,
hear
the
sound
.
and
then
,
if
it
's
too
high
,
then
it
goes
back
to
previous
one
,
or
it
's
too
low
,
go
to
the
other
side
.
so
in
this
way
,
the
user
can
interactively
explore
,
a
body
shape
,
while
also
searching
for
aesthetically
pleasing
shape
.
so
that
's
the
idea
.
let
me
show
you
a
video
.
okay
,
so
here
is
a
video
.
in
this
example
,
the
to-
[
bleep
]
.
>
>
so
here
,
on
the
right
side
,
you
see
a
two
denominational
pattern
,
of
a
metallophone
you
are
designing
.
so
this
is
a
standard
,
editing
software
.
you
can
change
the
shape
by
dragging
.
and
on
the
right
side
you
see
that
the
simulation
is
out
.
just
visualize
what
happens
if
you
hit
this
metal
bar
,
with
your
stick
.
if
your
stake
is
a
bar
,
it
vibrates
and
it
produces
sound
,
and
this
is
a
visualization
of
vibration
.
of
course
,
this
is
exaggerated
,
but
you
see
the
result
.
and
then
,
in
addition
to
it
system
also
produce
a
sound
,
predicting
its
tone
,
or
pitch
.
so
user
can
hear
it
,
using
your
ears
.
so
while
hearing
your
sound
,
you
add
it
to
save
.
and
so
that
you
get
interesting
shape
.
but
also
satisfies
the
desire
of
a
sound
.
>
>
sound
of
a
metallophone
is
calculated
by
a
eigenvalue
analysis
[
bleep
]
.
as
the
user
edits
the
metallophone
shape
in
the
left
window
,
the
system
immediately
computes
it
's
eigenmode
.
show
in
the
right
window
,
which
tells
how
the
metallophone
oscillating
through
this
space
.
it
's
tone
is
also
updated
with
oral
feedback
using
beep
sounds
,
and
visual
feedback
in
the
status
bar
.
[
bleep
]
.
because
the
change
of
tone
caused
by
the
shape
addict
is
very
difficult
to
predict
,
we
believe
designing
a
metallophone
with
the
desire
shape
and
tone
will
be
possible
only
with
a
responsive
[
inaudible
]
.
>
>
so
,
by
the
way
,
this
visualization
is
actually
also
useful
when
you
,
physically
assemble
the
metallophone
.
you
know
metallophone
in
order
to
,
in
order
to
make
a
metallophone
you
have
to
put
this
bar
,
onto
the
base
.
however
,
it
's
a
question
as
to
where
to
fix
.
in
this
view
,
you
can
see
that
this
part
is
vibrate
a
lot
.
so
this
part
should
not
be
fixed
.
but
this
part
and
this
part
is
not
moving
at
all
,
so
this
is
a
good
place
to
place
it
down
.
[
bleep
]
.
>
>
here
are
,
the
designed
metallophone
pieces
by
an
artist
.
[
sound
]
.
and
it
's
actual
creation
.
[
sound
]
.
this
shows
that
our
analysis
successfully
simulates
the
real
world
.
[
sound
]
.
yeah
.
so
,
again
,
i
think
this
kind
of
design
's
very
,
very
difficult
with
assimilation
or
existing
measured
.
only
with
continuous
feedback
,
you
can
explore
many
possibilities
very
rapidly
,
and
you
can
design
this
kind
of
interesting
shape
,
with
appropriate
sound
.
so
yeah
,
in
other
words
,
we
,
we
briefly
describe
the
algorithm
.
again
,
we
use
finite
elements
simulation
,
so
we
do
not
go
to
the
details
.
but
i
can
give
you
an
,
a
basic
idea
.
so
the
problem
is
to
find
the
frequency
of
vibration
.
and
here
,
the
method
we
use
is
eigenmode
analysis
.
let
me
give
a
very
,
very
brief
abstract
explanation
.
so
this
a
equation
defining
this
phenomenon
.
so
,
this
is
basically
like
a
very
basic
a
spring
system
.
so
u
,
u
,
means
a
displacement
,
or
location
.
and
then
,
you
,
this
one
is
acceleration
or
the
position
.
which
which
is
proportion
to
the
force
.
so
this
means
that
,
the
displacement
is
proportional
to
the
force
,
applied
to
the
material
.
so
this
is
basically
the
same
as
a
spring
.
you
know
,
if
you
spring
,
more
,
move-
if
you
move
more
,
than
the
po
,
force
to
putting
back
,
it
gets
larger
.
so
this
is
a
very
basic
and
governing
equations
,
for
the
system
.
and
then
you
,
we
represent
u
,
we
assume
oscillation
,
vibration
motion
.
which
is
presented
as
this
one
.
so
,
left
side
is
amplitude
field
.
so
amplitude
is
depending
was
x.
this
is
a
view
,
you
see
in
the
right
side
of
the
window
,
you
know
,
amplitude
.
so
amount
of
vibration
is
dependent
on
the
location
.
some
part
moves
a
lot
,
some
part
does
n't
move
a
lot
.
so
this
is
the
left
side
.
on
the
right
side
is
just
sine
wave
,
in
oscillating
motion
.
and
we
put
this
into
here
.
so
amplitude
is
positional
,
and
oscillation
is
depends
on
time
,
and
very
yeah
cyclic
motion
.
and
then
if
you
put
it
here
,
and
then
swap
the
equation
and
beautify
it
,
you
'll
get
it
.
and
this
is
very
standard
eigen
value
problem
.
and
you
can
solve
using
standard
matrix
computation
method
.
and
after
solving
this
one
,
this
w
,
stays
directly
associated
with
the
frequency
.
so
after
solving
this
eigen
value
problem
,
you
'll
get
the
frequency
.
this
is
the
sound
we
,
we
produce
.
the
as
a
result
of
simulation
.
so
here
's
a
summary
.
so
we
presented
metallophone
design
with
cons
,
concurrent
simulation
and
audio
feedback
.
and
in
,
inside
the
system
we
ran
standard
eigen
mode
analysis
.
we
assume
cyclic
motion
,
and
then
we
tries
to
,
to
find
the
frequency
.
so
to
learn
more
.
original
paper
is
published
as
designing
custom-made
metallophone
with
concurrent
eigenanalysis
.
and
for
if
you
want
to
know
more
ay
,
analysis
one
possible
reading
is
,
dynamics
of
structures
.
this
is
old
text
book
.
and
also
sound
rendering
.
so
simulation
of
sound
produced
,
production
.
sound
synthesis
and
sound
propagation
is
also
hot
topic
in
computer
graphics
field
.
so
it
's
called
sound
rendering
.
and
one
interesting
paper
to
read
is
recent
one
,
is
precomputed
acoustic
transfer
.
output-sensitive
,
accurate
sound
generation
for
geometrically
complex
vibration
.
so
,
these
are
the
recommended
readings
,
if
you
want
to
know
more
.
thank
you
.
