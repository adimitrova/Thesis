the
last
topic
of
this
week
is
a
glider
design
.
so
the
work
we
here
,
we
introduce
here
is
a
teromis
,
an
interactive
design
and
optimization
of
free
form
,
free
flight
model
airplanes
.
as
you
see
,
this
is
a
very
latest
work
.
so
motivation
the
question
we
here
is
how
to
design
a
paper
airplane
or
glider
so
you
could
fly
the
airplane
,
and
then
we
hope
it
flies
well
.
however
,
it
is
not
very
easy
for
inexperienced
people
to
design
a
glider
that
flies
well
.
you
know
,
there
are
many
designs
,
but
this
is
the
result
of
many
,
many
experimentation
.
it
's
not
easy
to
design
arbitrary
shaped
airplane
.
so
that
's
a
problem
we
want
to
address
.
and
again
,
we
ran
concurrent
simulation
,
but
not
only
ran
simulation
to
analyze
it
with
as
well
,
we
also
provide
automatic
optimization
.
so
given
current
designs
this
model
automatic
adjusts
the
shape
so
that
it
flies
well
.
so
,
this
is
similar
to
the
previous
system
.
behind
the
scene
is
more
interesting
.
here
,
we
use
a
data
driven
approach
for
the
simulation
.
so
accurate
analytic
simulation
of
airflow
is
very
difficult
.
so
here
,
we
use
many
,
many
measured
data
.
so
this
is
airplanes
,
we
actually
fabricated
,
created
,
flew
together
and
measured
.
we
get
this
loads
of
data
and
we
infer
many
parameters
.
and
then
we
use
it
for
the
physical
analysis
.
so
that
's
the
story
.
so
let
me
show
you
what
we
do
.
yeah
,
so
this
is
a
typical
example
of
not
flying
airplane
.
so
if
you
design
arbitrary
wing
shape
,
you
know
,
it
just
drops
,
does
n't
fly
.
so
our
goal
is
to
be
able
to
design
arbitrary
shape
,
this
kind
of
strange
shape
airplane
by
yourself
that
flies
.
and
then
this
is
one
example
we
created
and
it
flies
very
well
.
so
,
our
approach
is
like
this
.
so
first
is
offline
precomputation
.
so
we
took
many
,
many
airplane
trajectories
and
analyze
it
.
so
we
flew
these
gliders
,
and
then
check
the
trajectory
,
flight
trajectory
.
and
then
we
compare
the
simulation
result
,
and
then
adjust
the
parameters
so
that
simulation
result
fits
well
with
actual
flight
.
and
this
is
the
basis
of
the
physical
analysis
.
and
given
this
data
,
now
you
generate
,
you
design
your
own
airplane
,
and
the
system
now
can
predict
soft
flight
trajectory
.
on
the
,
in
addition
to
showing
or
predicting
the
flight
trajectory
the
set
system
runs
automatic
optimization
to
make
it
flyable
.
so
the
user
can
pause
for
edit
,
edit
and
simulation
[
inaudible
]
and
then
you
get
desired
shape
.
so
this
is
our
user
interface
.
so
similarly
,
to
the
previous
system
we
use
our
edit
to
shape
this
kind
of
two
dimensional
view
.
so
you
're
moving
along
the
vertices
,
and
then
system
continuously
change
the
3d
shape
.
in
addition
to
that
,
here
,
the
bottom
half
is
the
simulation
result
.
so
this
predicts
what
happens
.
in
this
case
,
the
airplane
goes
upwards
,
and
the
[
inaudible
]
goes
down
.
and
as
user
edits
a
shape
,
system
continuously
runs
physical
simulation
,
and
tells
whether
the
airplane
flies
well
or
not
.
the
reason
,
why
we
have
multiple
trajectories
is
that
,
you
know
,
the
user
's
hand
throw
always
changes
.
sometimes
goes
higher
.
sometimes
goes
lower
.
so
the
system
automatically
predict
,
consider
multiple
possibilities
,
and
then
show
general
tendencies
.
so
that
's
a
[
inaudible
]
.
and
now
let
me
describe
the
optimization
part
.
so
as
you
see
,
there
is
a
magic
make
it
fly
button
.
so
this
is
where
you
press
this
button
,
system
apprised
automatic
optimization
,
and
to
make
this
airplane
fly
.
so
here
,
in
this
design
,
it
does
n't
fly
well
,
it
does
n't
pass
this
line
.
it
goes
too
up
or
too
down
or
it
does
n't
fly
well
.
as
soon
as
you
press
this
button
,
system
optimizer
,
say
it
carefully
,
it
's
kind
of
very
subtle
.
but
i
do
not
,
nothing
.
the
video
,
shows
the
system
automatically
adjust
the
wing
position
.
so
,
let
's
see
.
the
user
press
this
button
,
system
adjust
the
wing
position
.
yeah
,
here
.
so
,
the
front
wing
moved
sideways
,
so
this
is
not
by
the
user
,
the
system
automatically
adjusts
the
shape
so
that
it
flies
well
.
so
in
this
clip
,
the
user
edits
the
front
wing
and
the
system
automatically
adjusts
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
rear
wing
.
so
as
you
see
,
user
,
moves
around
the
front
wing
and
then
system
automatically
adjust
,
the
rear
wing
.
please
note
that
simulation
results
[
inaudible
]
drastically
changes
with
just
small
change
in
the
reorientation
of
the
position
.
which
is
very
difficult
to
do
for
the
user
,
or
people
to
do
it
,
but
the
system
can
do
it
.
[
sound
]
so
again
the
important
part
is
this
kind
of
interactive
exploration
.
you
can
test
many
different
things
and
the
system
continuously
provide
feedback
.
after
having
the
design
,
you
send
the
data
to
the
laser
cutter
,
and
then
you
get
a
shape
.
and
results
.
so
,
here
's
our
results
.
so
important
thing
is
it
really
flies
well
.
you
know
,
it
's
kind
of
amazing
for
us
too
.
so
this
has
a
launcher
and
they
are
starting
from
as
you
see
,
yeah
,
it
flies
way
back
,
so
it
's
very
amazing
.
yeah
,
we
have
it
here
.
this
dragon
airplane
,
and
this
also
flies
.
you
can
also
use
other
materials
.
and
this
one
.
or
this
one
.
okay
.
that
's
the
video
.
so
,
here
's
a
summary
of
the
algorithm
that
we
use
.
so
,
standard
fluid
simulation
aerodynamics
is
too
slow
.
it
's
not
,
can
be
a
real
time
.
so
we
use
a
traditional
wing
theory
.
wing
theory
is
simplified
model
of
our
airplane
.
so
it
computes
lift
force
occurring
each
wing
,
and
then
after
computing
the
lift
force
and
gravity
and
others
,
and
then
you
can
predict
the
flight
trajectory
.
so
that
's
the
theory
we
use
.
so
wing
theory
looks
like
this
.
so
given
given
a
,
a
wing
,
shape
,
and
then
the
force
.
we
compute
,
force
up
,
close
by
the
wing
.
so
it
's
the
lift
force
,
f
,
and
the
drag
force
,
fd
,
and
then
rotation
force
in
tau
,
tau
.
and
then
it
's
a
function
of
velocity
and
area
,
you
know
.
it
's
faster
and
faster
and
then
forces
gets
bigger
,
and
the
area
is
bigger
,
and
the
forces
gets
bigger
.
and
the
question
is
these
parameters
.
you
know
,
these
are
the
constant
.
defines
the
behavior
of
the
wing
.
and
it
depends
on
the
angle
of
attack
and
also
depends
on
the
shape
of
the
wing
.
and
these
parameters
are
,
is
what
we
want
to
know
.
so
to
estimate
this
parameter
,
we
take
our
data
driven
parameterization
approach
.
so
we
fly
many
airplanes
and
then
measure
the
parameters
and
then
we
try
to
fit
the
parameters
.
so
,
you
know
,
this
cd
,
cl
,
cm
,
are
all
depending
on
the
angle
of
attack
.
and
then
we
plot
it
in
a
measure
,
we
plot
the
measured
data
in
the
space
and
then
we
get
the
best
approximation
.
and
also
we
then
,
we
can
estimate
the
force
caused
by
each
wing
element
in
this
way
.
and
then
we
aggregate
forces
caused
by
these
small
wing
elements
.
and
then
we
computes
approximate
total
force
caused
by
the
total
entire
wing
.
so
to
learn
more
the
original
paper
is
published
as
interactive
design
and
optimization
of
free-formed
free-flight
model
airplanes
in
2014.
and
flight
simulation
is
also
discussed
in
graphics
community
.
one
example
is
data-driven
controllable
flapping
flight
.
so
it
simulates
the
flapping
flight
of
birds
.
and
data-driven
simulation
is
also
a
popular
topic
.
so
you
,
it
is
opens
a
case
too
slow
to
land
,
stand
out
a
simulation
.
so
possible
approach
is
to
allow
many
,
many
simulations
beforehand
of
flying
.
and
then
in
a
long
time
just
assemble
,
measure
previous
simulation
result
to
get
a
realistic
result
.
and
one
possible
reading
is
data-driven
simulation
methods
in
computer
graphics
is
published
as
a
a
siggraph
12
course
material
.
so
this
is
a
summary
of
this
week
.
so
we
presented
integration
of
real
time
physics
into
modeling
.
so
user
continuously
aid
it
to
save
,
and
then
system
continuously
provides
feedback
,
running
physical
simulation
.
on
some
systems
,
just
provides
[
inaudible
]
simulation
results
.
but
,
also
some
system
provides
continuous
guidance
to
design
varied
shapes
.
so
we
introduce
a
fast
,
simple
cantilever
design
,
and
also
design
,
discuss
musical
instruments
with
model
analysis
.
also
also
garment
design
,
using
linear
approximation
and
furniture
design
with
active
guidance
using
joint
force
analysis
,
and
finally
glider
design
using
wing
theory
with
data
driven
parameter
feeding
.
so
,
that
's
the
end
of
this
video
.
thank
you
