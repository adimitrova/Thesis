next topic is garment design 
work we introduce here 
is sensitive couture 
interactive garment editing modeling 
so, problem we want to address here, 
is a design a new 
novel original garment 
again, this is difficult 
inexperienced people 
so, you d cross pattern, 
you three 
dimensional garment body 
its, you want is 
three dimensional shape 
you to control 
is two dimensional shape 
difficult to imagine 
d pattern you to 
get to get desired d shape 
so, thats a problem we to address 
approach is 
previous one 
so we learn continuous concurrent 
simulation behind scene 
so user continuously edits saved 
d pattern mass operation 
system continuously applies 
physical draping across simulation 
so user directly edit to decide 
while watching clothing in 
d configuration 
well, thats 
idea 
so before, left side, 
you see d clothes patterns 
user is editing 
ride si, right side you 
see clothing, putting onto d body 
here simulation is much 
accurate one i showed 
stuffed animal design 
so you actually predict details, 
wrinkles so 
so you interactively 
edit d pattern 
system interactively updates 
clothing draping simulation results 
so you actually see 
wrinkles here 
you edit shape 
so to reduce wrinkles if necessary 
so traditionally, if you want to this, 
you to actually physically cut paper 
a cloth material, stitch together 
put mannequin, physical mannequin 
learn draping see result 
go back to pattern 
cut 
very, long, 
long time, slow 
computer based 
simulations also available 
similar 
you to move simulation engine 
simulation go back to design 
thats a problem 
also, technically, very, 
challenge to run physical simulations so 
rapidly 
course there real time rapid 
cloth simulation existing already 
they, physical simulation is 
animation 
so assume fixed clothes pattern 
so clothes geometry doesnt change 
system learns lots 
precomputation 
efficient computation realtime 
draping learn animation 
to learn simulation to create animation 
however, here, system, user 
continuously change rest shape 
is, 
violates assumption standard animation, 
animation simulation inaudible so 
thats a challenge we to address 
so if you like a wrinkle here, 
you interactively add dart here 
then, you immediately see 
resulting clothing looks natural 
okay, so this is one example 
heres examples 
so, yeah, so design tshirt 
garment human character 
is actually so difficult 
there many standard 
ways to design a garment 
however, if you want 
to design a pajama 
armadillo like here, 
a different program 
one knows to 
design a character shirt 
especially if you wanted to 
buy a physically bodied garment, 
difficult, this kind 
design tool very, useful 
so previously in computer graphics, 
garment this character is 
a cross mesh, theres physics, 
a polynomial mesh 
recently, game engines fast, 
efficient 
so we use, people starting to use 
physical assimilation garments 
then, necessary to 
design physical bodied garments 
so thats you 
need this kind tools 
so here is a comparison a real one 
left side is a computer graphics 
view in simulation, 
right hand side is physical 
construction we d printed 
this kind character also we 
physically stitched together this garment 
you see, course, 
is millimeter size exact match 
however, you see general 
pattern like sleeve folds here 
you see full sleeve folds here 
so i think this is enough 
initial design 
we also design real 
size garments using system 
so this is just, screen snapshot 
using track to edit to save 
you see continuously 
see d result 
we print a larger format, 
real size print 
you put pattern a cross 
you stitch together 
you get a wearable results 
okay 
so let briefly describe algorithm 
so, again, so oh, complete implementation 
is beyond scope this short video 
i briefly describe 
basic idea behind 
to make faster 
so this is a fundamental equation 
mathematical representation 
problem we trying solve here 
so we d input pattern 
this is input user 
so user specify d clothes pattern 
we, 
ha want to compute is d cloth shape 
so, yeah 
so input xy coordinate positions 
we input clothes, 
output is xyz position 
you give body shape 
so d cloth shape, 
this is output you want to get 
we cover function, 
that represents an additional set 
d cloth pattern input 
d cloth shape output 
this function returns , 
if is satisfy physicality, 
body natural shape 
this function is called resi, 
residual 
so if d cloth shape 
is in desired, 
appropriate physically balanced shape 
this zero becomes bigger, larger 
we, we gradually, 
this residual smaller 
get physically 
realistic results 
so thats problem we try to solve 
visually, 
situation looks like this 
so you a space varied designs 
this view, 
this axis, you many different 
two dimensional cloth patterns 
so use space 
that starts this pattern 
moves to another pattern, 
use edit 
shape, 
you a single iso surface, 
spacespecific region, r becomes 
so here, represented 
a single line, single cloth line 
so, 
given d clothes pattern, we take 
a look region r equals 
look d shape, 
you will get proper d output 
so this is a, simplified 
view whats going internally 
program is at, notice here 
so r, residual is highly 
nonlinear very, slow to compute 
so, yes, so r is curved 
complicated 
you change pattern, you to 
recompute r, takes much time 
so we, 
we use is a kind a stanadard 
we use a linear appro, 
approximation around current state 
so visually, looks like this 
so, this a current design 
you compute linear appro, 
approximation this residual function 
this method called, called sensitivity 
analysis in structural analysis 
computing linear 
approximation kind easy, 
to predict the, 
compute d input to d shape 
solving linear system 
is faster 
course, 
this is an approximation near this design 
so, if you go farther away, 
its, becomes different 
so system 
so single linear 
appropriate is nothing 
users whore walking far 
away linear state 
a difference real 
physically realistic result gets bigger 
so in that case, we compute another 
approximation here right this way 
then, so 
we cache multiple linear approximations 
occasionally blend 
so, in this case, 
if you two examples 
if you blend two, you get a very, 
close approximation 
this is still fast to compute 
so thats we in internally 
so caching happens occasionally 
so, user, 
system continuously monitors 
users dragging operation 
users dragging getting 
far away, you create another cache 
you two cache, 
you move far away two caches, 
system will generate another 
so in this way, system incrementally, 
caches 
so this is a summary 
so we presented garment design 
concurrent physical simulation 
so we edit a d pattern 
system presents 
d draping results 
we uprising sensite, 
sensiivity analysis 
is linear approximation 
multiple caches 
providing rapid 
feedback without random 
simulation time 
so, to learn original paper 
published sensitive couture 
interactive garment editing modeling 
garment design is also a hot, 
popular topic in graphics community 
one example is virtual garments, 
a fully geometric approach 
clothing design 
so, in this project, 
use physical simulation 
purely geometry approach, 
the, rapidly generate 
reasonable shapes this way 
thank you
