1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,350
Our next topic is Furniture Design.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,160
So the work we introduce here is a guided
exploration of physically valid shapes for

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,930
furniture design.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,000
So the motivation,
the question we want to address here is.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,240
How to design the valid furniture
like a shelf or a table.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,515
So the problem we consider
is robustness and stability.

7
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,060
Robustness means, means do not break.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,300
This one example, is you have this kind of
shelf and you put the heavy object here,

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,540
and this nail can be break, bent.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,050
So this is a problem we have to avoid and
also if you get this shape and

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,070
you put this heavy weight here,
then this would probably topple.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,690
So these are the problem we want to avoid.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,630
However, in this simple case it's
easy to see but if you have a very

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,420
complicated shape like this one, it's very
hard to see how to design valid furniture.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,930
So that's a problem we want addressed and
our approach is like previous

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,960
systems we introduced so far, we provide
continuous structure simulation.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,100
So given our user input,
system applied physical analysis and

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,960
they identify which is valid or invalid so
you can continuously be part of it.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,630
The addition to it in this work we
also provide active guidance to

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,880
maintain validity.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,910
So in addition just telling you,
you are invalid or you are valid.

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,690
System also guides the user
to recover validity.

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,700
For example,
if the user in this invalid region,

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,780
you are design is invalid and
not only telling that you are bad.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,210
It can also tell you how to fix it.

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,600
So the system is continuously provide
active feedback how to go back to

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,880
the valid region.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,180
So this is can be farther assist the user
in the design process, so that's the idea.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,360
And this is a special
technique we will introduce,

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,460
is one annotation indicating valid range.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,580
So here, in this angle,
is not very good, not durable.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,310
So, if you put weight here,
then this nail will be broken.

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,560
However, if you rotate this,
plank to vertical,

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,220
then it becomes stable,
robust, it doesn't break.

35
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,310
But if you go beyond farther then
again it's not robust, durable.

36
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,680
So system compute valid range of
the angle you are manipulating and

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,290
the visualizing another annotation so

38
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,600
internally system runs many simulations
and then finds the valid divisions.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,121
So this is the stability analysis and
annotation.

40
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,262
So the another is stability.

41
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:44,920
So here the system identifies that
this configuration is not stable.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,180
If you physically fabricate this,
this will topple.

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,100
So this is a [INAUDIBLE] but
in addition to providing this feedback,

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,920
system also provides suggestions
showing valid designs.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,540
So when the user provide this, not only
telling the user this is not stable,

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,360
the system generates body
candidates this way and

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,420
the user just speaks long them and
you get the product design.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,525
So let me show you a video.

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,372
[SOUND].

50
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:29,120
So, this is a user interface, so

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,920
user design the shape,
with a simple logging operations.

52
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:48,720
Yeah.
Nothing special so far.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,200
So here,
as a user start rotating this plank.

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,280
If the angle is too much,
then this joint will collapse.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
The system profile is
not durable feedback.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,450
In addition, this not durable indicator,
the system shows a valid lane.

57
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,722
So in this range it's okay.

58
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:14,700
Yeah, so this is a visualization.

59
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,710
So, this is much more helpful than
just telling you are not durable.

60
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,220
You can, the system also
provides visual of feedback.

61
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeah, this is the body domains for
preventing toppling

62
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,790
Our system also provides balance
in a number of positions.

63
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,641
If this is geometric analysis but if
it's not disconnected the system suggest

64
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:53,228
multiple choices to fix discontinuity And
here in

65
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:57,734
this situation it will topple, so system
suggest multiple candidates to fix it.

66
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,079
Yeah, in this case it's not durable so

67
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,301
systems suggested lower it,
remove the lower bar or other support.

68
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:53,670
Let me show you a little bit
more complicated example.

69
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,910
Yeah, so as the design gets more and more

70
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,740
complicated it's very hard to see where
is the bottle neck and what is a body.

71
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,323
But this kind of system very helpful to
design physically bodied complicated shape

72
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:09,179
like this one.

73
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:17,931
And then we also fabricated the L one so
in this case we designed a chair

74
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:29,009
[NOISE] Okay, so

75
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,920
let me again very briefly
describe what's going on inside.

76
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,010
So what we presenting is how to prevent
breaking and how to prevent toppling.

77
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,320
So first one is robustness analysis.

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,210
So if analyze bend force of joints.

79
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,622
And also in prevent toppling we put,

80
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:53,480
analyze force,
contact force at the ground.

81
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
So let me explain one by one.

82
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,110
So okay let's ask how to, let me just
clarify how to prevent breaking.

83
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,100
So, suppose we have this kind of
configuration, three planks and two nails.

84
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,259
And then we try to find the region
where the nail is placed.

85
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,030
And then in,

86
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,670
to do this we consider a space spanned by,
nail joint bending forces.

87
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,110
So we compute bending force
at this nail 1 on nail 2,

88
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,100
and then we put designs,
in the space spanned by these forces,

89
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,930
applied bending force
up right to these sets.

90
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,530
For example, in this configuration,
it is located here.

91
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,517
You know there's no,
if there's no bending force,

92
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:42,542
lambda 2 equal zero and
lambda 1 is somewhere here.

93
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:45,400
So this is the best thing,
so compute bending force and

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,090
then you put current design in this space
and after that we have bodied range.

95
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,560
Right, if the bending force is too light,
too large, it's not durable.

96
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,330
So bending force should be smaller
than a specific threshold.

97
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,092
And it is end up with
a kind of box region.

98
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:11,420
So if design is inside of this region
it's durable, it's safe, it's okay.

99
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,420
But if it's outside it's
not durable it's not okay.

100
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,840
So system needs to the suggest
going back to this region.

101
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,790
So yeah, so
value to design is somewhere here.

102
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,170
So the task is moving from here to there.

103
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,470
So that's the starting point and
then what we do is something like this.

104
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,850
So for our given current,
no spin, non durable design

105
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,840
we gradually change a parameter and
then we check the project tree.

106
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,270
You know, gradually change design and
then you rotate in this fourth space.

107
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,558
And then, you see a trajectory.

108
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:51,260
So if you change one thing,
you get this trajectory,

109
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,950
if you change another thing,
you will get another trajectory.

110
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,990
So in the system,
we test various trajectories, you know?

111
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,770
One point we try to change the angle here,
in somewhere else,

112
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,970
you try to position something else.

113
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,760
We try many different variety or
operations on the check trajectory.

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,220
And then, after checking trajectory,

115
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,040
we pick the one just going with the safe
region and then show it, as a result.

116
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,190
So internally, systems learns a lot
of physical simulation and we do not

117
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,460
explain data here, but internally we are
giving you the same sensitivity analysis.

118
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,530
So it is a linear approximation.

119
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,590
So instead of computing individual one,
we are approximating so

120
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:41,869
these linear single line then you can
arithmetically compute collision,

121
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,540
safe collision faster and
so that's what's going on.

122
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,550
Prevent toppling.

123
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,560
So this is also very similar.

124
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,770
So here we compute contact force between
the furniture leg and also the ground.

125
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,150
And this force should be in one direction,
you know, force should be.

126
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,450
And the action force comes
from floor to the furniture.

127
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,850
If the force is under the pointed side,

128
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,260
then it means that the for the floor and
it means that there is a problem.

129
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,220
So in the force space diagram
looks like this, so if.

130
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,500
So contact force should
be always positive.

131
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,860
You know?
Contact force needs,

132
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,745
needs to be positive, if negative,
it means that the contact becomes fall

133
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:34,810
apart; which means the furniture
topples over, stumbles.

134
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,800
So in, the task is to move the design
back into this valid region.

135
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,950
So again, the same thing.

136
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,055
You compute the trajectory by
checking many variations and

137
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,780
then to identify and find the good one.

138
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,170
Ok, so little bit, maybe too fast but
that's a brief summary.

139
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,450
So, we presented furniture design with
durability, and stability analysis.

140
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,360
So system continously checks whether
current design stable or durable.

141
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,580
And in addition to that,

142
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,510
system actively guide the user
to go back to the valid region.

143
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,690
So to do so, internally, we apply joint
force analysis in the force space.

144
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,260
So in the case of durability we compute
bending force and the force of stability

145
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,080
we compute the contact force and then we
try to move back into the safe region.

146
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,040
So to learn more, original paper was
published as Guided Exploration of

147
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,500
Physically Valid Shapes for
Furniture Design.

148
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,327
And the physically valid design
of objects is popular for

149
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:47,900
topic in this entry, and a couple of
interesting works appear in this entry.

150
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,200
And one is Make it stand: Balancing
shapes for 3D fabrication.

151
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,030
So this technique takes single 3D object
and then tries to adjust the shapes so

152
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,440
that it actually stands, not topple.

153
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,000
So this is automatic optimization and
the another is,

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,650
Stress relief: Improving structural
strength of 3D printable objects.

155
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,500
So this one takes 3D object and print it.

156
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,630
However it also analyzes weakest
bottle neck for example, this neck

157
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,430
can easily break, so system identifies it,
and then make it more stronger.

158
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,280
So this kind of condition
is heavily explored.

159
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,366
Our work is different because we try to
guide the user through the modeling phase.

160
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,801
That's it, thank you.
