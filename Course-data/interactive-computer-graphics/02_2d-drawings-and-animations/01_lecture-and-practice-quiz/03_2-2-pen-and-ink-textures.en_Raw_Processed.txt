next topic is pen ink restorations 
pen ink 
textures work we introduce here is 
titled vignette 
problem we want to address here is 
is tedious to draw detailed patterns, 
manually 
so if you want to draw kind 
patterns using 
pen, you to every details 
is tedious 
one possible approach is to copy 
paste, to repeat, 
generally repeated pattern 
repetition 
is visible looks unnatural 
so approach is to use example 
based texture synthesis technic published 
in 
so using this technique combining 
interaction technique, you 
draw this kind repeated pattern 
quickly efficiently 
let show you a video demo 
so, if you pick a standard pen 
this is a standard inking system 
however you also generate patterns 
like this way, 
so you suppose you draw this kind of, 
pattern 
you get this, you 
extend this way 
also this way, so i, identify 
pattern you draw many instances 
drawing 
blankaudio 
another example is this one, so you 
specify a region first, you draw 
patterns 
blankaudio 
a pattern, you 
repeat like 
this way you would get 
pattern automatically 
another interesting feature is like 
this, so you select a region 
you paint use elements, 
like this 
suppose you bricks in this way 
blankaudio 
maybe enough 
you get 
patterns like this way, that, 
you 
tilt it, like this kind d effect 
so this is, i, operation happens 
inside this region 
in this way, you get, kind 
three di, three dimensional effect, 
within region 
another possible operation is hatching 
so, you first select a region 
you draw example strokes like 
this 
way, this way this way, so 
you, select two 
you get this kind of, matching 
part 
you also draw in different 
directions 
youll get this kind hatching 
pattern easy 
so let show you a video 
so here, so you draw example sketches 
you draw a line 
system will automatically 
synthesize it, so pattern 
you repeat many times 
again, you paint an example, 
system requests 
desired path, system 
synthesizes stroke 
so in this way, i use 
paint many, many strokes, without drawing 
individual strokes 
important part here is 
seamless integration example 
generation, synthesis spot 
blankaudio 
heres another example 
so you, draw a few example, system 
synthesizes a list 
synthesis, you go back, 
to picture that i made 
you get, you add details 
automatically applied to 
synthesis result 
you also change density, 
also you change curve shape later 
blankaudio 
next part example is flood fill 
synthesis 
again, you draw a few elements, an 
example, system 
automatically synthesize, texture 
to fill region 
that, if you want, you 
change flow orientation, 
drawing strokes, picture will 
modified to flo, flow, to flow 
direction 
again, you change details 
later 
blankaudio 
heres an example hatching 
you draw a few e, e, examples, 
system predicts 
that, will auto provide three 
dimensional 
effect, you use a tilting tool, 
tilting tool, 
take, given two dimensional 
drawing you 
add, kind of, perspective effect, 
individual regions 
here is a couple example 
operations, so you paint this 
you get many, many hairs, 
sketching 
autofill useful 
background 
blankaudio 
and, here is result 
heres another example 
see, you draw examples then, fill 
region 
then, you use a perspective 
tilting to 
give a more, like, a three dimensional 
effect 
background painted using 
picture synthesis 
blankaudio 
now, here is result 
so thats video 
heres a couple results painted 
test users 
so you get this kind eh, sketches 

many, many repetitions using this kind 
automatic texture synthesis 
so this is one example this is 
another 
you get detail, detailed hairs 
detailed background hatching, 
so 
you also get this 
so i think d effect is used here 
here 
technique we did, use here is 
called discrete element texture synthesis 
so technique takes input layout, 
example layout 
automatically senses a new, 
larger layout 
automatically 
without explicit repetitions 
do, is basically, iter, 
iteratively refine 
lets start simple repetitions 
patch copy, repeated patterns 
gradually improves 
you finally get a beautiful 
result 
step we this 
so, step we repeat this 
so first, element in 
synthesized image 
element in synthesized image 
we look element in source 
image similar neighbor fill 
similar context 
so, suppose you an element here, 
you have, 
you know, circle bro, circle box 
in this arrangement 
you try to find similar 
arrangement 
so that a matching phase 
identifying a match, you 
compare context 
so this a synthesized context this is 
original context 
you compare two 
try to find ideal position the, 
surrounding object 
example, this box to 
left to similar to source 
so in this way, you compute ideal, 
ideal positions, target positions 
individual element 
pot, match 
individual element belongs to multiple 
matches 
we simply take average related 
ideal target positions 
move object to target 
position 
so repeating them, you will get 
this kind a result 
so starting simple multicopies 
youll get seamless patches 
okay so thats a brief description 
system called vignette 
original paper published a 
interactive 
texture designed migration freeform 
gestures penanink illustration 
technique we used is called 
element texture synthesis 
and, introduced in siggraph 
thank you
