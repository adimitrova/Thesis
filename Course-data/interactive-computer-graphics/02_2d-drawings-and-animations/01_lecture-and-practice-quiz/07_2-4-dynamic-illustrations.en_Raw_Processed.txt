next topic is dynamic illustrations 
work we introduce here, is 
called sketch based dynamic illustration 
fluid systems 
program we want to address here, 
is that is tedious to illustrate fluid 
flow 
suppose you a engineering system 
architecture 
organic shapes a liver system 
there is a lot fluid systems, you 
may want 
to describe fluid flow in 
kind systems 
you want to get kinds 
results 
tedious to draw 
manually 
so, idea is to use automatic flow 
simulation 
to automatically synthesize this kind 
data illustrations 
so here, simulation is used 
prediction, 
this is used a niche unknown 
illustration 
so let show you a video 
blankaudio 
so this is basically a drawing system 
you draw something, system 
continuously runs fluid simulation behind 
scenes 
add fluid flow visualizations 
automatically 
so you draw something, a region 
you draw pipes 
soon you finish drawing 
a system, system starts flow simulation 
behind scene 
so visualize a, a detail flow, also 
shows result fluid mixtures 
blankaudio 
so this tool is useful explaining 
fluid phenomenons 
blankaudio 
so you interactively edit shape 
deformation tools 
blankaudio 
okay 
so an, unknown example is here 
blankaudio 
so here we use two explaining 
surgical operations a defected heart 
so here is an example 
so here this heart specific 
configuration 
ideal 
here ideally blue blood come 
body, directly 
go to lung, lung, 
fresh blood, red 
blood comes heart, red 
one go body, 
however here blue blood is mixed together 
red one 
purple one go to body 
so, doctors will perform a surgical 
operation to fix this 
however, that, need to 
explain 
to patients, 
patients parents 
however, difficult to that 

standard tools, currently, use 
standard pen ink 
black white illustration to describe 
them, 
however, difficult to understand 

preparing this kind beautiful 
illustration using computer 
system, is time consuming, 
importantly, this kind 
heart disease different 
configuration patient, 
so possible to prepare a template 
hand 
so, this kind tool useful 
to explain understand complicated flow 
phenomenon 
let show you works 
so first, 
operation start connecting 
locations, 
will change configuration 
here 
so doctor cuts here connect 
so, soon configuration changes, 
fluid simulation changes flow, 
prediction 
blankaudio 
so next one is important one 
doctor stops here, cut here, 
connect here 
therefore, blood suddenly changes 
blankaudio 
finally, in closing this hole 
let blood directly go to body, 
red 
blankaudio 
this kind technique 
useful various 
fluid phenomena inside body, like 
blood circulation others 
blankaudio 
also this technique is, used 
engineering systems 
like this one 
blankaudio 
this is another example in unknown 
so you see 
cold air le warm air mix together 
flow 
you test many different 
configurations 
blankaudio 
this tool also used for, 
explanation pollution rivers, 
so 
so let describe 
region briefly 
so we use is a hybrid fluid 
simulation system 
so user draws global network local 
regions 
we apply different simulation 
unknown different scale 
single scale simulation 
slow 
so, a global network simulation, we 
use simple hydraulic simulation 
therefore, individual local region, we 
use hydrodynamic simulations 
so, to use a unknown node inflow, 
there forms 
a global network structure, hydraulics 
compute pipe flow 
node pressure, this node 
pipe flow node pressure, hydrodynamics 
computes a detailed, computes detailed 
flow, inside this region 
so this is a little bit in involved, 
let describe way 
first line is hydraulics simulation 
a global network 
here, input is node inflow qn, so much 
flow comes in node 
we compute is pipe flow 
node inflow 
hydraulics is a simplified 
computational method directly computed 
compute node inflow, to get 
a pipe flow 
pipe flow, we compute a 
pressure, pressure drop this pipe 
pipe pressure drop, we 
compute node pressure inside 
node 
you get information 
solving a linear global system 
fast efficient 
computing pressure node, 
unknown pipe flow, we 
switch to regional inaudible so 
local region 
we compute we divide a lots grid 
cells 
like this one, grade cell, we 
compute pressure 
velocity, in order compute 
individual pressure velocity, we 
use a standard established fluid 
equation called navierstokes equation 
so this one is a little bit complicated, 

essentially this explains 
relationship fluid velocity 
fluid pressure, you know, if theres a 
huge 
difference in fluid pressure, 
causes velocity, so 
this step basically solved this 
equation times 
step, time step this grid cells 
inside region, to get an animation 
so so original paper published 
sketch based dynamic illus, illustration 
fluid systems 
if you want to learn fluid 
animation, i recommend you to read 
text books 
one example is fluid simulation 
computer graphics bridson 
this work is an example 
illustrative animation facilitating 
understanding 
interesting early dated work 
is, mathpad, takes mathematical 
inaudible 
expression, automatically 
generates 
animation, based mathematical 
expression 
so thats, this is end 
second week this interactive computer 
graphics course 
we described dia, diagram beautification 
inaudible shape manipulation, 
also 
dynamic illustration a fluid 
simulation 
thank you
