our
next
topic
is
pen
and
ink
restorations
and
pen
and
ink
textures
and
the
work
we
introduce
here
is
titled
vignette
.
the
problem
we
want
to
address
here
is
it
is
tedious
to
draw
detailed
patterns
,
manually
.
so
if
you
want
to
draw
these
kind
of
patterns
using
your
pen
,
you
have
to
do
every
details
which
is
very
tedious
.
and
one
possible
approach
is
to
copy
and
paste
,
to
repeat
,
generally
repeated
pattern
but
the
repetition
is
visible
and
looks
too
unnatural
.
so
our
approach
is
to
use
example
based
texture
synthesis
technic
published
in
2011.
so
using
this
technique
and
combining
interaction
technique
,
you
can
draw
this
kind
of
repeated
pattern
very
quickly
and
efficiently
.
let
me
show
you
a
video
demo
.
so
,
if
you
pick
a
standard
pen
.
this
is
just
a
standard
inking
system
.
however
you
can
also
generate
patterns
like
this
way
,
so
you
suppose
you
can
draw
this
kind
of
,
pattern
.
and
then
after
you
get
this
,
you
can
extend
it
this
way
.
and
also
this
way
,
so
after
i
,
identify
pattern
you
can
draw
many
instances
just
by
drawing
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
another
example
is
this
one
,
so
you
specify
a
region
first
,
and
then
you
draw
patterns
.
[
blank_audio
]
then
after
having
a
pattern
,
you
can
repeat
it
like
this
way
and
then
you
would
just
get
pattern
automatically
.
and
another
interesting
feature
is
like
this
,
so
you
select
a
region
.
and
then
you
paint
and
use
your
elements
,
like
this
.
suppose
you
have
bricks
in
this
way
.
[
blank_audio
]
maybe
enough
.
and
then
you
can
get
.
patterns
like
this
way
,
and
after
that
,
you
can
tilt
it
,
like
this
kind
of
3d
effect
.
so
this
is
,
i
,
operation
only
happens
inside
this
region
.
but
in
this
way
,
you
can
get
,
kind
of
three
di
,
three
dimensional
effect
,
within
the
region
.
another
possible
operation
is
hatching
.
so
,
you
first
select
a
region
.
and
then
you
draw
example
strokes
like
this
way
,
this
way
and
this
way
,
and
so
on
.
and
then
you
,
select
these
two
.
and
then
you
get
this
kind
of
,
matching
part
of
it
.
and
then
you
can
also
draw
in
different
directions
and
then
you
'll
get
this
kind
of
hatching
pattern
very
easy
.
so
let
me
show
you
a
video
.
so
here
,
so
you
draw
example
sketches
and
then
you
draw
a
line
.
and
the
system
will
automatically
synthesize
it
,
so
it
's
same
pattern
.
and
you
can
repeat
it
many
times
.
and
again
,
you
paint
an
example
,
and
then
system
requests
the
desired
path
,
and
the
system
synthesizes
the
same
stroke
.
so
in
this
way
,
i
use
and
can
paint
many
,
many
strokes
,
without
drawing
individual
strokes
.
and
the
most
important
part
here
is
the
seamless
integration
of
example
generation
,
and
then
synthesis
spot
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
here
's
another
example
.
so
you
,
draw
a
few
example
,
and
the
system
synthesizes
a
list
.
and
after
the
synthesis
,
you
can
go
back
,
to
the
picture
that
i
made
.
you
can
get
,
you
can
add
more
details
and
these
are
automatically
applied
to
the
synthesis
result
.
and
you
can
also
change
the
density
,
and
also
you
can
change
the
curve
shape
later
.
[
blank_audio
]
the
next
part
example
is
flood
fill
synthesis
.
again
,
you
draw
a
very
few
elements
,
an
example
,
and
then
system
automatically
synthesize
,
the
same
texture
to
fill
the
region
.
and
after
that
,
if
you
want
,
you
can
change
the
flow
orientation
,
just
by
drawing
the
strokes
,
and
then
picture
will
be
modified
to
flo
,
flow
,
to
flow
direction
.
and
again
,
you
can
change
the
details
later
[
blank_audio
]
and
here
's
an
example
of
hatching
.
you
draw
a
few
e
,
e
,
examples
,
and
then
system
predicts
it
.
and
after
that
,
it
will
auto
provide
three
dimensional
effect
,
you
can
use
a
tilting
tool
,
tilting
tool
,
and
then
take
,
given
the
two
dimensional
drawing
you
can
add
,
kind
of
,
perspective
effect
,
for
individual
regions
.
and
here
is
a
couple
of
example
operations
,
so
you
paint
this
.
and
then
you
can
get
many
,
many
hairs
,
just
by
sketching
.
and
the
auto-fill
can
be
useful
for
the
background
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
,
here
is
the
result
.
here
's
another
example
.
see
,
you
draw
examples
and
then
,
fill
the
region
.
and
then
,
you
can
use
a
perspective
tilting
to
give
a
more
,
like
,
a
three
dimensional
effect
.
and
then
background
can
be
painted
using
the
picture
synthesis
.
[
blank_audio
]
now
,
here
is
the
result
.
so
that
's
our
video
.
and
here
's
a
couple
of
results
painted
by
test
users
.
so
you
can
get
this
kind
of
eh
,
sketches
with
many
,
many
repetitions
using
this
kind
of
automatic
texture
synthesis
.
so
this
is
one
example
and
this
is
another
.
you
can
get
detail
,
very
detailed
hairs
and
very
detailed
background
and
hatching
,
so
on
.
and
you
can
also
get
this
.
so
i
think
3d
effect
is
used
here
and
here
.
and
the
technique
we
did
,
use
here
is
called
discrete
element
texture
synthesis
.
and
so
their
technique
takes
input
layout
,
example
layout
.
and
then
it
automatically
senses
a
new
,
larger
layout
.
automatically
.
without
explicit
repetitions
.
and
what
they
do
,
is
basically
,
iter
,
iteratively
refine
it
.
let
's
start
with
just
simple
repetitions
.
patch
on
the
copy
,
repeated
patterns
.
but
gradually
improves
it
.
and
then
you
finally
get
a
very
beautiful
result
.
and
for
each
step
we
do
this
.
so
,
each
step
we
repeat
this
.
so
first
,
for
each
element
in
the
synthesized
image
.
for
each
element
in
the
synthesized
image
.
we
look
for
the
element
in
the
source
image
with
similar
neighbor
fill
or
similar
context
.
so
,
suppose
you
have
an
element
here
,
and
you
have
,
you
know
,
circle
and
bro
,
circle
and
box
in
this
arrangement
.
you
try
to
find
the
most
similar
arrangement
.
so
that
a
matching
phase
.
after
identifying
a
match
,
then
you
compare
the
context
.
so
this
a
synthesized
context
and
this
is
original
context
.
and
then
you
compare
these
two
and
then
try
to
find
ideal
position
for
the
,
surrounding
object
.
for
example
,
this
box
should
be
more
to
the
left
to
be
similar
to
the
source
.
so
in
this
way
,
you
compute
ideal
,
ideal
positions
,
or
target
positions
for
individual
element
.
for
each
pot
,
match
.
and
individual
element
belongs
to
multiple
matches
.
we
simply
take
average
of
all
the
related
ideal
or
target
positions
.
and
then
move
the
object
to
the
target
position
.
so
by
repeating
them
,
then
you
will
get
this
kind
of
a
result
.
so
starting
from
simple
multi-copies
.
and
then
you
'll
get
seamless
patches
.
okay
so
that
's
a
brief
description
of
the
system
called
vignette
.
our
original
paper
was
published
as
a
interactive
texture
designed
migration
with
freeform
gestures
for
pen-an-ink
illustration
.
and
the
technique
we
used
is
called
element
texture
synthesis
.
and
,
it
was
introduced
in
siggraph
of
thank
you
.
