hello, this is week two interactive 
computer graphics 
topic this week is, d drawings 
animations 
heres a list topics, we discuss in 
this week 
diagram beautification, penandink 
textures, 
shape manipulation, dynamic 
illustrations 
first one, is diagram beautification 
work we introduce here, is called 
pegasus 
problem we discuss here, is a 
drawing this kind geometric 
drawings, tedious to draw 
this kind diagram, using traditional 
drawing systems 
example, if you want to draw, this 
kind symmetric diagram, you to 
draw 
first half draw, draw half 
duplicate it, flip move 

so, you to combine three, two 
three commands to a symmetric drawing 
if you something like, like this, like 
symmetric, perpendicular, gap 
connect 
then, becomes difficult to 
it, combining appropriate commands 
so, we propose is to automatically, 

system automatically take care 
kind constraints 
here is demonstration 
so, this is designed pen 
computing 
so, you directly draw a line 
whiteboard, system 
automatically provides feedback 
so here, you draw a line, 
system automatically beautifies 
if you draw a line, system 
automatically beautifies 
so, this point is automatically aligned to 
this point 
you draw a line here 
system automatically beautifies 

if you a line here, this is almost 
perpendicular to slope 
system makes perfectly 
perpendicular 
so, in this way, you draw freeform 
lines 
you will get this kind 
diagram 
traditional, in, in traditional systems, 
you to draw rectangle 
separately move it, rotate, 
connect, so 
so, tedious 
here, you draw six lines 
system automatically beautifies 
you many things 
example, if you draw, almost symmetric 
line 
system makes it, perfect mirror image 
you draw three strokes 
youll get this diagram 
if you draw right here, this is 
identical, similar to 
previous one, assistant makes 
an exact copy, previous stroke 
so again, you draw three lines 
youll get, you will get a copy 
without 
using copy duplicate command we 
also provide equal distance between 
lines, so in this way, you get this 
wizard specifying 
grid, hand also, you 
something like this 
system automatically makes distance, 
between two lines identical 
so traditionally, you to draw two 
lines duplicate it, 
rotate trim it, so 
tedious 
one important aspect this kind 
automatic system is that, user input 
ambiguous 
so, if you draw a line here, this is 
ambiguous, right 
so, user may want to draw a mirror image 
here you 
may want to connect points user 
may want to this 
so, system automatically infers multiple 
candidates presents a user 
you choose one later, this 
is important to handle ambiguity 
thats beautification 
we also implemented a prediction in, 
in this system 
so, suppose, you this kind 
illustration already you draw a line 
here 
so, here, system knows that this red 
segment is identical to this one 
so, system automatically predicts 
infers that, that, you draw 
thing, you probably, want to draw 
thing around 
so, heres a prediction 
if you like one them, click 
it, next prediction appears 
so, long prediction is correct, 
you complete drawing 
successive clicking, if you 
prediction is use, 
useful, you ignore you 
draw 
yourself, you again, activate 
prediction click draw 
yeah 
this prediction is useful 
multiple purposes, like drawing 
repetitive illustration 
you click here 
type, touch, unknown segment, 
unknown 
so, this useful repetitive 
drawing 
this is also useful symmetric 
drawing like this one 
so, you tap, prediction 
appears 
tap, tap, tap 
you will get this kind 
symmetry doing, drawing 
prediction 
so, 
thats demonstration 
let briefly describe algorithm 
behind 
beautification algorithm 
prediction onwards 
so beautification, works this way 
so far, user input is this red one 
then, looking this input, system 
first first, learns constraint 
inference engine 
then, getting segment coordinates 
positions 
then, infer multiple constraints 
so, in this case, system infers that 
this connected, 
this perpendicular, this 
be, horizontally aligned so 
given this possible geometric constraints, 
constraint solver, 
tries to combine solve 
here 
an interesting point here, is that 
constraints be, contradictory 
features 
so, constraint solver needs to find valid 
combinations multiple 
candidate system, evaluate them, in 
is closer 
to user input pick more, 
plausible one 
a first candidate return to 
user 
let me, describe constraint 
solvability 
so, constraint solver, i said, takes 
multiple infer constraints, 
identified combination, 
returns result, 
combination 
and, details, let describe 
details using one example 
suppose you four constraints 
x equal , y equal , x minus y equal , x 
plus y equal 
so, suppose you four 
constraints 
tries to find valid combinations 
one combination, is one two 
so, if you combine two, you would 
get one two here 
if you combine this first third 
one, x 
equals , y equals you get this 
however, you cannot combine three 

contradictory, so thats we try to 
here 
in system, algorithm works 
follows 
constraint you apply, you make 
inaudible 
we a set intermediate valuations 
like 
this, so far valuation is given 
x first constraint, you apply 
apply 
so, if you apply thing 
if you apply it, you get one 
valuated 
so, in this way, you kind 
basically binary tree you sort 
intermediate valuations grows 
exponentially 
however, in cases 
variations 
example, this variation combining fast 
one this one, 
is identical to combining this one 
this one 
so, solutions merged together 
so, this is a kind thing happening 
behind consonant solver 
let briefly describe prediction 
algorithm 
prediction works follows, so you 
kind 
existing segments you get new 
input segments 
first, system searches identical 
segments, identical to new input 
segment 
identifying matched existing 
segment 
system collect, aggregate, nearby 
segment to different 
stroke copy to new, 
segment 
addition to that, we add vertical 
horizontal flip, predictions 
so, thats way, prediction work, 
works 
so, thats a,a system original 
paper published interactive 
beautification, a technique rapid 
geometric design in 
constraint based drawing, is a popular 
topic 
an original paper published 
sketchpad this is, 
a old paper published in , 
this is still 
powerful tool 
i recommend you to take a look 
video 
this a fast computer graphics 
also fast interactive computer 
graphics 
if you want to see recent one 
id recommend you to take a look 
cinderella system 
this is this kind constraintbased, 
geometric drawing system 
this is useful mathematical 
education so 
thank you
