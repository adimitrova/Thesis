00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,108
Our next topic is pen and ink restorations
and pen and ink

2
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:10,334
textures and the work we introduce here is
titled Vignette.

3
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:13,379
The problem we want to address here is

4
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:17,302
it is tedious to draw detailed patterns,
manually.

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,008
So if you want to draw these kind of
patterns using

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,450
your pen, you have to do every details
which is very tedious.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,210
And one possible approach is to copy and
paste, to repeat,

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,000
generally repeated pattern but the
repetition

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,619
is visible and looks too unnatural.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,909
So our approach is to use example

11
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,691
based texture synthesis technic published
in 2011.

12
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:45,202
So using this technique and combining
interaction technique, you can

13
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:49,726
draw this kind of repeated pattern very
quickly and efficiently.

14
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:53,469
Let me show you a video demo.

15
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,860
So, if you pick a standard pen.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,810
This is just a standard inking system.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,390
However you can also generate patterns
like this way,

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,100
so you suppose you can draw this kind of,
pattern.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,880
And then after you get this, you can
extend it this way.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,726
And also this way, so after i, identify

21
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:21,512
pattern you can draw many instances just
by drawing.

22
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:26,630
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,767
And another example is this one, so you

24
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:34,056
specify a region first, and then you draw
patterns.

25
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:44,528
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:48,711
Then after having a pattern, you can
repeat it like

27
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:53,270
this way and then you would just get
pattern automatically.

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,170
And another interesting feature is like
this, so you select a region.

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:06,853
And then you paint and use your elements,
like this.

30
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:10,168
Suppose you have bricks in this way.

31
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:15,687
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,743
Maybe enough.

33
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:20,271
And then you can get.

34
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:24,061
Patterns like this way, and after that,
you

35
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,670
can tilt it, like this kind of 3D effect.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,845
So this is, i, operation only happens
inside this region.

37
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:34,660
But in this way, you can get, kind

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,452
of three di, three dimensional effect,
within the region.

39
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:40,734
Another possible operation is hatching.

40
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:44,562
So, you first select a region.

41
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:49,970
And then you draw example strokes like
this

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,932
way, this way and this way, and so on.

43
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:56,991
And then you, select these two.

44
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:03,234
And then you get this kind of, matching
part of it.

45
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,965
And then you can also draw in different
directions and

46
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:11,016
then you'll get this kind of hatching
pattern very easy.

47
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,991
So let me show you a video.

48
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:22,790
So here, so you draw example sketches and
then you draw a line.

49
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,698
And the system will automatically
synthesize it, so it's same pattern.

50
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,930
And you can repeat it many times.

51
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,513
And again, you paint an example, and then
system requests

52
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:37,474
the desired path, and the system
synthesizes the same stroke.

53
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,052
So in this way, I use and can

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,980
paint many, many strokes, without drawing
individual strokes.

55
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,398
And the most important part here is the

56
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:50,990
seamless integration of example
generation, and then synthesis spot.

57
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,868
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,847
And here's another example.

59
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:03,960
So you, draw a few example, and the system
synthesizes a list.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,610
And after the synthesis, you can go back,
to the picture that I made.

61
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,700
You can get, you can add more details

62
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,300
and these are automatically applied to the
synthesis result.

63
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,667
And you can also change the density, and
also you can change the curve shape later.

64
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:34,343
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:37,120
The next part example is flood fill
synthesis.

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,341
Again, you draw a very few elements, an
example, and then system

67
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:47,950
automatically synthesize, the same texture
to fill the region.

68
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,641
And after that, if you want, you can
change the flow orientation, just by

69
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:59,020
drawing the strokes, and then picture will

70
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,140
be modified to flo, flow, to flow
direction.

71
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,937
And again, you can change the details
later

72
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:17,833
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,400
And here's an example of hatching.

74
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,820
You draw a few e, e, examples, and then
system predicts it.

75
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,732
And after that, it will auto provide three
dimensional

76
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:31,395
effect, you can use a tilting tool,
tilting tool,

77
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:35,474
and then take, given the two dimensional
drawing you

78
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:40,570
can add, kind of, perspective effect, for
individual regions.

79
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,020
And here is a couple of example
operations, so you paint this.

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:59,349
And then you can get many, many hairs,
just by sketching.

81
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,257
And the auto-fill can be useful for the
background.

82
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:14,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

83
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,239
And, here is the result.

84
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,487
Here's another example.

85
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:23,110
See, you draw examples and then, fill the
region.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,626
And then, you can use a perspective
tilting to

87
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:37,261
give a more, like, a three dimensional
effect.

88
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:42,195
And then background can be painted using
the picture synthesis.

89
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:53,081
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:57,208
Now, here is the result.

91
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,340
So that's our video.

92
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,340
And here's a couple of results painted by
test users.

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,210
So you can get this kind of eh, sketches
with

94
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,380
many, many repetitions using this kind of
automatic texture synthesis.

95
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,520
So this is one example and this is
another.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,357
You can get detail, very detailed hairs

97
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:21,039
and very detailed background and hatching,
so on.

98
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,661
And you can also get this.

99
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:28,660
So I think 3D effect is used here and
here.

100
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,340
And the technique we did, use here is
called discrete element texture synthesis.

101
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,160
And so their technique takes input layout,
example layout.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,800
And then it automatically senses a new,
larger layout.

103
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,880
Automatically.

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,850
Without explicit repetitions.

105
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,290
And what they do, is basically, iter,
iteratively refine it.

106
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,770
Let's start with just simple repetitions.

107
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,050
Patch on the copy, repeated patterns.

108
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,280
But gradually improves it.

109
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,690
And then you finally get a very beautiful
result.

110
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,770
And for each step we do this.

111
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,590
So, each step we repeat this.

112
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,710
So first, for each element in the
synthesized image.

113
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,208
For each element in the synthesized image.

114
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,826
We look for the element in the source

115
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:24,846
image with similar neighbor fill or
similar context.

116
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:28,671
So, suppose you have an element here, and
you have,

117
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,450
you know, circle and bro, circle and box
in this arrangement.

118
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,520
You try to find the most similar
arrangement.

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,441
So that a matching phase.

120
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:43,450
After identifying a match, then you
compare the context.

121
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,500
So this a synthesized context and this is
original context.

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,730
And then you compare these two and then

123
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,550
try to find ideal position for the,
surrounding object.

124
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:03,870
For example, this box should be more to
the left to be similar to the source.

125
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,421
So in this way, you compute ideal,

126
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:11,580
ideal positions, or target positions for
individual element.

127
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,530
For each pot, match.

128
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,620
And individual element belongs to multiple
matches.

129
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,500
We simply take average of all the related
ideal or target positions.

130
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,280
And then move the object to the target
position.

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,820
So by repeating them, then you will get
this kind of a result.

132
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,969
So starting from simple multi-copies.

133
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,346
And then you'll get seamless patches.

134
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,757
Okay so that's a brief description of the
system called Vignette.

135
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:46,740
Our original paper was published as a
interactive

136
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,460
texture designed migration with freeform
gestures for pen-an-ink illustration.

137
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,960
And the technique we used is called
Element Texture Synthesis.

138
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,599
And, it was introduced in SIGGRAPH of
2011.

139
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:01,649
Thank you.
