our
next
topic
is
dynamic
illustrations
.
and
the
work
we
introduce
here
,
is
called
sketch
based
dynamic
illustration
of
fluid
systems
.
and
the
program
we
want
to
address
here
,
is
that
it
is
tedious
to
illustrate
fluid
flow
.
suppose
you
have
a
engineering
system
or
architecture
.
or
organic
shapes
or
a
liver
system
.
there
is
a
lot
of
fluid
systems
,
and
you
may
want
to
describe
how
the
fluid
flow
in
these
kind
of
systems
.
and
then
you
want
to
get
these
kinds
of
results
.
and
it
's
very
tedious
to
draw
them
manually
.
so
,
our
idea
is
to
use
automatic
flow
simulation
to
automatically
synthesize
this
kind
of
data
for
illustrations
.
so
here
,
the
simulation
is
not
used
for
prediction
,
but
this
is
used
for
a
niche
[
unknown
]
illustration
.
so
let
me
show
you
a
video
[
blank_audio
]
so
this
is
basically
a
drawing
system
.
you
draw
something
,
and
the
system
continuously
runs
fluid
simulation
behind
the
scenes
.
and
they
add
fluid
flow
visualizations
automatically
.
so
you
draw
something
,
a
region
.
and
then
you
draw
pipes
.
and
then
as
soon
as
you
finish
drawing
a
system
,
system
starts
flow
simulation
behind
the
scene
.
so
it
visualize
a
,
a
detail
flow
,
and
also
shows
the
result
of
fluid
mixtures
.
[
blank_audio
]
so
this
tool
is
very
useful
for
explaining
fluid
phenomenons
.
[
blank_audio
]
so
you
can
interactively
edit
the
shape
by
deformation
tools
.
[
blank_audio
]
okay
.
so
an
,
our
[
unknown
]
example
is
here
[
blank_audio
]
so
here
we
use
these
two
for
explaining
surgical
operations
for
a
defected
heart
.
so
here
is
an
example
.
so
here
this
heart
has
very
specific
configuration
.
and
not
very
ideal
.
and
here
ideally
blue
blood
come
from
the
body
,
should
directly
go
to
the
lung
,
and
then
from
the
lung
,
fresh
blood
,
red
blood
comes
into
the
heart
,
and
then
red
one
should
go
through
the
body
,
however
here
blue
blood
is
mixed
together
with
red
one
.
and
then
purple
one
go
to
the
body
.
so
,
doctors
will
perform
a
surgical
operation
to
fix
this
.
however
,
before
they
that
,
they
need
to
explain
what
they
do
to
their
patients
,
or
their
patients
'
parents
.
however
,
it
's
very
difficult
to
do
that
with
standard
tools
,
currently
,
they
use
standard
pen
and
ink
.
black
and
white
illustration
to
describe
them
,
however
,
it
's
very
difficult
to
understand
it
.
but
preparing
this
kind
of
beautiful
illustration
using
computer
system
,
is
too
time
consuming
,
and
more
importantly
,
this
kind
of
heart
disease
has
different
configuration
for
each
patient
,
so
it
's
not
possible
to
prepare
a
template
before
hand
.
so
,
this
kind
of
tool
can
be
very
useful
.
to
explain
and
understand
complicated
flow
phenomenon
.
and
then
let
me
show
you
how
it
works
.
so
first
,
the
operation
start
with
connecting
the
locations
,
and
then
they
will
change
the
configuration
here
.
so
doctor
cuts
here
and
then
connect
them
.
so
,
as
soon
as
the
configuration
changes
,
the
fluid
simulation
changes
the
flow
,
prediction
.
[
blank_audio
]
so
next
one
is
the
most
important
one
.
the
doctor
stops
here
,
cut
here
,
and
then
connect
here
.
and
therefore
,
blood
suddenly
changes
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
finally
,
in
closing
this
hole
and
then
let
blood
directly
go
to
the
body
,
being
red
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
this
kind
of
technique
can
be
very
useful
for
various
fluid
phenomena
inside
of
your
body
,
like
blood
circulation
and
others
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
also
this
technique
is
,
can
be
used
for
engineering
systems
.
like
this
one
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
this
is
another
example
in
[
unknown
]
so
you
can
see
how
cold
air
and
le
warm
air
mix
together
and
flow
.
and
you
can
test
many
different
configurations
.
[
blank_audio
]
and
this
tool
can
be
also
used
for
,
for
explanation
of
pollution
of
rivers
,
and
so
.
and
so
now
let
me
describe
the
other
region
briefly
.
so
what
we
use
is
a
hybrid
fluid
simulation
system
.
so
user
draws
global
network
with
local
regions
.
and
we
apply
different
simulation
[
unknown
]
for
different
scale
.
because
single
scale
simulation
can
be
very
slow
.
so
,
for
a
global
network
simulation
,
we
use
simple
hydraulic
simulation
.
and
therefore
,
individual
local
region
,
we
use
hydrodynamic
simulations
.
and
so
,
to
use
a
[
unknown
]
node
inflow
,
and
there
forms
a
global
network
structure
,
hydraulics
compute
it
's
pipe
flow
and
the
node
pressure
,
and
then
from
this
node
pipe
flow
and
node
pressure
,
hydrodynamics
computes
a
detailed
,
computes
detailed
flow
,
inside
of
this
region
.
so
this
is
a
little
bit
in
too
involved
,
but
let
me
describe
the
way
.
the
first
line
is
hydraulics
simulation
for
a
global
network
.
here
,
input
is
node
inflow
qn
,
so
how
much
flow
comes
in
from
the
node
.
and
then
what
we
compute
is
pipe
flow
from
node
inflow
.
and
hydraulics
is
a
simplified
computational
method
directly
computed
from
compute
from
node
inflow
,
and
to
get
a
pipe
flow
.
and
after
pipe
flow
,
we
can
compute
a
pressure
,
pressure
drop
at
this
pipe
.
and
then
from
pipe
pressure
drop
,
we
can
compute
the
node
pressure
inside
of
each
node
.
and
you
can
get
these
all
information
by
solving
a
linear
global
system
once
.
it
's
very
fast
and
it
's
very
efficient
.
and
after
computing
pressure
node
,
and
[
unknown
]
pipe
flow
,
we
now
switch
to
our
regional
[
inaudible
]
so
for
each
local
region
.
we
compute
we
divide
into
a
lots
of
grid
cells
like
this
one
,
and
for
each
grade
cell
,
we
compute
pressure
and
velocity
,
and
in
order
the
compute
individual
pressure
and
velocity
,
we
use
a
very
standard
established
fluid
equation
called
navier-stokes
equation
.
so
this
one
is
a
little
bit
complicated
,
but
essentially
this
just
explains
the
relationship
with
fluid
velocity
and
fluid
pressure
,
you
know
,
if
there
's
a
huge
difference
in
fluid
pressure
,
and
it
causes
velocity
,
and
so
.
and
this
step
basically
just
solved
this
equation
times
step
,
each
time
step
on
this
grid
cells
inside
each
region
,
to
get
an
animation
.
so
so
original
paper
was
published
as
sketch
based
dynamic
illus
,
illustration
of
fluid
systems
.
and
if
you
want
to
learn
more
about
fluid
animation
,
i
recommend
you
to
read
some
text
books
.
one
example
is
fluid
simulation
for
computer
graphics
by
bridson
.
and
this
work
is
an
example
of
illustrative
animation
for
facilitating
understanding
.
and
interesting
early
dated
work
is
,
mathpad
,
which
takes
mathematical
[
inaudible
]
expression
,
and
they
automatically
generates
animation
,
based
on
the
mathematical
expression
.
so
that
's
,
this
is
the
end
of
our
second
week
of
this
interactive
computer
graphics
course
.
we
described
dia
,
diagram
beautification
.
and
[
inaudible
]
shape
manipulation
,
and
also
dynamic
illustration
with
a
fluid
simulation
.
thank
you
.
