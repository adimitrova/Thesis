so next topic is shape manipulation 
method we introduce 
here is called, asrigidaspossible shape 
manipulation 
goal this work is to move 
deform d shapes 
screen, if manipulating real 
object 
so in real world, you pick an 
object, 
hands, you manipulate it, 
moving around, rotate, pull, 
squash 
also you can, you know, shake head 
wave hand so 
so you many things to interact 
it, using hands real world 
thats we do, a computer 
there a couple previous works 
shape, manipulation shape deformation, 
couple problems 
popular approach is space walk, 
using a simple function you deform 
space, you deform 
images in, in embedded in space 
so this is efficient compute 
however, resulting deformation is like 
swapping 
space result is 
realistic 
possibility is use physics, 
simply meant mass spring water 
others 
this is a kind simulation real 
world, so realistic 
while this is slow to converge 

unstable, also cannot handle 
contradictory configuration 
so, 
let show you we 
so, let fast describe 
current state art 
so, this is typical drawing generator 
so you can, basic things 
you can, draw something 
you select an object 
move around 
so, you 
you rotate, you also scale 

however, unknown if you want to, like, 
shake head swing 
arm, suddenly become 
difficult you to redraw 
everything, 
basically 
and, here is a system we implemented 
so basically same, you draw three 
dimensional illustration, 
however, you finish drawing you 
use push pin tool, so you 
put pin here, you manipulate 
them, using pins 
so, if you pull this, you pull his, 
ears 
you you can, you know, shake 
head, make run this way 
so you can, deform illustration 
unknown 
this is useful making 
animation 
example if you draw this kind 
character 
again, this is two 
dimensional nothing special drawing 
soon i put push pin, you, 
you 
make deform, if this is a 
physical object 
then, you also press leg hold, 
sound to make motion 
then, in this way 
so you easily make run 
also you drag around, 
you get an interesting animation 
quickly 
traditionally, if you want to make this 
kind 
animation, you to draw many, many 
drawings 
here you draw something, 
theyre moving around, you will get an 
animation 
heres an example 
again, nothing special 
d drawing 
we press push pin, press 
record, 
you get this kind 
animation 
a kick, a kick 
you draw something else here, 
sound press record 
you get this kind animation 
so course, this is designed 
professional animations, 
we quickly generate interesting 
stories this kind technique 
let show you one example 
so, suppose you a is here, a 
worm here 
thats a frog fill 
lets lets put push 
pins, 
a select code, one 
two 
sound so in this way you make 
a crawling worm easily 
course, a computer so you 
multiply 
main quickly, you make an 
army worms 
so far, i used hand drawings 
unknown is basically a shape to 
formation 
you apply technique 
images, 
so this is a two dimensional 
image, photograph 
if you put push pins, starts 
to move if there is a physical d 
object here, youre going to 
generate interesting animations 
sound so far, i showing 
mouse 
operations, if you two hands, you 

example here, you two handed 
mouse, 
then, two handed mice, so, you 
grab screen two hands 
moving around a little bit 
deform 
if you a multi touch device, here 
we use sony 
computer science research laboratories 
smartskin system, 
detect fingertips 
you directly grab object 
screen, 
manipulating if you a, 
physical object 
so, this is new way making an 
deformable object animations 
blankaudio 
so you use hands 
also, two people work together 
sound a little bit 
so, so far, i showed deformation a 
lesion shape 
you also apply technique 
deformation a car 
so suppose, you a cob this way 
you 
grab a cob deform this 
way 
if you pull more, you get 
a larger region will deformed 
you pull more, you deform 
entire shape 
sound finally, this is 
essential, we, another convenient 
operation is 
smoothing 
so this smoothing will remove small noise, 

you rubbing, you will eventually get 
a beautiful shape 
so combining this pulling 
smoothing, you will get a 
professional looking smooth illustration, 
starting a rough sketch 
sound so okay 
so now, let briefly describe 
algorithm behind this technique 
so here this is input 
this is output 
a traditional approach is i said is 
physical stimulation 
so, moving handles, tries to 
deform 
say a little bit little, converting 
fours 
in acceleration 
so, this kind a step step 
computation slow 
here we propose is a kind instant 
computation 
final results this kind input 
information 
so input information is initial lets 
shape 
handle positions 
sound target locations 
handles 
we compute final result 
we is minimize shape 
distortion, satisfying constraints 
so let describe a little bit 
so again, input is coordinates handles 
new handle positions 
output this coordinated mesh 
vertices free vertices 
so i input system copies 
vertices 
we is we minimize 
distortion triangles 
so there many possible mesh particle 
positions 
one particular shape, minimize 
distortion individual triangle 
here, in this blue, blue triangle, 
corresponds to 
this triangle, we try to find 
shapes that minimize deformation 
distortion 
triangles, so thats a problem we want to 
solve 
mathematically, this is defined like 
this 
so rate is to minimize, this 
function, so this function 
is is triangle t, we compute 
formation 
distortion, depending given 
a products position 
we aggregate unknown 
distortions 
then, we try to find mesh unknown 
positions that minimize this energy 
we want is energy function 
specific definition that holds 
cost 
translation rotation 
translation means moving around, 
rotation is rotation 
so called alleged deformation 

there is deformation to this guy 
in this kind alleged deformation, 
there energy 
however, if you scale, make bigger 
smaller 
stretch press here, if you cause 
this kind 
deformation to triangle, a 
cause energy 
so we need particular energy cost 
function distortion unknown that 
satisfies this unknown 
another important requirement is that e 
energy, cost, quadra, 
quadratic in you 
means if u, if this energy is 
a quadratic to u, derivative is 
linear 
so you solve instantly solving si, 
simultaneous linear equations 
so thats we want 
so okay, ideally we want unknown 
functional, that causes zero energy 
translation rotation, unknown 
energy scale, stretch shear 
unfortunately, we dont unknown 
so theres energy in this world 
quadratic energy 
so we therefore combine two complementary 
suboptimal energies 
so heres a description 
so ideally, we want to this 
in this world, we is 
two kinds, so e e 
so e is basically, similarity transform 
supports translation rotation, 
also scales 
causes energy detect stretch 
shear, so this is kind lose energy 
another e is strict energy 
allows translations, rotation, 
scaling, stretch, shear 
we quadratic function 
so e is a little bit relaxed 
e is to a little bit strict 
so we combine two 
so we is fast apply e 
scale is wrong theyre 
waiting www e to fix scale 
so, heres we want 
so far input positions, we fast 
obtain intermediate result, like this one, 
using another e 
and, in this case e 
appropriate handles minimize the, shearing 
scaling 
scaling stretching, scaling is 
allowed 
so you get this kind inflation in this, 
you know left arm 
step , we 
correct size individual triangle 
we 
use energy two, to get correct answer 
so thats algorithm and, refer to 
paper details energies 
sound so original paper is published 
is asrigidaspossible shape 
manipulation, unknown file 
unknown serious paper to see 
details energy definition 
i said, previous existing technique 
is popular unknown space walk 
representative work is called feature 
based image metamorphosis 
published published in 
technique is using segregation 
triangular elements 
this work is inspired 
asrigidspossible shape interpolation 
technique published in 
also, work is related to recent 
works shape deformation 
i recommend that you to take a look 
this unknown paper called linear 
variational surface deformation methods 
published in, 
inaudible
