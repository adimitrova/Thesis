1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,600
Our next topic is Dynamic Illustrations.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,830
And the work we introduce here, is

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,560
called sketch based dynamic illustration
of fluid systems.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,720
And the program we want to address here,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,790
is that it is tedious to illustrate fluid
flow.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,660
Suppose you have a engineering system or
architecture.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,480
Or organic shapes or a liver system.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,940
There is a lot of fluid systems, and you
may want

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,410
to describe how the fluid flow in these
kind of systems.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,700
And then you want to get these kinds of
results.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,210
And it's very tedious to draw them
manually.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,130
So, our idea is to use automatic flow
simulation

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,950
to automatically synthesize this kind of
data for illustrations.

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,870
So here, the simulation is not used for
prediction,

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,857
but this is used for a niche [UNKNOWN]
illustration.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,177
So let me show you a video

17
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:08,950
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,411
So this is basically a drawing system.

19
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,603
You draw something, and the system

20
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:16,440
continuously runs fluid simulation behind
the scenes.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,920
And they add fluid flow visualizations
automatically.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,620
So you draw something, a region.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,830
And then you draw pipes.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,120
And then as soon as you finish drawing

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,450
a system, system starts flow simulation
behind the scene.

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,632
So it visualize a, a detail flow, and also
shows the result of fluid mixtures.

27
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:46,067
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:49,650
So this tool is very useful for explaining
fluid phenomenons.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:59,650
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:15,425
So you can interactively edit the shape by
deformation tools.

31
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:25,425
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:30,366
Okay.

33
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,076
So an, our [UNKNOWN] example is here

34
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:38,518
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:43,544
So here we use these two for explaining
surgical operations for a defected heart.

36
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:45,910
So here is an example.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,820
So here this heart has very specific
configuration.

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,580
And not very ideal.

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,036
And here ideally blue blood come from the
body, should directly

40
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:03,260
go to the lung, and then from the lung,
fresh blood, red

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,628
blood comes into the heart, and then red
one should go through the body,

42
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:13,763
however here blue blood is mixed together
with red one.

43
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:17,300
And then purple one go to the body.

44
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,484
So, doctors will perform a surgical
operation to fix this.

45
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:23,625
However, before they that, they need to
explain what

46
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,989
they do to their patients, or their
patients' parents.

47
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,727
However, it's very difficult to do that
with

48
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:33,389
standard tools, currently, they use
standard pen and ink.

49
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:36,136
Black and white illustration to describe
them,

50
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:39,020
however, it's very difficult to understand
it.

51
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:43,917
But preparing this kind of beautiful
illustration using computer

52
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,758
system, is too time consuming, and more
importantly, this kind

53
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:51,534
of heart disease has different
configuration for each patient,

54
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:55,330
so it's not possible to prepare a template
before hand.

55
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,870
So, this kind of tool can be very useful.

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,420
To explain and understand complicated flow
phenomenon.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,270
And then let me show you how it works.

58
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,840
So first, the

59
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,860
operation start with connecting the
locations, and

60
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,769
then they will change the configuration
here.

61
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,530
So doctor cuts here and then connect them.

62
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,991
So, as soon as the configuration changes,

63
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:27,056
the fluid simulation changes the flow,
prediction.

64
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:35,674
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,081
So next one is the most important one.

66
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:40,380
The doctor stops here, cut here, and then
connect here.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,819
And therefore, blood suddenly changes.

68
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:50,705
[BLANK_AUDIO]

69
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:54,341
And finally, in closing this hole and then

70
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,287
let blood directly go to the body, being
red.

71
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:04,369
[BLANK_AUDIO]

72
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,048
And this kind of technique can be very
useful for various

73
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:12,989
fluid phenomena inside of your body, like
blood circulation and others.

74
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:22,989
[BLANK_AUDIO]

75
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,957
And also this technique is, can be used
for engineering systems.

76
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,426
Like this one.

77
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:34,387
[BLANK_AUDIO]

78
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:38,286
And this is another example in [UNKNOWN]
so you can see

79
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:42,473
how cold air and le warm air mix together
and flow.

80
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:46,563
And you can test many different
configurations.

81
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:53,067
[BLANK_AUDIO]

82
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,791
And this tool can be also used for,

83
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,530
for explanation of pollution of rivers,
and so.

84
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,520
And so now let me describe the other
region briefly.

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,880
So what we use is a hybrid fluid
simulation system.

86
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,870
So user draws global network with local
regions.

87
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,500
And we apply different simulation
[UNKNOWN] for different scale.

88
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,910
Because single scale simulation can be
very slow.

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,570
So, for a global network simulation, we
use simple hydraulic simulation.

90
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,950
And therefore, individual local region, we
use hydrodynamic simulations.

91
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,246
And so, to use a [UNKNOWN] node inflow,
and there forms

92
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:46,528
a global network structure, hydraulics
compute it's pipe flow and the

93
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:53,021
node pressure, and then from this node
pipe flow and node pressure, hydrodynamics

94
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:58,330
computes a detailed, computes detailed
flow, inside of this region.

95
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,110
So this is a little bit in too involved,
but let me describe the way.

96
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,300
The first line is hydraulics simulation
for a global network.

97
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,160
Here, input is node inflow Qn, so how much
flow comes in from the node.

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,230
And then what we compute is pipe flow from
node inflow.

99
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,190
And hydraulics is a simplified
computational method directly computed

100
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,760
from compute from node inflow, and to get
a pipe flow.

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,890
And after pipe flow, we can compute a
pressure, pressure drop at this pipe.

102
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,850
And then from pipe pressure drop, we can

103
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,810
compute the node pressure inside of each
node.

104
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,770
And you can get these all information by
solving a linear global system once.

105
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,440
It's very fast and it's very efficient.

106
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,905
And after computing pressure node, and
[UNKNOWN] pipe flow, we

107
00:07:55,905 --> 00:08:00,750
now switch to our regional [INAUDIBLE] so
for each local region.

108
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,950
We compute we divide into a lots of grid
cells

109
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,150
like this one, and for each grade cell, we
compute pressure

110
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,080
and velocity, and in order the compute
individual pressure and velocity, we

111
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,770
use a very standard established fluid
equation called Navier-Stokes Equation.

112
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,040
So this one is a little bit complicated,
but

113
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,998
essentially this just explains the
relationship with fluid velocity

114
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,400
and fluid pressure, you know, if there's a
huge

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,496
difference in fluid pressure, and it
causes velocity, and so.

116
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:41,890
And this step basically just solved this
equation times

117
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,780
step, each time step on this grid cells
inside each region, to get an animation.

118
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
So so original paper was published as

119
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,370
sketch based dynamic illus, illustration
of fluid systems.

120
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,850
And if you want to learn more about fluid

121
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,980
animation, I recommend you to read some
text books.

122
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,137
One example is Fluid Simulation for
Computer Graphics by Bridson.

123
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,810
And this work is an example

124
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,450
of illustrative animation for facilitating
understanding.

125
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,370
And interesting early dated work

126
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,770
is, MathPad, which takes mathematical
[INAUDIBLE]

127
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,550
expression, and they automatically
generates

128
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,040
animation, based on the mathematical
expression.

129
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,160
So that's, this is the end of our

130
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,450
second week of this Interactive Computer
Graphics course.

131
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,856
We described dia, diagram beautification.

132
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:40,958
And [INAUDIBLE] shape manipulation, and
also

133
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,970
dynamic illustration with a fluid
simulation.

134
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,270
Thank you.
