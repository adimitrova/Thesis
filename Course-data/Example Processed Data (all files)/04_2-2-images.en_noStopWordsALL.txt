week
going
talk
images
display
processing
later
weeks
going
go
lot
detail
images
represented
today
mostly
laying
images
look
create
animations
sequence
images
look
slides
've
got
image
taken
sequence
mick
prepared
dj
app
dj
app
going
show
would
display
kind
image
processing
matthew
last
week
talked
loading
sound
files
playing
many
ways
loading
images
similar
something
called
pimage
object
uh
represents
image
load
file
create
variable
type
pimage
load
based
file
name

matthew
noted
last
week
go
data
folder
processing
sketch
like
like
audio
files
matthew
talked
've
got
pimage
displaying
simple
use
image
command

command
draws

've
loaded
call
draw
method
normally
load

setup
main
parameter
image
command
takes
obviously
image
going
display
see
takes
two
images
parameters
two
numbers
give
position
want
draw
image
fact
pass
yet
another
two
numbers
size
image
default
draws
image
actual
size
pixels
adjust
size
want
passing
width
height
've
said
give
position

actually
mean
image
big
thing
mean

asked
take
pick
turns
actually
define

number
ways
...

also
use
imagemode
center
means
must
position

often
convenient
often
intuitive
think

call

zero
top

screen
probably
even
want
would
set
set
position
something
else
could
get
could
position
well
going
talk
little
bit
positioning
images
first
let
look
example
working
practice
simple
processing
sketch
involves
loading
displaying
image
creating
top
sketch
image
variable
loading
file
something
clever
setting
size
screen
exactly
size
image
using
image
width
imadge
dot
height
find
width
height
screen
drawing
image
position
0,0.
displaying
image
move
image
changing
positions
parsing
change
size
going
show
little
bit
careful
set
size
100
100
maintaining
aspect
ratio
image
squishing
've
got
ta
careful
make
sure
always
keeping
ratio
width
height
otherwise
going
get
squished
stretched
image
one
nice
way
noise
calculating
height
image
maintains
aspect
ratio
based
width
setting
width
100.
taking

100
multiplying

okay
last
thing
showed

imagemode
corner
n't
change
anything
exactly
going
leave
little
bit
make
clear
move
image
mode
sensor
would
different
actually
let
let
draw
mouse
position
will
clear
happening
drawing

position
mouse
center

mouse
position
corner

mouse
position
okay
let
look
little
bit
lay
images
nicely
use
commands
get
right
sort
layout
feeling
getting
correct
layout
screen
really
important
part
getting
app
look
nice
need
think
little
bit
maybe
talk
little
lesson
today
let
look
example
look
big
rectangle
processing
window
draw
image
point
box
one
basic
things
might
want
sent
image
screen
either
right
middle
centered
1,1

often
sent
horizontally
using
image
mode

drawing
position
box
width
divided

halfway
across
screen
going
send
horizontally
want
near
top
vertically
top
n't
want
zero
going
add
little
margin
margin
two
small
value
1020
pixels
moves
adds
little
edge
top
screen
window
examples
want
lay
things
columns
well
still
relative
middle
screen
want
position
relative
middle
screen
want
put
one
side
middle
screen
want
moved
middle

margin
add

move
half

image.height
two
image
mid

specifying

kind
thing
might
want
looking

need
think
relative

like
halfway
point

want
add

give

mick
will
show

make

play
fast
enough
gives
us

would
look
like
setup
create

zero
draw
draw
current
image.that
gives
us
currentimage
add
1
still
use
things
like
mousepressed
mousedragged
control
playback
example
press
mouse
could
set
current

zero
would
reset
playing
beginning
show
example
want
go

last
thin
looping
fine
adding

pack
n't
rewrite
load

thing
'd
like
cover
playing
pausing

sometimes
want
stop

temporarilty

use
called
boolean
variable

values
true
false
acts

true
means
