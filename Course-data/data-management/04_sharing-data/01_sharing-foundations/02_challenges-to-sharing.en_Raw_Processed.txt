sited lack funding, 
reasons making data available 
number , perceived risks

that may scooped 
another researcher could 
discover errors in data,

using data, misuse data 
number , data contained confidential 
sensitive information

publishing articles in books 
often based data 
however, theres currently 
a similar reward system 
publishing data 
there easy answers to overcome 
challenges christine borgman 
states, sharing research data is 
an intricate difficult problem 
in words, a conundrum however, 
one challenge to 
sharing data that researchers 
cited is a lack experience 
knowledge data management 
applying data management practices 
taught in this mooc, researchers 
information professionals will 
tools in toolbox 
successfully preparing data to share
