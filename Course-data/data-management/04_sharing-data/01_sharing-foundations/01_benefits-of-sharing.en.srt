2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:11,452
Thus far, we have touched on FINRA
expectations regarding data sharing as

3
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:16,078
well as some of the data management
practices that can help researchers

4
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:18,180
share their data efficiently.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,690
This includes following
metadata standards,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:28,220
creating documentation and
following quality assurance protocols.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,480
Now, we will delve more deeply into
the topic of sharing digital data.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,290
By the end of this lesson,

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,250
you will be able to identify some
of the benefits of sharing data.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,090
You will also be able to identify
some of the challenges and

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,530
obstacles to data sharing.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,900
And finally, you will recognize the
importance and elements of data citations.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,860
Let's consider the key players
when it comes to data sharing.

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,424
First, there is the data creator or
producer.

15
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:06,381
This is the person or entity who is
making the data available to share.

16
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:12,420
There is also the person who reuses
the data or the secondary data user.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,580
Finally, there is the data repository.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,650
This is where the data creator
makes the data available.

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,820
A data repository plays a key role
in enhancing the discovery and

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,540
reuse of the data.

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,410
And ideally,
creating a formal data citation.

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,302
So what are some of
the benefits of data sharing?

23
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,401
As we discussed previously,
funders are encouraging.

24
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:42,708
And in some cases, requiring researcher
to make their data available for

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,304
sharing to support transparency and
openness and

26
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:49,309
maximize funders return on investment.

27
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:54,975
The specific benefits of data sharing to
the research community are numerous and

28
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:57,650
discussed in much of the literature.

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,819
We will now look at the top ten
benefits of sharing research data.

30
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,273
For more information on data sharing
literature, check out the resources for

31
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:08,090
this module.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,260
Number one, sharing data reinforces
open scientific inquiry.

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,160
Making data openly available
decreases the potential for

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,410
disagreements among researchers and
allows scientific inquiry

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,930
to progress unimpeded to the benefit
of the entire research community.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,380
Number two,
sharing data supports the verification and

37
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,390
replication of original results.

38
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,150
By making data available, data can be used
to verify or replicate published results.

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,940
Verification can bolster the original
results or it can expose errors.

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,750
Either outcome helps strengthen and

41
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,240
protect the integrity of
the scientific record.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,290
Number three, sharing data promotes
new research and allows for

43
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,560
the testing of new or alternative methods.

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,940
While data creators may have
one research question in mind,

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,100
the same data may be reused to answer
new and innovative research questions.

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,320
Number four, sharing data encourages
collaboration and multiple perspectives.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,620
Sharing data can begin conversations
between researchers across disciplines.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,310
This could lead to cross-disciplinary
collaborations or the exchange of

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,830
knowledge across fields that could result
in new innovative research approaches.

50
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,350
Number five, sharing data provides
important teaching resources.

51
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,820
Data are extremely valuable
pedagogical tools.

52
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,990
Instructors may use data
in analytical exercises or

53
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,120
students may model their own work
after high-quality data examples.

54
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,200
Data can also provide students with
firsthand experience in verifying results.

55
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,200
Number six,

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,260
sharing data reduces costs by avoiding
duplicate data collection efforts.

57
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,360
Avoiding unintended duplicate data
collections saves both respondents and

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,910
researchers valuable time and resources
and freeze up researcher funds for

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,760
other projects.

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,580
Number seven, sharing data protects
against faulty or fraudulent data.

61
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,071
Over the past few years,

62
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:32,627
there have been multiple stories in
the news about misconduct in research.

63
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:36,458
Sharing data promotes transparency and
accountability,

64
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:42,710
which lessens the potential for purposeful
falsification or distortion of data.

65
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,280
It also allows reusers to
detect unintentional errors.

66
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,897
And finally, the expectation that
others may be verifying data

67
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:56,838
should encourage greater
care in original analyses.

68
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,966
Number eight,
sharing data enhances the visibility and

69
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,810
overall impact of research projects.

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,950
Making research data available
within a data repository

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,580
can increase the visibility of researched
products and increase the impact

72
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,320
of a project by encouraging
secondary analysis of the data.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,980
Scholars have also found a significant
association between publishing data and

74
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,180
increased citation rates.

75
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,260
In the end, sharing data does not only
benefit the broader research community,

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,950
but can also produce potential
career benefits for researchers.

77
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,760
Number nine, sharing data
preserves data for future use.

78
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,500
If a researcher makes their data available
for sharing within a data repository,

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,720
then they can be sure that
the data will be available and

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,190
understandable for the long-term for
their own and others use.

81
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,065
Number ten, sharing data helps
the broader community and

82
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,589
individual researchers do better research.

83
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:08,322
By sharing data, researchers
support both their own research and

84
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:13,816
the broader research community resulting
in science that is more accurate,

85
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:18,989
more open, more knowledgeable and
has more resources at its disposal.

86
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:28,279
