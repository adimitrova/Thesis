i mentioned before, 
one obstacles to sharing data is a 
lack career incentives researchers 
one method to reward researchers 
sharing data is to ensure 
receive proper acknowledgement 
credit data citation 
data citation provides a standardized 
method secondary users to cite data 
data citations also 
used data producers 
to cite data 
standalone research products 
instance, 
nsf renamed publications to products 
in biographical sketch section 
grant application researchers 
list datasets along 
publications research products 
currently, work is done 
in data curation field to 
establish data citation principles 
standards 
instance, joint declaration 
data citation principles, 
is a synthesis work 
a number prominent groups, 
established principles to guide 
development human understandable 
machine actionable data citations 
eight principles include importance, 
credit 
attribution, evidence, 
unique identification, 
access, persistence, 
specificity verifiability, 
interoperability flexibility 
another group important work 
in expanding infrastructure 
culture citing data is datacite 
datacite works data repositories 
incentives to assigned persistent 
identifierssuch digital object 
identifiers, dois, to data 
work, 
data sites support simple 
effective methods data citation, 
discovery, access 
doi insures that data 
discovered online, 
regardless located 
so lets take a look an actual data 
citation generated data verse 
look elements 
this citation map 
to joint declaration 
data citation principles 
author data publisher, 
distributer information, 
maps to principle credit 
attribution, stresses 
importance contributors 
receiving due credit data 
version information maps to 
principle specificity 
verifiability, stresses 
importance enough information 
to make sure data retrieved 
used data cited 
finally, doi maps directly to 
principles unique identification, 
access persistence 
doi provides a method 
identification that is machine 
actionable well provides 
stable access to data resource 
using a persistent identifier 
one thing researchers may want to consider 
choosing a data repository 
making data available is whether 
repository supports creation unique 
data citations that embody joint 
declaration data citation principles 
proper citation datasets supports 
reproducibility research, 
ensures proper credit researchers, 
enables tracking data reuse 
although there real challenges 
that may make difficult, 
in cases, impossible to share data, 
there significant benefits 
to researchers 
broader research community 
using techniques information 
provided in this mooc, you will better 
equipped to overcome challenges 
reap benefits data sharing 
dont forget, cite data
