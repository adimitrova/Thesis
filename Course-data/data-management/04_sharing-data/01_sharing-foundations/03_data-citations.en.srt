2
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:07,734
As I mentioned before,

3
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:14,360
one of the obstacles to sharing data is a
lack of career incentives for researchers.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,440
One method to reward researchers for
sharing their data is to ensure

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,480
they receive proper acknowledgement and
credit for their data through citation.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,370
Data citation provides a standardized
method for secondary users to cite data.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,650
Data citations can also be
used by data producers.

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,730
To cite their own data as
standalone research products.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,320
For instance,
NSF has renamed publications to products

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,290
in its biographical sketch section of
its grant application where researchers

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,259
can now list datasets along with
publications and other research products.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,830
Currently, work is being done
in the data curation field to

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,930
establish data citation principles and
standards.

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,590
For instance, the Joint Declaration
of Data Citation Principles,

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,950
which is a synthesis of work by
a number of prominent groups,

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,280
has established principles to guide the
development of human understandable and

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,230
machine actionable data citations.

18
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,851
The eight principles include importance,
credit and

19
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:31,374
attribution, evidence,
unique identification,

20
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:36,400
access, persistence,
specificity and verifiability,

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,820
and interoperability and flexibility.

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,380
Another group doing important work
in expanding the infrastructure and

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,220
culture for citing data is DataCite.

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,075
DataCite works with data repositories
incentives to assigned persistent

25
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:59,520
identifierssuch as digital object
identifiers, or DOIs, to data.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,130
Through their work,
data sites support simple and

27
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,720
effective methods of data citation,
discovery, and access.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,820
The DOI insures that data
can be discovered online,

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,770
regardless of where they are located.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,480
So let's take a look at an actual data
citation generated by the data verse and

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,670
look at how the elements
of this citation map

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,090
to the joint declaration of
data citation principles.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,128
The author and data publisher,
or distributer information,

34
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:33,308
maps to the principle of credit and
attribution, which stresses

35
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:37,799
the importance of contributors
receiving due credit for their data.

36
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,656
The version information maps to
the principle of specificity and

37
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:48,487
verifiability, which stresses the
importance of having enough information

38
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:53,712
to make sure the data retrieved and
used are the same as the data cited.

39
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:59,705
Finally, the DOI maps directly to
the principles of unique identification,

40
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:01,714
access and persistence.

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,812
The DOI provides a method for

42
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:08,451
identification that is machine
actionable as well as provides

43
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:13,450
stable access to the data resource
using a persistent identifier.

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,368
One thing researchers may want to consider
when choosing a data repository for

45
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:25,680
making their data available is whether the
repository supports the creation of unique

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,200
data citations that embody the joint
declaration of data citation principles.

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,180
Proper citation of datasets supports
the reproducibility of research,

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,330
ensures proper credit for researchers,
and enables the tracking of data reuse.

49
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,670
Although there are very real challenges
that may make it difficult, or

50
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,960
in some cases, impossible to share data,
there are significant benefits

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,830
to both researchers and
the broader research community.

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,227
By using these techniques and information
provided in this MOOC, you will be better

53
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:06,213
equipped to overcome these challenges and
reap the benefits of data sharing.

54
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,131
And don't forget, cite the data.

55
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:15,119
