thus far, we touched finra 
expectations regarding data sharing 
well data management 
practices that help researchers 
share data efficiently 
this includes following 
metadata standards, 
creating documentation 
following quality assurance protocols 
now, we will delve deeply 
topic sharing digital data 
end this lesson, 
you will able to identify 
benefits sharing data 
you will also able to identify 
challenges 
obstacles to data sharing 
finally, you will recognize 
importance elements data citations 
lets consider key players 
comes to data sharing 
first, there is data creator 
producer 
this is person entity is 
making data available to share 
there is also person reuses 
data secondary data user 
finally, there is data repository 
this is data creator 
makes data available 
a data repository plays a key role 
in enhancing discovery 
reuse data 
ideally, 
creating a formal data citation 
so 
benefits data sharing 
we discussed previously, 
funders encouraging 
in cases, requiring researcher 
to make data available 
sharing to support transparency 
openness 
maximize funders return investment 
specific benefits data sharing to 
research community numerous 
discussed in much literature 
we will look top ten 
benefits sharing research data 
information data sharing 
literature, check resources 
this module 
number one, sharing data reinforces 
open scientific inquiry 
making data openly available 
decreases potential 
disagreements among researchers 
allows scientific inquiry 
to progress unimpeded to benefit 
entire research community 
number two, 
sharing data supports verification 
replication original results 
making data available, data used 
to verify replicate published results 
verification bolster original 
results expose errors 
either outcome helps strengthen 
protect integrity 
scientific record 
number three, sharing data promotes 
new research allows 
testing new alternative methods 
while data creators may 
one research question in mind, 
data may reused to answer 
new innovative research questions 
number four, sharing data encourages 
collaboration multiple perspectives 
sharing data begin conversations 
between researchers across disciplines 
this could lead to crossdisciplinary 
collaborations exchange 
knowledge across fields that could result 
in new innovative research approaches 
number five, sharing data provides 
important teaching resources 
data extremely valuable 
pedagogical tools 
instructors may use data 
in analytical exercises 
students may model work 
highquality data examples 
data also provide students 
firsthand experience in verifying results 
number six, 
sharing data reduces costs avoiding 
duplicate data collection efforts 
avoiding unintended duplicate data 
collections saves respondents 
researchers valuable time resources 
freeze researcher funds 
projects 
number seven, sharing data protects 
faulty fraudulent data 
past few years, 
there multiple stories in 
news misconduct in research 
sharing data promotes transparency 
accountability, 
lessens potential purposeful 
falsification distortion data 
also allows reusers to 
detect unintentional errors 
finally, expectation that 
others may verifying data 
encourage greater 
care in original analyses 
number eight, 
sharing data enhances visibility 
overall impact research projects 
making research data available 
within a data repository 
increase visibility researched 
products increase impact 
a project encouraging 
secondary analysis data 
scholars also found a significant 
association between publishing data 
increased citation rates 
in end, sharing data 
benefit broader research community, 
also produce potential 
career benefits researchers 
number nine, sharing data 
preserves data future use 
if a researcher makes data available 
sharing within a data repository, 
sure that 
data will available 
understandable longterm 
others use 
number ten, sharing data helps 
broader community 
individual researchers better research 
sharing data, researchers 
support research 
broader research community resulting 
in science that is accurate, 
open, knowledgeable 
resources disposal
