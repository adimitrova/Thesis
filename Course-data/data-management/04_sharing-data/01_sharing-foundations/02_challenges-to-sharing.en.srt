2
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:09,360
We have just covered a lot
of benefits of sharing data.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,460
But there are also multiple challenges,
or obstacles

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,340
that can effect researchers ability or
willingness to share their data.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,640
Let's now go over the top five of several
known challenges to data sharing.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,605
Number one, it takes time and
effort to make data shareable.

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,000
Making data publicly available
can be a labor intensive and

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
time consuming process.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,053
In a 2011 survey of researchers,
over 50% sited insufficient time.

10
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:48,830
And 40% sited lack of funding, as their
reasons for not making data available.

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,120
Number 2, perceived risks from
loss of control of the data.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,330
By sharing data,

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,290
researchers may believe they're
relinquishing control over their data.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,830
This can raise concerns
that they may be scooped or

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,060
another researcher could
discover errors in their data,

16
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,640
could reach contradictory conclusions
using the data, or misuse the data.

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,900
Number 3, data contained confidential or
sensitive information.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,130
Data collected from human subjects may
contain protected health information,

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,870
or personally identifiable information,
and researchers are responsible for

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,350
protecting this sensitive data.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,830
In some cases,
de-identifying data may be an option, but

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,350
this can also be a labor
intensive process.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,930
In other cases,
removing certain identifiable information

24
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,130
could negatively effect the usability
of the data for secondary analysis.

25
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,880
Number four, the ownership of the data
may be unclear or problematic.

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,980
Researchers must also consider if they
even have the right to share the data.

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,330
In the case of collaborative projects,

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,650
they will want to discuss
the data with their partners.

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,110
In some cases, for instance,
if the data were proprietary or

30
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,600
funded by private entities, researchers
may not even be permitted to share

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,150
the data due to intellectual property or
copyright concerns.

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,220
Number five, a lack of incentives for
sharing data.

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,870
And last but not least, in many ways
the current academic culture lacks

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,830
the incentive structure to properly
reward researchers who share their data.

35
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,290
Researchers gain career advancement
through publishing articles in books

36
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,110
often based on data.

37
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,970
However, there's currently not
a similar reward system for

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,550
publishing the data themselves.

39
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,910
There are no easy answers to overcome
these challenges as Christine Borgman

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,370
states, "Sharing research data is
an intricate and difficult problem.

41
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,164
In other words, a conundrum." However,
one other challenge to

42
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:10,048
sharing data that researchers have
cited is a lack of experience and

43
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,377
knowledge of data management.

44
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:17,918
By applying the data management practices
taught in this MOOC, researchers and

45
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:23,051
other information professionals will
have more tools in their toolbox for

46
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:28,360
successfully preparing data to share
in an efficient and effective manner.
