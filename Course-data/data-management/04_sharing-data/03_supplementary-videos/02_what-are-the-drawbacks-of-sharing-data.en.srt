2
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:08,784
Data could be repurposed in different
ways, so it could be reused for

3
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:10,740
entirely different things.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,722
And we're finding things
like YouTube videos can be

5
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,150
used to determine whether
somebody has Parkinson's.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,600
So that was not looking at
speech patterns in video,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,540
was not envisioned at collection,
you can find that out.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,850
Now, that can be a two edge sword.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,970
So one of the problems with data
sharing especially when you're sharing

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,870
data about people, is that you might
violate privacy and confidentiality.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,680
It can be very difficult to allow
serendipitous discovery of stuff,

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,080
especially with rich sources like video or
social networks, and also guarantee

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,210
that no one will ever learn anything about
an individual from that data source.

14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,228
Besides confidentiality,

15
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,788
another issue that somebody could
prove that you did something wrong.

16
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:12,445
Or stupid.

17
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:15,920
And that's an individual disincentive.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,590
I think in general that's a social
incentive for data sharing.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,300
In that it helps with error correction.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,700
But it makes, from an individual point of
view, if the norm is not to share, that

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,730
may disincent you from sharing, because
you could be proved to make a mistake.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,340
And a third is that, it's like
everything else, it takes time, effort.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,290
For a lot of data, especially

24
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,360
things in the social sciences, traditional
surveys and stuff, the amount of bits,

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,310
the size of the bits is so small that
storage costs are not really the issue.

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,360
But for some new forms of data, videos,

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,080
social networks,
storage costs can be high.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:10,180
And for anything, what you have
to do to document instrument etc.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,800
So that not only you and
your research group understands it,

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
but everybody else who's in
a particular domain can understand it

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,790
without talking to you,
is going to be more.

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,340
That's capturing that tacit knowledge and
documenting it.

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,900
Now peculiarly that's also maybe a good
thing from a scientific practice point of

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,920
view, but it's an additional cost.

35
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,540
>> The drawbacks of sharing data, I guess

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,710
I would think of them more as
considerations in sharing data.

37
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,350
Because I think that, really,
we should be sharing data.

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,810
We may have to delay.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,060
And there could be valid reasons for
delays.

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,670
That could be that reasonably
the researchers who spend a whole lot of

41
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,170
their time and effort in creativity and
getting the data

42
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,740
have the window of opportunity to publish
about it, and I think that's valid.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,102
One of the things we did at ICPSI
was have a delayed release,

44
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:09,960
so you deposit it right away,

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,900
there is a three year window in which the
researchers can do what they need to do.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,290
And at that point its agreed upon,
and then it will be shared.

47
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,490
If you wait until the research project
gets to that point, very often the data

48
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,290
preservation can be less easy.

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,050
More costly.

50
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,700
>> Well I don't know if there
are drawbacks to sharing data, but

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,630
there are certainly
challenges to sharing data.

52
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,620
Particularly in the social sciences.

53
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,920
Much of our data is about people and
those people have rights to privacy and

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,060
rights to have their own being
protected by us as researchers.

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,550
Often subjects exchange

56
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,960
their data with the assurance that
they will be protected in some way.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,970
And so we have an obligation to do
no harm as we're doing our research.

58
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,500
There are some challenges
I think particularly for

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,640
young scholars that spend a lot of
time and energy collecting their data.

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,990
They want to have an opportunity to
do their research, publish out of

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,450
their data before they have to expose it
to the rest of the research community.

62
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,400
So there are challenges like that
in the process of sharing data,

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,960
but I don't think those
are reasons not to share data.

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,305
I think those are just issues that
have to be managed as we try to

65
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:31,244
be more open about the science
that we're conducting.

66
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:36,219
