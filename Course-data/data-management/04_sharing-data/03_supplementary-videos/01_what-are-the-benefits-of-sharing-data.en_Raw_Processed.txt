oh, i think reason to 
passionate data sharing 
replication is 
impact 
so really terrific that we 
individually get to work scholarship, 
invent new things, come 
discoveries that ones ever known 
in history world, 
matter small 
feels really great 
however, if you actually 
change infrastructure, 
change norms, you 
an impact many, many people 
collectively, we way better 
one us individually 
one purpose is a sort sanity check, 
a basic we reproduce this, 
we see you 
transparency replication 
around that particular experiment 
another is, generally, science to 
move forward you need evidence 
data sharing always produces 
better quality data projects 
process 
to rigorous 
sufficiently well documented in 
creating an archive data set 
that means ive got better data sets, 
better documentation 
might data, 
better this project 
second thing is, 
i hope itll help productivity 
laugh i hope handing this data 
set to dr einsteins lab that this graph 
will draw will actually get 
public use, published a paper 
maybe well get another prize 
but, fundamentally, 
data will see light day, 
well hence better 
productivity this study 
third thing 
is kind a general 
hope that archiving 
data that in future, 
there will some, 
this project, 
larger purpose served 
open access 
sometimes that might tangible, 
public, 
fund research 
participate in studies, 
might greater faith in research 
process research 
might less suspicious 
government is research 
money, professors 
in laboratories, so forth 
people talk open 
access to data, often still 
talking article 
research that points to data 
i think that also 
getting a sense that nature 
research practice is changing 
that theres an expectation 
to share data, 
only, 
heres article i 
so, i think part that whole trend 
we moving things like phone 
surveys, we call people 
ask much like 
hillary clinton, getting fewer 
fewer responses phones, 
to looking things that people 
say blogs, 
tweets, facebook, 
analyzing sentiments, 
behavior 
seems to that we 
a tremendous potential to 
use this information to understand humans, 
human behavior, human institutions 
we also a tremendous 
responsibility to make sure 
that that evidence base is available, 
to people working 
facebook, to people like, 
friends vice 
presidents twitter 
to research community, 
to public large, so that 
understand how, learning, 
applies to political 
institutions, social institutions 
that that evidence will 
available long future, 
developing 
ways understanding 
so theres a lot 
researchers to make 
form impact in field, 
otherwise nobody recognizes 
worth research 
so make an impact either 
data become basis 
future research, so 
somebody elses research will 
depend upon observations 
that to happen, you to share 
observations publish them, so 
people 
next generation research 
science is is community 
people acting in cooperation 
competition, in pursuit goals 
you a community 
people that, 
we learn things that 
one us couldnt possibly learn 
so thats really science is 
that is accounts 
progress in society 
last several hundred years 
thats we want to contribute to 
so in that sense, is like a village, 
is like a community 
belonging to a community means 
that you need to give share 
to that particular community 
data is coin realm, 
if you share that people, 
people will share data you, 
everybody will better that
