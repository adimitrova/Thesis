2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:08,054
Oh, I think the reason to be
passionate about data sharing and

3
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:11,540
replication is because of
the impact it can have.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,444
So it's really terrific that we each
individually get to work on scholarship,

5
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:21,200
and invent new things, and come up with
discoveries that no one's ever known

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,252
before in the history of the world,
no matter how small they are.

7
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:28,240
It feels really great.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,140
However, if you can actually
change the infrastructure, and

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,990
change the norms, then you can have
an impact on many, many more people.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,900
And collectively, we can do way better
than any one of us can individually.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,100
>> One purpose is a sort of sanity check,

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,770
a basic can we reproduce this,
can we see what you did.

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,180
Transparency and replication
around that particular experiment.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,380
Another is, more generally, for science to
move forward you need all of the evidence.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,990
>> Data sharing always produces
better quality data for my projects.

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,767
Just the process of
having to be rigorous and

17
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:18,138
sufficiently well documented in
creating an archive data set.

18
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:23,790
That means I've got better data sets,
better documentation.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,522
Might all be the same data, but
it's better for this project now.

20
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,865
Second thing is,
I hope it'll help productivity.

21
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:42,380
[LAUGH] I hope by handing off this data
set to Dr. Einstein's lab that this graph

22
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,790
they will draw will actually get into
the public use, be published as a paper.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,890
Maybe we'll get another prize.

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,407
But, fundamentally,
these data will see the light of day, and

25
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,551
we'll hence have better
productivity from this study.

26
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:01,537
And then the third thing
is kind of a more general

27
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:06,898
hope that by archiving
the data that in the future,

28
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:12,259
there will be some,
not just for this project, but

29
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:17,638
some larger purpose served
by having open access.

30
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,188
And sometimes that might be tangible,
such as the public,

31
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,454
who fund our research and
participate in our studies,

32
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:28,440
might have greater faith in research and
the process of research.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,970
They might be less suspicious about what
the government is doing with its research

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,950
money, or what professors do
in laboratories, and so forth.

35
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,620
>> When people talk about open
access to data, they often still

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,760
are talking about the article about
the research that points to the data.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,550
But I think that we're also
getting a sense that the nature of

38
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,620
the research practice itself is changing.

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,910
And that there's an expectation
to share the data,

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,970
not only,
here's my article about what I did.

41
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,430
So, I think it's part of that whole trend.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,806
>> We are moving from things like phone
surveys, where we call people up and

43
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:17,023
ask them how much they like
Hillary Clinton, getting fewer and

44
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:22,340
fewer responses on the phones,
to looking at things that people

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,164
say through blogs,
through tweets, through Facebook,

46
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:31,517
and analyzing their sentiments,
their behavior.

47
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:36,395
And it seems to me that we
have a tremendous potential to

48
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:40,425
use this information to understand humans,

49
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:44,360
human behavior, and human institutions.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,800
But we also have a tremendous
responsibility to make sure

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,890
that that evidence base is available,

52
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,440
not just to people who are working at
Facebook, not just to people who are like,

53
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,680
we're friends with the vice
presidents of Twitter.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,880
But to the research community, and

55
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,130
to the public at large, so that they
understand how, what we're learning,

56
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:22,170
how it applies to their political
institutions, their social institutions.

57
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,340
And that that evidence will be
available long into the future,

58
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,090
because we're just developing
ways of understanding it now.

59
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,240
So there's a lot more.

60
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,710
>> Most researchers have to make
some form of impact in their field,

61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,060
otherwise nobody recognizes
the worth of their research.

62
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,850
So they can make an impact by either

63
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,990
having their data become the basis for
future research, so

64
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,020
somebody else's research will
depend upon your observations.

65
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,375
For that to happen, you have to share
your observations or publish them, so

66
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,650
other people can then do
the next generation of research.

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,970
>> What science is is the community
of people acting in cooperation and

68
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,000
competition, in pursuit of the same goals.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,139
When you have a community
of people doing that,

70
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,740
then we can learn things that any
one of us couldn't possibly learn.

71
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,600
So that's really what science is.

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,050
That is what accounts for

73
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,320
most of the progress in society over
the last several hundred years.

74
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
And that's what we want to contribute to.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,310
>> So in that sense, It is like a village,
it is like a community.

76
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,530
And belonging to a community means
that you need to give your share

77
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,680
to that particular community.

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,533
And data is the coin of the realm, and
if you can share that with other people,

79
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,648
other people will share the data with you,
and everybody will be better for that.

80
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:49,949
