data could repurposed in different 
ways, so could reused 
entirely different things 
finding things 
like youtube videos 
used to determine whether 
somebody parkinsons 
so that looking 
speech patterns in video, 
envisioned collection, 
you find that 
now, that a two edge sword 
so one problems data 
sharing especially youre sharing 
data people, is that you might 
violate privacy confidentiality 
difficult to allow 
serendipitous discovery stuff, 
especially rich sources like video 
social networks, also guarantee 
that one will ever learn anything 
an individual that data source 
besides confidentiality, 
another issue that somebody could 
prove that you something wrong 
stupid 
thats an individual disincentive 
i think in general thats a social 
incentive data sharing 
in that helps error correction 
makes, an individual point 
view, if norm is to share, that 
may disincent you sharing, 
you could proved to make a mistake 
a third is that, like 
everything else, takes time, effort 
a lot data, especially 
things in social sciences, traditional 
surveys stuff, amount bits, 
size bits is so small that 
storage costs really issue 
new forms data, videos, 
social networks, 
storage costs high 
anything, you 
to to document instrument etc 
so that you 
research group understands it, 
everybody else whos in 
a particular domain understand 
without talking to you, 
is going to 
thats capturing that tacit knowledge 
documenting 
peculiarly thats also maybe a good 
thing a scientific practice point 
view, an additional cost 
drawbacks sharing data, i guess 
i would think 
considerations in sharing data 
i think that, really, 
we sharing data 
we may to delay 
there could valid reasons 
delays 
that could that reasonably 
researchers spend a whole lot 
time effort in creativity 
getting data 
window opportunity to publish 
it, i think thats valid 
one things we icpsi 
a delayed release, 
so you deposit right away, 
there is a three year window in 
researchers need to 
that point agreed upon, 
will shared 
if you wait until research project 
gets to that point, often data 
preservation less easy 
costly 
well i dont know if there 
drawbacks to sharing data, 
there certainly 
challenges to sharing data 
particularly in social sciences 
much data is people 
people rights to privacy 
rights to 
protected us researchers 
often subjects exchange 
data assurance that 
will protected in way 
so we an obligation to 
harm research 
there challenges 
i think particularly 
young scholars that spend a lot 
time energy collecting data 
want to an opportunity to 
research, publish 
data to expose 
to rest research community 
so there challenges like that 
in process sharing data, 
i dont think 
reasons to share data 
i think issues that 
to managed we try to 
open science
