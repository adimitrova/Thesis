data
could
be
repurposed
in
different
ways
,
so
it
could
be
reused
for
entirely
different
things
.
and
we
're
finding
things
like
youtube
videos
can
be
used
to
determine
whether
somebody
has
parkinson
's
.
so
that
was
not
looking
at
speech
patterns
in
video
,
was
not
envisioned
at
collection
,
you
can
find
that
out
.
now
,
that
can
be
a
two
edge
sword
.
so
one
of
the
problems
with
data
sharing
especially
when
you
're
sharing
data
about
people
,
is
that
you
might
violate
privacy
and
confidentiality
.
it
can
be
very
difficult
to
allow
serendipitous
discovery
of
stuff
,
especially
with
rich
sources
like
video
or
social
networks
,
and
also
guarantee
that
no
one
will
ever
learn
anything
about
an
individual
from
that
data
source
.
besides
confidentiality
,
another
issue
that
somebody
could
prove
that
you
did
something
wrong
.
or
stupid
.
and
that
's
an
individual
disincentive
.
i
think
in
general
that
's
a
social
incentive
for
data
sharing
.
in
that
it
helps
with
error
correction
.
but
it
makes
,
from
an
individual
point
of
view
,
if
the
norm
is
not
to
share
,
that
may
disincent
you
from
sharing
,
because
you
could
be
proved
to
make
a
mistake
.
and
a
third
is
that
,
it
's
like
everything
else
,
it
takes
time
,
effort
.
for
a
lot
of
data
,
especially
things
in
the
social
sciences
,
traditional
surveys
and
stuff
,
the
amount
of
bits
,
the
size
of
the
bits
is
so
small
that
storage
costs
are
not
really
the
issue
.
but
for
some
new
forms
of
data
,
videos
,
social
networks
,
storage
costs
can
be
high
.
and
for
anything
,
what
you
have
to
do
to
document
instrument
etc
.
so
that
not
only
you
and
your
research
group
understands
it
,
but
everybody
else
who
's
in
a
particular
domain
can
understand
it
without
talking
to
you
,
is
going
to
be
more
.
that
's
capturing
that
tacit
knowledge
and
documenting
it
.
now
peculiarly
that
's
also
maybe
a
good
thing
from
a
scientific
practice
point
of
view
,
but
it
's
an
additional
cost
.

the
drawbacks
of
sharing
data
,
i
guess
i
would
think
of
them
more
as
considerations
in
sharing
data
.
because
i
think
that
,
really
,
we
should
be
sharing
data
.
we
may
have
to
delay
.
and
there
could
be
valid
reasons
for
delays
.
that
could
be
that
reasonably
the
researchers
who
spend
a
whole
lot
of
their
time
and
effort
in
creativity
and
getting
the
data
have
the
window
of
opportunity
to
publish
about
it
,
and
i
think
that
's
valid
.
one
of
the
things
we
did
at
icpsi
was
have
a
delayed
release
,
so
you
deposit
it
right
away
,
there
is
a
three
year
window
in
which
the
researchers
can
do
what
they
need
to
do
.
and
at
that
point
its
agreed
upon
,
and
then
it
will
be
shared
.
if
you
wait
until
the
research
project
gets
to
that
point
,
very
often
the
data
preservation
can
be
less
easy
.
more
costly
.

well
i
do
n't
know
if
there
are
drawbacks
to
sharing
data
,
but
there
are
certainly
challenges
to
sharing
data
.
particularly
in
the
social
sciences
.
much
of
our
data
is
about
people
and
those
people
have
rights
to
privacy
and
rights
to
have
their
own
being
protected
by
us
as
researchers
.
often
subjects
exchange
their
data
with
the
assurance
that
they
will
be
protected
in
some
way
.
and
so
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
no
harm
as
we
're
doing
our
research
.
there
are
some
challenges
i
think
particularly
for
young
scholars
that
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
collecting
their
data
.
they
want
to
have
an
opportunity
to
do
their
research
,
publish
out
of
their
data
before
they
have
to
expose
it
to
the
rest
of
the
research
community
.
so
there
are
challenges
like
that
in
the
process
of
sharing
data
,
but
i
do
n't
think
those
are
reasons
not
to
share
data
.
i
think
those
are
just
issues
that
have
to
be
managed
as
we
try
to
be
more
open
about
the
science
that
we
're
conducting
.
