now
that
we
have
familiarized
ourselves
with
key
definitions
,
let
's
move
on
to
the
laws
that
govern
and
regulate
how
confidential
information
is
managed
and
a
subject
's
privacy
is
protected
.
we
're
going
to
focus
on
laws
in
the
united
states
,
but
different
countries
have
different
laws
related
to
the
handling
of
confidential
information
.
researchers
should
familiarize
themselves
with
all
applicable
laws
prior
to
collecting
confidential
information
.
we
're
going
to
cover
three
of
the
big
laws
that
effect
confidentiality
in
the
united
states
.
mainly
,
the
common
rule
,
ferpa
,
and
hipaa
.
the
federal
policy
for
the
protection
of
human
subjects
,
known
as
the
common
rule
,
governs
human
subjects
research
that
is
conducted
or
supported
by
any
federal
department
or
agency
.
the
common
rule
establishes
institutional
review
boards
,
irbs
,
as
the
entities
that
oversee
the
ethical
treatment
of
human
subjects
in
research
.
the
common
rule
also
establishes
requirements
and
protocols
for
gaining
informed
consent
from
human
subjects
.
and
establishes
rules
for
the
protection
of
confidentiality
.
ferpa
or
the
family
educational
rights
and
privacy
act
applies
to
educational
data
.
and
establishes
a
student
's
right
of
privacy
for
their
educational
records
.
this
includes
personally
identifiable
information
maintained
by
educational
agencies
or
institutions
that
receive
funds
under
an
applicable
program
from
the
us
department
of
education
.
pii
in
this
case
includes
both
direct
and
indirect
identifiers
.
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
,
or
hipaa
privacy
rule
,
protects
phi
held
or
transmitted
by
a
covered
entity
.
and
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
provides
detailed
guidance
on
de-identification
methods
.
in
order
to
encourage
the
dissemination
of
data
.
the
hipaa
privacy
rule
provides
two
main
methods
for
de-identification
.
the
expert
determination
method
,
allows
the
person
with
appropriate
knowledge
to
apply
statistical
methods
to
de-identify
a
data
set
and
then
determine
that
the
risk
of
disclosure
to
an
individual
is
very
small
.
the
expert
must
also
document
the
methods
and
results
that
lead
to
this
determination
.
the
safe
harbor
method
stipulates
the
removal
of
18
types
of
identifiers
.
the
18
identifiers
include
direct
and
geographical
identifiers
.
and
the
final
identifier
in
the
list
is
in
many
ways
a
catch
all
for
those
indirect
identifiers
that
may
be
problematic
.
because
of
the
clarity
of
the
safe
harbor
method
,
it
has
also
been
adopted
in
other
areas
as
a
standard
method
for
de-identification
where
laws
and
procedures
may
be
less
clear
.
the
inter-university
consortium
for
political
and
social
research
,
or
icpsr
,
also
has
information
on
methods
for
protecting
confidentiality
in
their
guide
to
social
science
data
preparation
and
archiving
which
we
will
now
describe
.
the
most
straight
forward
method
is
completely
removing
the
problematic
variables
.
however
,
this
could
negatively
affect
the
usability
of
the
data
set
for
secondary
analysis
.
fortunately
,
there
are
alternative
approaches
that
may
be
used
for
handling
indirect
identifiers
within
a
data
set
.
first
is
top-coding
,
which
involves
restricting
the
upper
range
of
a
variable
that
may
identify
outliers
or
unique
individuals
.
second
is
collapsing
or
combining
.
where
you
combine
values
into
a
single
variable
or
merging
data
from
two
or
more
variables
into
one
summary
variable
.
third
is
sampling
,
where
you
release
a
randomized
sample
of
the
larger
original
data
set
that
provides
analysis
results
comparable
to
the
original
.
fourth
is
swapping
,
where
you
use
an
indirect
identifier
to
match
unique
cases
.
then
swapping
values
of
key
variables
between
those
cases
.
and
finally
,
there
is
disturbing
the
data
.
where
you
manipulate
the
data
by
adding
random
variation
in
the
value
while
maintaining
their
statistical
properties
.
when
it
comes
to
qualitative
data
,
anonymizing
data
is
best
done
using
a
pre-planned
anonymization
scheme
.
an
anonymization
scheme
describes
modifications
to
the
qualitative
dataset
to
protect
respondent
confidentiality
.
for
example
,
a
proper
name
should
be
replaced
with
more
generalized
text
that
describes
the
demographic
of
the
individual
or
the
person
's
relationship
with
the
respondent
.
specific
dates
,
especially
birth
dates
or
important
events
,
will
also
need
to
be
replaced
with
general
markers
.
other
types
of
information
that
would
uniquely
identify
a
respondent
may
have
to
be
redacted
or
removed
completely
.
in
this
case
,
a
marker
should
indicate
that
an
item
was
removed
from
the
data
set
.
these
are
just
some
strategies
that
are
used
today
to
protect
confidentiality
through
anonymization
.
there
are
other
strategies
that
are
currently
being
developed
to
protect
confidential
data
.
however
,
the
most
common
strategy
currently
remains
to
anonymize
data
by
removing
variables
,
applying
statistical
techniques
,
or
redacting
information
to
lessen
the
potential
for
identifying
an
individual
.
to
determine
the
best
strategy
for
anonymizing
data
to
maximize
usability
,
a
researcher
should
consider
future
research
questions
and
carefully
consider
a
variable
's
analytic
importance
.
it
may
also
be
useful
to
consult
your
institutional
review
board
,
statistical
experts
,
or
information
professionals
.
who
have
expertise
dealing
with
sensitive
or
confidential
data
.
