we discussed, 
there numerous benefits 
challenges to sharing research data 
variety stakeholders 
involved in data management 
heterogeneity data, 
access to data may vary based external 
limitations researchers needs 
challenges we discussed, 
data ownership issues 
data containing sensitive 
confidential information 
may also affect 
a researcher provides access 
well types 
restrictions placed data 
today we will begin discussing 
three types restrictions, 
limitations, that 
commonly placed data 
first embargos 
embargos a specified period time 
access to data will restricted 
embargos commonly last 
between to months 
often based rights first use 
researchers needs to sufficient 
time to publish using data 
prior to releasing publicly 
embargos also required 
stakeholders publishers 
however, funders may require 
that data made available in 
a timely fashion within a certain 
timeframe project completion, 
could limit length 
possible embargos 
another type restriction that may 
placed data is technological 
access restrictions based 
user affiliation requirements 
instance, data users may required 
to log in to a particular system 
authenticate relationship to 
an institution to access certain data 
restrictions may stipulate 
that membership required 
access, that a data user affiliated 
a certain research group 
institution, often due 
to licensing agreements 
final type restriction we 
will discuss is data use agreements 
a data use agreement explicitly 
outlines an agreement between 
data producer secondary data user 
may impose rules reuse, 
storage, redissemination disposal 
data use agreements commonly 
required data potential 
to identify human subjects 
either directly indirectly 
data user is required 
to sign a data use agreement 
review this document carefully 
comply 
aspects agreement, 
violations 
result in consequences 
ideally to optimize use researches 
make data open possible 
however, this may always feasible 
clearly outlining access 
restrictions within terms use 
applying a standard license positively 
impact potential reuse 
researchers discuss 
possible access restrictions 
licensing a repository 
choice to clarify needs 
also determine types licenses 
supported required repository 
while there multiple different ways 
methods to assign a license waiver 
to data, going to go 
a little depth one increasingly 
popular method, is assigning 
a standard creative commons license 
creative commons is a usbased nonprofit 
organization that a leader 
in developing legal tools 
sharing creative works 
internet since 
a creative commons license 
key benefits 
namely, provides a robust legal code 
provides a humanreadable summary 
that is understandable a glance 
provides 
a machinereadable layer code 
that help make resources 
interoperable across systems 
version, creative commons 
also conforms to copyright 
database laws applicable, 
is particularly important 
discussing licensing data 
there five main creative commons 
license categories 
distinctive logo 
abbreviation 
attribution requires that users 
credit creator a work 
noncommercial stipulates that a work 
cannot used commercial purposes 
derivative works states that you cannot 
alter, transform, build upon a work 
sharealike requires that if you alter, 
transform, build upon a work, 
if you distribute resulting work, 
you must assign an identical license 
finally, 
cc reserve rights, 
releases work public domain 
you will also see licenses that 
a combination categories 
instance, cc nc nd 
means you must attribute creator, 
work cannot used commercially, 
derivatives may 
created using work 
creative commons is an online 
tool that helps users select 
an appropriate license generate 
text to apply license to a work 
today, while groups, 
datasite recommend researchers 
apply a cc license to data sets to 
allow maximum freedom to reuse data 
this may possible 
in situations 
we discussed in this lesson 
researchers may to impose access 
restrictions certain data, 
take multiple forms, 
placing an embargo data to 
requiring a data use agreement 
however, in general, explaining 
restrictions within terms use 
applying a standard license, a researcher 
help enable informed reuse
