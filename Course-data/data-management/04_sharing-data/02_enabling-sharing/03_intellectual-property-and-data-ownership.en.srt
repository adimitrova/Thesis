2
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:11,592
One of the other areas that may be
problematic when a researcher wishes to

3
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:15,942
share his or her data, is resolving and
clarifying data ownership and

4
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,470
intellectual property rights issues.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,456
Intellectual property rights can be
defined as rights acquired over any work

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:28,530
created or invented with the intellectual
effort of an individual or entity.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,720
The question of how
intellectual property rights

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,600
relate to data in particular
can complicate this issue.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,040
As we have discussed, research data
can come in many different forms

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,200
which can affect whether data are subject
to intellectual property rights,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
different legal jurisdictions
may also apply.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,060
They have particular standards for
creative works, to data differently.

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,800
Because of these complexities,
in order to effectively share data,

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,420
researchers should first resolve
any data ownership issues.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,390
Resolving data ownership issues early,

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,190
is particularly important because
the person who has ownership over the data

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,770
ultimately controls its dissemination,
preservation, and destruction.

18
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,490
Ownership issues can become even more
problematic and confusing because

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,120
of the various stakeholders involved
in collecting and generating data.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,650
Today, collaborative projects, especially
cross institutional collaborations or

21
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,040
international collaborations
can complicate data ownership.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,260
For this reason, it is important for

23
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,650
researchers to come to an agreement
at the beginning of a project.

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,650
Concerning how, when, and
by whom the data will be used

25
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,530
as the basis of publications as
well as shared in the future.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,240
Institutional policies can
also influence data ownership.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,070
In some cases,
if a researcher is working for

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,010
a university, then the data may
technically be owned by the institution.

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,710
Researchers should be cognizant of
institutional data management and

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,540
copyright policies when
considering data sharing.

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,610
It is important that researchers
contact their institution

32
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,709
if they are unsure about their
intellectual property rights.

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,600
Funders may have policies related to
ownership rights of data that stipulate

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,320
where and how a researcher
should share their data or

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,570
impose restrictions on data dissemination.

36
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,590
So being aware of funder
policies is also essential.

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,870
In the case of using
extant proprietary data,

38
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,570
researchers are often required to gain
permission from the producer of the data

39
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,770
in order to legally share the original or
derived data.

40
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,960
Because of the many stakeholders and

41
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,475
policies that can affect data ownership,
researchers may be confused

42
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:13,185
over who actually owns the data which may
make them reticent to share the data.

43
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:17,134
We encourage researchers
to contact information and

44
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:21,609
legal professionals early in
the research data lifecycle,

45
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,886
to assist them in determining what
polices may affect data ownership.
