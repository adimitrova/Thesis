in
this
lesson
,
we
're
going
to
further
examine
some
of
the
data
sharing
challenges
that
we
have
briefly
touched
upon
and
discuss
some
strategies
for
overcoming
these
challenges
.
by
the
end
of
this
lesson
,
we
'll
understand
what
is
confidential
information
,
be
aware
of
strategies
for
anonymizing
data
,
understand
how
data
ownership
can
affect
data
sharing
,
be
aware
of
the
types
of
access
restrictions
that
may
be
placed
on
data
,
and
know
how
to
apply
a
standard
license
to
data
,
to
encourage
sharing
and
reuse
.
when
collecting
data
that
deal
with
human
subjects
,
researchers
have
an
ethical
requirement
to
protect
the
privacy
of
study
participants
.
this
involves
protecting
an
individual
's
identity
during
the
collection
,
handling
,
storage
,
and
sharing
of
data
.
often
these
ethical
considerations
are
outlined
in
a
researcher
's
application
to
their
institutional
review
board
,
or
irb
.
there
can
be
serious
consequences
of
confidentiality
is
accidentally
breached
.
these
consequences
can
negatively
effect
a
researcher
's
career
.
negatively
impact
a
research
's
institution
,
and
may
include
hefty
fines
or
even
legal
sanctions
.
today
,
the
news
is
full
of
horror
stories
of
data
breaches
that
may
arise
from
careless
data
management
practices
.
in
order
to
avoid
these
situations
a
researcher
needs
to
think
carefully
during
the
data
management
planning
phase
about
what
confidential
information
they
may
collect
.
if
the
data
will
be
de-identified
and
how
or
if
they
will
share
the
data
at
the
conclusion
of
the
research
project
?
so
what
are
the
types
of
information
that
need
to
be
protected
?
first
there
is
personally
identifiable
information
,
or
pii
.
pii
is
defined
as
any
representation
of
information
that
permits
the
identity
of
an
individual
to
whom
the
information
applies
to
be
reasonably
inferred
by
either
direct
or
indirect
means
.
note
the
reference
to
either
direct
or
indirect
means
.
we
will
come
back
to
this
idea
in
a
moment
.
next
,
we
have
protected
health
information
or
phi
.
phi
is
individually
identifiable
health
information
transmitted
or
maintained
,
in
any
form
or
medium
,
by
a
covered
entity
.
and
finally
there
is
sensitive
information
.
which
is
information
,
that
if
disclosed
there
is
a
significant
likelihood
of
psychological
,
social
,
emotional
,
physical
or
reputational
harm
.
these
definitions
show
the
breadth
of
information
that
researchers
need
to
actively
protect
when
managing
and
potentially
sharing
data
.
now
let
's
look
at
three
type
of
identifiers
.
as
we
mentioned
above
,
there
are
both
direct
and
indirect
ways
a
person
can
be
identified
.
direct
identifiers
are
those
variables
or
information
included
within
data
that
explicitly
point
to
an
individual
or
unit
.
these
include
,
social
security
numbers
,
phone
numbers
,
and
names
,
and
are
often
the
easy
ones
to
spot
.
the
identifiers
that
can
become
more
problematic
are
the
indirect
identifiers
.
these
are
variables
that
may
make
unique
cases
visible
,
particularly
when
combined
with
other
individual
attributes
,
such
as
race
or
income
.
finally
,
we
have
geographic
identifiers
.
which
may
include
indirect
identifiers
such
as
a
zip
code
or
direct
identifiers
such
as
a
complete
mailing
address
.
consider
an
example
data
set
in
which
direct
identifiers
have
been
removed
.
the
data
set
represents
the
population
of
us
citizens
,
who
have
earned
doctoral
degrees
in
1991.
variables
include
the
major
field
of
study
,
race
,
sex
and
geographic
region
of
the
academic
institution
in
which
the
degree
was
earned
.
without
direct
identifiers
such
as
name
,
phone
number
,
mailing
address
,
social
security
number
,
and
other
information
that
link
directly
to
the
identity
of
the
individual
it
would
seem
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
distinguish
any
given
individual
represented
in
this
data
set
which
includes
over
25,000
people
.
let
's
take
a
closer
look
at
these
data
.
if
we
were
to
take
just
the
people
who
earned
their
doctoral
degrees
in
the
science
and
engineering
fields
,
we
are
left
with
just
over
14,000
individuals
.
of
those
individuals
,
2,119
received
their
degrees
in
the
physical
sciences
1,707
of
which
are
male
.
of
that
group
,
only
20
reported
their
race
as
black
.
having
quickly
gone
from
over
25,000
people
to
just
20
,
how
easy
do
you
think
it
would
be
to
figure
out
who
those
20
people
are
?
well
,
only
eight
of
them
were
astronomy
majors
it
would
n't
take
much
more
information
to
identify
at
least
one
of
these
individuals
.
if
we
knew
where
those
degrees
were
granted
,
say
in
new
york
,
we
would
likely
know
who
that
person
is
.
this
example
demonstrates
that
protecting
confidentiality
requires
careful
consideration
and
special
handling
of
not
only
direct
identifiers
,
but
also
indirect
identifiers
.
