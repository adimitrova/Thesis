2
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:09,719
As we have discussed,
there are numerous benefits and

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,300
challenges to sharing research data.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,150
Because of the variety of stakeholders
involved in data management and

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,270
the heterogeneity of data,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,460
access to data may vary based on external
limitations or researchers' needs.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,280
Some of the challenges we discussed,
such as data ownership issues or

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,440
data containing sensitive or
confidential information

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,790
may also affect how and
where a researcher provides access.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,790
As well as the types of
restrictions placed on the data.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,840
Today we will begin by discussing
three types of restrictions, or

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,370
limitations, that
are commonly placed on data.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,340
First are embargos.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,690
Embargos are a specified period of time
when access to data will be restricted.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,080
Embargos commonly last
between 6 to 24 months.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,210
And are often based on rights of first use
or researchers needs to have sufficient

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,050
time to publish using their data
prior to releasing them publicly.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,169
Embargos can also be required by other
stakeholders such as publishers.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,890
However, funders may require
that data be made available in

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,510
a timely fashion or within a certain
time-frame after the project completion,

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,030
which could limit the length
of possible embargos.

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,550
Another type of restriction that may
be placed on data is technological

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,430
access restrictions based on
user affiliation requirements.

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,712
For instance, data users may be required
to log in to a particular system and

25
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:58,150
authenticate the relationship to
an institution to access certain data.

26
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,890
These restrictions may stipulate
that membership be required for

27
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,980
access, or that a data user be affiliated
with a certain research group or

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,240
institution, often due
to licensing agreements.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,982
The final type of restriction we
will discuss is data use agreements.

30
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:20,613
A data use agreement explicitly
outlines an agreement between

31
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,854
the data producer and secondary data user.

32
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:30,970
And may impose rules for reuse,
storage, re-dissemination and disposal.

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,310
Data use agreements are commonly
required when data have the potential

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,670
to identify human subjects
either directly or indirectly.

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,500
Any data user who is required
to sign a data use agreement

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,030
should review this document carefully.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,120
And comply with all
aspects of the agreement,

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,720
because violations can
result in consequences.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,340
Ideally to optimize for use researches
should make data as open as possible.

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,590
However, this may not always be feasible.

41
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,370
Clearly outlining any access
restrictions within the terms of use and

42
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,830
applying a standard license can positively
impact the potential for reuse.

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,610
Researchers should discuss
possible access restrictions and

44
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,440
licensing with a repository of
choice to clarify their needs.

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,790
And also determine the types of licenses
supported or required by the repository.

46
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,020
While there are multiple different ways
and methods to assign a license or waiver

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,510
to data, we're going to go into
a little more depth on one increasingly

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,860
popular method, which is assigning
a standard Creative Commons license.

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,605
Creative Commons is a US-based non-profit

50
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:53,330
organization that has been a leader
in developing legal tools for

51
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,100
sharing creative works over
the Internet since the 2000s.

52
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,520
A Creative Commons license
has some key benefits.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,690
Namely, it provides a robust legal code.

54
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,890
It provides a human-readable summary
that is understandable at a glance.

55
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,960
And it provides
a machine-readable layer of code

56
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,496
that can help make resources
interoperable across systems.

57
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:21,530
Under the 4.0 version, Creative Commons

58
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,760
also conforms to both copyright and
database laws where applicable,

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,570
which is particularly important
when discussing licensing data.

60
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,040
There are five main Creative Commons
license categories.

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,850
Each has its own distinctive logo and
abbreviation.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,650
Attribution requires that users
credit the creator of a work.

63
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,719
NonCommercial stipulates that a work
cannot be used for commercial purposes.

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,940
No Derivative Works states that you cannot
alter, transform, or build upon a work.

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,570
ShareAlike requires that if you alter,
transform, or build upon a work,

66
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,548
then if you distribute the resulting work,
you must assign an identical license.

67
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:14,450
And finally,
CC0 does not reserve any rights, and

68
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,770
releases the work into the public domain.

69
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,704
You will also see licenses that
are a combination of these categories.

70
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:26,530
For instance, CC BY NC ND

71
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,290
means you must attribute the creator,
the work cannot be used commercially, and

72
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,920
no derivatives may be
created using the work.

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,066
Creative Commons is an online
tool that helps users select

74
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:43,241
an appropriate license and generate
text to apply the license to a work.

75
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:48,983
Today, while some groups,
such as DataSite recommend researchers

76
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:55,328
apply a CC0 license to data sets to
allow maximum freedom to reuse the data.

77
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,749
This may not be possible
in all situations.

78
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:03,393
As we discussed in this lesson
researchers may have to impose access

79
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:07,792
restrictions on certain data,
which can take multiple forms,

80
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:13,160
from placing an embargo on data to
requiring a data use agreement.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,196
However, in general, by explaining
restrictions within the terms of use and

82
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:25,147
applying a standard license, a researcher
can help enable informed reuse.

83
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:34,019
