2
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:10,166
In this lesson, we're going to further
examine some of the data sharing

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,479
challenges that we have briefly touched
upon and discuss some strategies for

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,810
overcoming these challenges.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,660
By the end of this lesson,

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,190
we'll understand what is confidential
information, be aware of strategies for

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,740
anonymizing data, understand how data
ownership can affect data sharing,

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,260
be aware of the types of access
restrictions that may be placed on data,

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,559
and know how to apply a standard license
to data, to encourage sharing and reuse.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,120
When collecting data that
deal with human subjects,

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,530
researchers have an ethical requirement to
protect the privacy of study participants.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,830
This involves protecting an individual's
identity during the collection,

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,100
handling, storage, and sharing of data.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,280
Often these ethical considerations
are outlined in a researcher's application

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,840
to their institutional review board,
or IRB.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,520
There can be serious consequences of
confidentiality is accidentally breached.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,450
These consequences can negatively
effect a researcher's career.

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,270
Negatively impact
a research's institution, and

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,510
may include hefty fines or
even legal sanctions.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,670
Today, the news is full of horror stories

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,450
of data breaches that may arise from
careless data management practices.

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,850
In order to avoid these
situations a researcher

23
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,610
needs to think carefully during
the data management planning phase

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,430
about what confidential
information they may collect.

25
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,040
If the data will be de-identified and
how or

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,660
if they will share the data at
the conclusion of the research project?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,550
So what are the types of information
that need to be protected?

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,100
First there is Personally
Identifiable Information, or PII.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,730
PII is defined as any
representation of information

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,840
that permits the identity of an individual
to whom the information applies

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,660
to be reasonably inferred by
either direct or indirect means.

32
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,940
Note the reference to either direct or
indirect means.

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,070
We will come back to
this idea in a moment.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,100
Next, we have
Protected Health Information or PHI.

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,070
PHI is individually identifiable
health information transmitted or

36
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,280
maintained, in any form or
medium, by a covered entity.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,020
And finally there is
sensitive information.

38
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,720
Which is information, that if disclosed
there is a significant likelihood of

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,740
psychological, social, emotional,
physical or reputational harm.

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,920
These definitions show the breadth of
information that researchers need to

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,890
actively protect when managing and
potentially sharing data.

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,130
Now let's look at three
type of identifiers.

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,880
As we mentioned above,
there are both direct and

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,130
indirect ways a person can be identified.

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,490
Direct identifiers are those variables or

46
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,880
information included within data that
explicitly point to an individual or unit.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,740
These include, Social Security numbers,
phone numbers, and

48
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,490
names, and
are often the easy ones to spot.

49
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,210
The identifiers that can become more
problematic are the indirect identifiers.

50
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,910
These are variables that may make
unique cases visible, particularly

51
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,790
when combined with other individual
attributes, such as race or income.

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,720
Finally, we have geographic identifiers.

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,750
Which may include indirect
identifiers such as a Zip Code or

54
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,080
direct identifiers such as
a complete mailing address.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,460
Consider an example data set in which
direct identifiers have been removed.

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,640
The data set represents
the population of US citizens,

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,390
who have earned doctoral degrees in 1991.

58
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,460
Variables include the major field
of study, race, sex and geographic

59
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,440
region of the academic institution
in which the degree was earned.

60
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,810
Without direct identifiers such as name,
phone number,

61
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,280
mailing address,
Social Security Number, and

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,820
other information that link directly
to the identity of the individual

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,530
it would seem that it would be impossible
to distinguish any given individual

64
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,139
represented in this data set which
includes over 25,000 people.

65
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,110
Let's take a closer look at these data.

66
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,170
If we were to take just the people
who earned their doctoral degrees in

67
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,480
the science and engineering fields, we are
left with just over 14,000 individuals.

68
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Of those individuals,
2,119 received their degrees in

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,510
the physical sciences
1,707 of which are male.

70
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,830
Of that group,
only 20 reported their race as black.

71
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,510
Having quickly gone from over
25,000 people to just 20,

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,180
how easy do you think it would be to
figure out who those 20 people are?

73
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,270
Well, only eight of them were astronomy
majors it wouldn't take much more

74
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,620
information to identify at
least one of these individuals.

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,352
If we knew where those
degrees were granted,

76
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:48,081
say in New York,
we would likely know who that person is.

77
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:53,152
This example demonstrates that
protecting confidentiality requires

78
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:58,730
careful consideration and special
handling of not only direct identifiers,

79
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,105
but also indirect identifiers.

80
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:09,819
