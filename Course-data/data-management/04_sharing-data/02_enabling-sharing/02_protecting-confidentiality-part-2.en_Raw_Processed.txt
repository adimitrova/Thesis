music 
that we familiarized 
key definitions, 
lets move to laws that govern 
regulate confidential 
information is managed 
a subjects privacy is protected 
going to focus laws in 
united states, different countries 
different laws related to 
handling confidential information 
researchers familiarize 
applicable laws prior to 
collecting confidential information 
going to cover three big laws 
that effect confidentiality 
in united states 
mainly, common rule, ferpa, hipaa 
federal policy 
protection human subjects, 
known common rule, governs human 
subjects research that is conducted 
supported federal department 
agency 
common rule establishes 
institutional review boards, irbs, 
entities that oversee ethical 
treatment human subjects in research 
common rule also 
establishes requirements 
protocols gaining informed 
consent human subjects 
establishes rules 
protection confidentiality 
ferpa family educational rights 
privacy act applies to educational data 
establishes a students right 
privacy educational records 
this includes personally identifiable 
information maintained 
educational agencies 
institutions that receive funds 
an applicable program 
us department education 
pii in this case includes direct 
indirect identifiers 
health insurance portability 
accountability act, hipaa privacy rule, 
protects phi held 
transmitted a covered entity 
department health 
human services provides detailed 
guidance deidentification methods 
in order to encourage 
dissemination data 
hipaa privacy rule provides two 
main methods deidentification 
expert determination method, allows 
person appropriate knowledge 
to apply statistical methods 
to deidentify a data set 
determine that risk disclosure 
to an individual is small 
expert must also 
document methods 
results that lead to this determination 
safe harbor method stipulates 
removal types identifiers 
identifiers include direct 
geographical identifiers 
final identifier in list 
is in many ways a catch 
indirect identifiers 
that may problematic 
clarity 
safe harbor method, 
also adopted in 
areas a standard method 
deidentification laws 
procedures may less clear 
interuniversity consortium 
political social research, icpsr, 
also information methods 
protecting confidentiality in guide 
to social science data preparation 
archiving we will describe 
straight forward method 
is completely removing 
problematic variables 
however, this could negatively affect 
usability data set 
secondary analysis 
fortunately, there alternative 
approaches that may used 
handling indirect identifiers 
within a data set 
first is topcoding, 
involves restricting upper 
range a variable that may identify 
outliers unique individuals 
second is collapsing combining 
you combine values a single 
variable merging data two 
variables one summary variable 
third is sampling, you release 
a randomized sample larger 
original data set that provides analysis 
results comparable to original 
fourth is swapping, you use an 
indirect identifier to match unique cases 
swapping values key 
variables between cases 
finally, there is disturbing data 
you manipulate data 
adding random variation in 
value while maintaining 
statistical properties 
comes to qualitative data, 
anonymizing data is best 
done using a preplanned 
anonymization scheme 
an anonymization scheme 
describes modifications 
to qualitative dataset to 
protect respondent confidentiality 
example, a proper name 
replaced generalized text 
that describes demographic 
individual 
persons relationship 
respondent 
specific dates, especially birth dates 
important events, will also need to 
replaced general markers 
types information that 
would uniquely identify a respondent 
may to redacted 
removed completely 
in this case, 
a marker indicate that an item 
removed data set 
strategies 
that used today 
to protect confidentiality 
anonymization 
there strategies that 
currently developed 
to protect confidential data 
however, common strategy 
currently remains to anonymize 
data removing variables, 
applying statistical techniques, 
redacting information to lessen 
potential identifying an individual 
to determine best strategy 
anonymizing data to maximize usability, 
a researcher consider 
future research questions 
carefully consider a variables 
analytic importance 
may also useful to consult 
institutional review board, 
statistical experts, 
information professionals 
expertise dealing 
sensitive confidential data
