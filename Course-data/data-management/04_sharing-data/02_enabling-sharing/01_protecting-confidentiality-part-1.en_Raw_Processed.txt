in this lesson, going to 
examine data sharing 
challenges that we briefly touched 
upon discuss strategies 
overcoming challenges 
end this lesson, 
well understand is confidential 
information, aware strategies 
anonymizing data, understand data 
ownership affect data sharing, 
aware types access 
restrictions that may placed data, 
know to apply a standard license 
to data, to encourage sharing reuse 
collecting data that 
deal human subjects, 
researchers an ethical requirement to 
protect privacy study participants 
this involves protecting an individuals 
identity collection, 
handling, storage, sharing data 
often ethical considerations 
outlined in a researchers application 
to institutional review board, 
irb 
there serious consequences 
confidentiality is accidentally breached 
consequences negatively 
effect a researchers career 
negatively impact 
a researchs institution, 
may include hefty fines 
even legal sanctions 
today, news is full horror stories 
data breaches that may arise 
careless data management practices 
in order to avoid 
situations a researcher 
needs to think carefully 
data management planning phase 
confidential 
information may collect 
if data will deidentified 

if will share data 
conclusion research project 
so types information 
that need to protected 
first there is personally 
identifiable information, pii 
pii is defined 
representation information 
that permits identity an individual 
to information applies 
to reasonably inferred 
either direct indirect means 
note reference to either direct 
indirect means 
we will come back to 
this idea in a moment 
next, we 
protected health information phi 
phi is individually identifiable 
health information transmitted 
maintained, in form 
medium, a covered entity 
finally there is 
sensitive information 
is information, that if disclosed 
there is a significant likelihood 
psychological, social, emotional, 
physical reputational harm 
definitions show breadth 
information that researchers need to 
actively protect managing 
potentially sharing data 
lets look three 
type identifiers 
we mentioned above, 
there direct 
indirect ways a person identified 
direct identifiers variables 
information included within data that 
explicitly point to an individual unit 
include, social security numbers, 
phone numbers, 
names, 
often easy ones to spot 
identifiers that become 
problematic indirect identifiers 
variables that may make 
unique cases visible, particularly 
combined individual 
attributes, race income 
finally, we geographic identifiers 
may include indirect 
identifiers a zip code 
direct identifiers 
a complete mailing address 
consider an example data set in 
direct identifiers removed 
data set represents 
population us citizens, 
earned doctoral degrees in 
variables include major field 
study, race, sex geographic 
region academic institution 
in degree earned 
without direct identifiers name, 
phone number, 
mailing address, 
social security number, 
information that link directly 
to identity individual 
would seem that would impossible 
to distinguish given individual 
represented in this data set 
includes , people 
lets take a closer look data 
if we to take people 
earned doctoral degrees in 
science engineering fields, we 
left , individuals 
individuals, 
, received degrees in 
physical sciences 
, male 
that group, 
reported race black 
quickly gone 
, people to , 
easy you think would to 
figure people 
well, eight astronomy 
majors wouldnt take much 
information to identify 
least one individuals 
if we knew 
degrees granted, 
say in new york, 
we would likely know that person is 
this example demonstrates that 
protecting confidentiality requires 
careful consideration special 
handling direct identifiers, 
also indirect identifiers
