2
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:10,481
Now that we have familiarized
ourselves with key definitions,

3
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:15,361
let's move on to the laws that govern and
regulate how confidential

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:20,000
information is managed and
a subject's privacy is protected.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,550
We're going to focus on laws in
the United States, but different countries

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,150
have different laws related to
the handling of confidential information.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,870
Researchers should familiarize themselves

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,260
with all applicable laws prior to
collecting confidential information.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,710
We're going to cover three of the big laws

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,630
that effect confidentiality
in the United States.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,272
Mainly, the Common Rule, FERPA, and HIPAA.

12
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:55,810
The Federal Policy for
the Protection of Human Subjects,

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,740
known as the Common Rule, Governs human
subjects research that is conducted or

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,230
supported by any federal department or
agency.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,959
The common rule establishes
institutional review boards, IRBs,

16
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:18,000
as the entities that oversee the ethical
treatment of human subjects in research.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,640
The Common Rule also
establishes requirements and

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,510
protocols for gaining informed
consent from human subjects.

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,370
And establishes rules for
the protection of confidentiality.

20
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,590
FERPA or the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act applies to educational data.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,280
And establishes a student's right of
privacy for their educational records.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,800
This includes personally identifiable
information maintained by

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,010
educational agencies or
institutions that receive funds

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,060
under an applicable program from
the US Department of Education.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,110
PII in this case includes both direct and
indirect identifiers.

26
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,580
The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, or HIPAA Privacy Rule,

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,380
protects PHI held or
transmitted by a covered entity.

28
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,770
And the Department of Health and

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,170
Human Services provides detailed
guidance on de-identification methods.

30
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,680
In order to encourage
the dissemination of data.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,630
The HIPAA privacy rule provides two
main methods for de-identification.

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,540
The expert determination method, allows
the person with appropriate knowledge

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,590
to apply statistical methods
to de-identify a data set and

34
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,540
then determine that the risk of disclosure
to an individual is very small.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,940
The expert must also
document the methods and

36
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,180
results that lead to this determination.

37
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,060
The Safe Harbor Method stipulates
the removal of 18 types of identifiers.

38
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,570
The 18 identifiers include direct and
geographical identifiers.

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,760
And the final identifier in the list
is in many ways a catch all for

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,450
those indirect identifiers
that may be problematic.

41
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,550
Because of the clarity of
the Safe Harbor Method,

42
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,055
it has also been adopted in other
areas as a standard method for

43
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:24,130
de-identification where laws and
procedures may be less clear.

44
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,230
The Inter-University Consortium for
Political and Social Research, or ICPSR,

45
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,220
also has information on methods for
protecting confidentiality in their guide

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,590
to social science data preparation and
archiving which we will now describe.

47
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,150
The most straight forward method

48
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,420
is completely removing
the problematic variables.

49
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,490
However, this could negatively affect
the usability of the data set for

50
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,840
secondary analysis.

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,750
Fortunately, there are alternative
approaches that may be used for

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,908
handling indirect identifiers
within a data set.

53
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:10,880
First is top-coding,
which involves restricting the upper

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,790
range of a variable that may identify
outliers or unique individuals.

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,510
Second is collapsing or combining.

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,400
Where you combine values into a single
variable or merging data from two or

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,070
more variables into one summary variable.

58
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,770
Third is sampling, where you release
a randomized sample of the larger

59
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,470
original data set that provides analysis
results comparable to the original.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,470
Fourth is swapping, where you use an
indirect identifier to match unique cases.

61
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,610
Then swapping values of key
variables between those cases.

62
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,410
And finally, there is disturbing the data.

63
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,420
Where you manipulate the data
by adding random variation in

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,680
the value while maintaining
their statistical properties.

65
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,880
When it comes to qualitative data,
anonymizing data is best

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,620
done using a pre-planned
anonymization scheme.

67
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,520
An anonymization scheme
describes modifications

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,940
to the qualitative dataset to
protect respondent confidentiality.

69
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,960
For example, a proper name should be
replaced with more generalized text

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,290
that describes the demographic
of the individual or

71
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,260
the person's relationship
with the respondent.

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,430
Specific dates, especially birth dates or

73
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,730
important events, will also need to
be replaced with general markers.

74
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,720
Other types of information that
would uniquely identify a respondent

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,190
may have to be redacted or
removed completely.

76
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,150
In this case,

77
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,350
a marker should indicate that an item
was removed from the data set.

78
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,980
These are just some strategies
that are used today

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,050
to protect confidentiality
through anonymization.

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,680
There are other strategies that
are currently being developed

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,290
to protect confidential data.

82
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,470
However, the most common strategy
currently remains to anonymize

83
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,590
data by removing variables,
applying statistical techniques, or

84
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,390
redacting information to lessen the
potential for identifying an individual.

85
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,690
To determine the best strategy for
anonymizing data to maximize usability,

86
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,420
a researcher should consider
future research questions and

87
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,320
carefully consider a variable's
analytic importance.

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,770
It may also be useful to consult
your institutional review board,

89
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,527
statistical experts, or
information professionals.

90
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:54,403
Who have expertise dealing with
sensitive or confidential data.

91
00:06:54,403 --> 00:07:00,929
