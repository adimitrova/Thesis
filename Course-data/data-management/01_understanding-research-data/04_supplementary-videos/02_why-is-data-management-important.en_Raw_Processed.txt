important to, 
you start designing a study 
an experiment an observation, 
to think how, 
you going to data 
youre going to collecting, right 
youre going to producing 
so, if this becomes part already 
design you a, 
you think longterm accessibility 
that data, preservation that data, 
already you that in mind 
youre building study or, 
again, experiment 
then, there 
chances that you make it, 
that will easier 
you to make accessible to others 
so, students in discipline least, 
i mean, 
need to aware that data management 
is a critical part do, 
will do, either practicing 
engineers scientists 
researchers 
its, 
you need to able to 
keep track data 
keep track different 
changes youve made to data 
able to, if you get sued 
example, an engineer 
you need to show calculations 
you need to able to manage that 
information, able to show 
so, i see there practical 
symbolic benefits 
practical benefits i think are, 
theres a plot 
theres a plan, cradle to grave 
is research question 
data used 
to address that question 
there aspects research 
project that required, required 
data is there, archiving requirement 
future use, sorts things 
so thats birth data, 
growth it, 
final archiving 
a practical way to begin 
is going to a bunch work 
symbolic part, is a reason, 
a focus people to talk 
i think theres a sense, i certainly 
get sense in libraries that 
people feel like we a completely 
known set data management practices 
i dont believe we 
i think a lot domains 
practices still emerging 
so, i think that we really 
open to identifying new kinds 
data management practices, figuring 
role might in 
you need to a digital librarian 
to organization data 
you need to a social 
scientist come 
help you to arrange things, 
to share things 
you need to sort 
a policy maven come 
say type policies you need 
type working together, 
sharing, collaboration 
things like that 
so, in a sense, you need multiple 
communities together to form your, 
you call, a scientific fabric 
you multiple people to come 
read that
