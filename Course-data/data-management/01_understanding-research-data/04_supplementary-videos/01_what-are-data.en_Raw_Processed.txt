preservation perspective, 
data mean digital 
information kind, 
including specific 
outcomes research 
so structured data, research experiments, 
things like that 
data observable 
bits information that 
help us understand a political process, 
a social process, an economic behavior, 
whatever is that people 
data is that observable bit 
information that we record 
later analyze to help 
understand processes 
data is evidence used research 
scholarly academic research kind

world 
anything in it, youre relying 
evidence that statement

youre probably referring to 
a particular piece text somewhere 
if you say people in 
united states like vanilla ice cream, 
theres probably 
evidence underlying that 
theyre both, 
data if theyre used evidence
