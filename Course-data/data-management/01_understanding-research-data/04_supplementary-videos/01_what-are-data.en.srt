00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,038
I define data very broadly.

3
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:13,047
I think it's from a digital
preservation perspective,

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:17,219
data can mean digital
information of any kind,

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,910
including very specific
outcomes of research.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,890
So structured data, research experiments,
and things like that.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,950
>> Data are those observable
bits of information that

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,540
help us understand a political process,

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,230
a social process, an economic behavior,
whatever it is that people are doing.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,180
The data is that observable bit of
information that we can record and

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,360
later analyze to help
understand those processes.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,050
>> Data is evidence used for research and

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,620
scholarly academic research of any kind.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,990
So when you make a statement
about the world or

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:07,140
about anything in it, you're relying
on some evidence for that statement.

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,390
If you say Proust has a wonderful passage,

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,120
you're probably referring to
a particular piece of text somewhere.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,048
If you say 95% of the people in
the United States like vanilla ice cream,

19
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:27,990
then there's probably some
evidence underlying that.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,320
They're both, they both can be
data if they're used as evidence.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,799

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,770
>> Typically, there are multiple types
of data that are being collected.

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,110
The data are almost entirely
numeric that I deal with.

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,826
I don't really deal with

25
00:01:55,826 --> 00:02:00,322
images or maps or text.

26
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:06,313
And it's all strange, collected for
the purpose primarily of research,

27
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:12,179
not collected, say for health claims or
for other secondary purposes.

28
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:16,210
>> My data in my research,
some of it is simulated data,

29
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,890
some of it is survey data, some of it is
data produced by government agencies.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,890
It's really all kinds,
sometimes experimental data,

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,990
most of it is observational data,
data that comes from the world as

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,970
it occurs rather than in
a controlled laboratory.

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,740
But really, all different types of
data are part of what I look at.

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,620
I'm more interested in the question
that I'm trying to answer,

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,300
then I go find the data that I need.
