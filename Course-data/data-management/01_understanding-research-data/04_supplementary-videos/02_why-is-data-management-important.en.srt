2
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:08,902
>> It's important to,
as you start designing a study or

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:12,474
an experiment or an observation,
to think of how,

4
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:17,560
what are you going to do with the data
you're going to be collecting, right?

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,932
And you're going to be producing.

6
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:24,773
And so, if this becomes part already
of your design and you have a,

7
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:30,740
you think of long-term accessibility of
that data, preservation of that data,

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,409
already you have that in mind as
you're building your study or,

9
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,080
again, your experiment.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,855
Then, there are more
chances that you make it,

11
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:45,330
that it will be easier for
you to make it accessible to others.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,720
>> So, students in my discipline at least,
I mean,

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,070
they need to be aware that data management
is a critical part of what they do,

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,590
and will do, as either practicing
engineers or scientists or

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,830
researchers
>> It's,

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,670
you need to be able to
keep track of your data.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,730
Keep track of the different
changes you've made to your data.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,550
Be able to, if you get sued for
example, as an engineer and

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,080
you need to show your calculations.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,850
You need to be able to manage all that
information, and be able to show it.

21
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,170
>> So, I see there being practical and
symbolic benefits.

22
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:27,685
>> The practical benefits I think are,
there's a plot.

23
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,430
There's a plan, from cradle to grave.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,540
What is the research question?

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,310
How are data being used
to address that question?

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,970
Are there other aspects of the research
project that are required, the required

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,660
data is there, and archiving requirement
for future use, and those sorts of things.

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,210
So that's the birth of the data,
the growth of it, and

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,690
the final archiving of it.

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,450
It's a practical way to begin what
is going to be a bunch of work.

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,975
They symbolic part, is it's a reason,
it's a focus for people to talk.

32
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:14,300
>> I think there's a sense, I certainly
get the sense in libraries that

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,830
people feel like we have a completely
known set of data management practices.

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't believe we do.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,950
I think for a lot of domains those
practices are still emerging.

36
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,200
So, I think that we should be really
open to identifying new kinds of

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,300
data management practices, and figuring
out what our role might be in them.

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,340
>> You need to have a digital librarian
to do organization of your data.

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,060
You need to have a social
scientist who can come and

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,870
help you how to arrange things,
how to share things.

41
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,220
And you need to have some sort of
a policy maven who can come and

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,090
say what type of policies you need for
these type of working together,

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,145
sharing, and collaboration and
things like that.

44
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:01,230
So, in a sense, you need multiple
communities together to form your,

45
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,900
what you call, a scientific fabric.

46
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,259
And you have multiple people to come and
read that.
