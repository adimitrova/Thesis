00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,180
Hello, my name is Helen Tibbo.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,580
Welcome to Research Data Management and
Sharing.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,890
Before I describe what we will
be exploring in this course,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,920
I would like to tell you a little
bit about the CRADLE project, and

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,680
my background.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,220
This MOOC was developed by
the CRADLE project at the University

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,730
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,650
was funded by the Institute of Museum and
Library Services, or IMLS.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,860
The CRADLE project stands for
Curating Research Assets and

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,180
Data using Lifecycle Education, and

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,340
is a collaboration between the School
of Information and Library Science,

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,210
the Odum Institute for Research and Social
Science, and the UNC University Libraries.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,310
EDINA and the Data Library at
the University of Edinburgh

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,350
also contributed content to this MOOC.

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,890
The folks at the University of Edinburgh
have created another great resource for

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,440
learning about research data
management called MANTRA.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,457
We strongly encourage students
to explore this rich resource.

18
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:12,929
Now, a bit about me and
why I am teaching this course.

19
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:18,100
I am an alumni distinguished professor
at the School of Information and

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,650
Library Science at UNC,
where I teach courses on data management,

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,680
digital preservation,
and records management.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,920
I was president of the Society of
American Archivists from 2010-2011,

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,801
and I have been the principal
investigator on a number

24
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:40,800
of IMLS funded projects
focused on digital curation.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,850
I am currently the head of the Standards
and Policies, Community Practice for

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,640
the National Science Foundation funded

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Datanet Federation Consortium Project
based at UNC.

28
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,400
So, why learn about
research data management?

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,500
Today funding agencies and journals
are increasingly requiring researchers

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,260
to share, archive, and plan for
the management of their data.

31
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:15,110
As research and information professionals
respond to these new requirements,

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,575
data curation knowledge is necessary for
the effective management,

33
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:22,980
long-term preservation, and reuse of data.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,380
This course will provide students
with knowledge of data management,

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,320
best practices throughout
the research life cycle

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,480
from the planning stage all the way to
when data will ideally be shared and

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,410
made available within
a trustworthy repository.

38
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:46,130
Besides responding to requirements,
effective data management

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,880
can also help researchers
optimize their research output,

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,690
increase the impact of their research and
support open scientific inquiry.

41
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,690
We will begin this course by
building a basic understanding of

42
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,690
research data and data management.

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,290
We will then cover data management
planning and funder requirements.

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,450
In module three, we will delve more
deeply into some best practices and

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,090
suggestions for working with data.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,800
And then in module four,
we will discuss the benefits and

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
challenges of data sharing, and

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,250
some techniques to enable researchers
to easily use each other's data.

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,630
We will end with a module
on how to preserve data and

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,360
the roles of trustworthy repositories.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,060
By the end of this course, you will have
a firm understanding of data management

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,130
best practices, as well as many data
management tools and resources to help

53
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,208
you foster data sharing and the conduct
of better science and scholarship.

54
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,756
Let's start.

55
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:01,579
