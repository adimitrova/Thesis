now, lets take a look array 
stakeholders involved in data management 
so, initially, you primary 
researchers, principal investigators, 
design study, 
specify data will collected, 
determine to analyze data 
draw conclusions analyses 
come to know data quite well, 
in a large research project complex 
data, difficult even 
primary researchers 
to know 
within a research project, 
you may also graduate students 
staff members tasked 
collecting data 
managing it, 
often analyzing well 
good data management 
facilitates clear communication 
between primary researchers 
graduate students 
also facilitates multiple 
students working together 
passing information to new students 
left project 
institutions universities 
research institutes, 
usually involved in setting 
internal data management policies 
institutions may also provide 
data management resources 
to researchers including 
data management training, 
support researchers writing 
data management plans 
services archiving data 
a data repository curates data, 
ensures longterm 
preservation data 
provides access to data 
data repositories work 
data creators 
to ensure data remain useful time 
data repositories also 
work data creators 
to place necessary access 
restrictions data, 
including determined 
institutional funder policies, 
embargoes, well security 
copyright concerns 
secondary user data is 
third party that comes 
picture later in research 
data lifecycle may use data 
to verify published results, 
secondary analyses teaching 
users come many backgrounds, 
including students, faculty, 
research project team members, 
private entities, businesses, 
government officials, journalists, 
citizen scientists 
funders agencies 
organizations that provide money 
to support a research project 
us federal funding agencies 
require researchers to actively 
properly manage data throughout 
research projects life cycle 
an end goal making data 
available accessible sharing, 
a data management plan is 
required project proposals 
plans clearly outline 
specifics data will 
effectively collected, managed, stored, 
preserved future access 
publishers journals disseminate 
scientific discovery 
maintain integrity 
scientific record 
publishers journals increasingly 
encouraging researchers to cite data, 
some, plos, 
public library science, issuing 
policies that require researchers 
to make data underlying published results 
available within a data repository 
you see there many different 
stakeholders involved in data management 
variety stakeholders 
suggests that proper management 
data throughout research 
lifecycle requires communication 
cooperation between various groups
