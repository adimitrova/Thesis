that we know data are, 
in this unit, 
we will familiarize 
meaning data management, 
importance, is involved, 
fits within research life cycle 
end this lesson, you will 
able to define data management 
term gets tossed around quite a bit in 
professional researcher circles 
a clear concept 
data management entails 
will especially important 
you move forward this mooc 
you will also understand 
importance managing data 
a part responsible research 
conduct roles 
responsibilities stakeholders 
in data management 
last, least, 
you will able to identify 
various data management tasks 
within research lifecycle 
so exactly is data management 
data management refers to activities 
practices that support long term 
preservation, access, use data 
activities surrounding data management 
include planning, documenting data, 
formatting data, storing data, 
anonymizing data, 
controlling access to data 
so is important to manage data 
data management helps 
researchers better research 
helps researchers optimize use data 
active phase 
research project 
helps collaborate 
researchers 
to use an analogy, 
lets think taxes 
if you manage receipts 
effectively year, 
taxes is easier in april, 
youre likely to 
maximize deductions 
get taxes in time without panic 
goes data management 
if you a plan follow it, 
is time well spent 
will simplify life later 
data management also ensures 
that data is preserved 
future researchers to discover, 
interpret, reuse 
further, sustains value data 
a research project 
completed, data could used to 
answer additional questions 
considered original project 
you, researcher, 
may also want to extend study 
time to longitudinal comparisons 
this is difficult, 
if impossible, if you 
effectively managed data 
last least, today 
a growing number funding agencies, 
journal publishers, research 
institutions require data management 
entities demanding 
transparency in research projects, 
data management is one way 
projects meet this requirement 
funders also often want to increase 
return investment 
ensuring data that is produced 
a project is available 
secondary analysis, replication, 
reuse future innovations
