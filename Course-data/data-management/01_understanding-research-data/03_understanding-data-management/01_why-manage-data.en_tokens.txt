now
that
we
know
what
data
are
,
in
this
unit
,
we
will
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
meaning
of
data
management
,
its
importance
,
who
is
involved
,
and
where
it
fits
within
the
research
life
cycle
.
by
the
end
of
this
lesson
,
you
will
be
able
to
define
data
management
.
the
term
gets
tossed
around
quite
a
bit
in
both
professional
and
researcher
circles
.
and
having
a
clear
concept
of
what
data
management
entails
will
be
especially
important
as
you
move
forward
with
this
mooc
.
you
will
also
understand
the
importance
of
managing
data
as
a
part
of
responsible
research
conduct
and
the
roles
and
responsibilities
of
stakeholders
in
data
management
.
and
last
,
but
not
least
,
you
will
be
able
to
identify
the
various
data
management
tasks
within
the
research
lifecycle
.
so
what
exactly
is
data
management
?
data
management
refers
to
activities
and
practices
that
support
long
term
preservation
,
access
,
and
use
of
data
.
the
activities
surrounding
data
management
can
include
planning
,
documenting
data
,
formatting
data
,
storing
data
,
anonymizing
data
,
and
controlling
access
to
data
.
so
why
is
it
important
to
manage
data
?
data
management
helps
researchers
do
better
research
.
it
helps
researchers
optimize
use
of
data
during
the
active
phase
of
the
research
project
.
and
helps
them
collaborate
with
other
researchers
.
to
use
an
analogy
,
let
's
think
of
doing
our
taxes
.
if
you
manage
your
receipts
effectively
during
the
year
,
doing
your
taxes
is
easier
in
april
,
and
you
're
more
likely
to
maximize
your
deductions
and
get
your
taxes
in
on
time
without
panic
.
the
same
goes
for
data
management
.
if
you
have
a
plan
and
follow
it
,
it
is
time
well
spent
and
it
will
simplify
your
life
later
on
.
data
management
also
ensures
that
data
is
preserved
for
future
researchers
to
discover
,
interpret
,
and
reuse
.
further
,
it
sustains
the
value
of
data
.
when
a
research
project
has
been
completed
,
the
data
could
be
used
to
answer
additional
questions
not
considered
during
the
original
project
.
you
,
the
researcher
,
may
also
want
to
extend
the
study
over
time
to
do
longitudinal
comparisons
.
this
is
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
if
you
have
not
effectively
managed
your
data
.
and
last
but
not
least
,
today
a
growing
number
of
funding
agencies
,
journal
publishers
,
and
research
institutions
require
data
management
.
these
entities
are
demanding
more
transparency
in
research
projects
,
and
data
management
is
one
way
projects
can
meet
this
requirement
.
funders
also
often
want
to
increase
their
return
on
investment
by
ensuring
the
data
that
is
produced
from
a
project
is
available
for
secondary
analysis
,
replication
,
or
reuse
for
future
innovations
.
