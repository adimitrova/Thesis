2
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:08,340
Now that we know what data are,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,970
in this unit,

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,130
we will familiarize ourselves with
the meaning of data management,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,580
its importance, who is involved, and where
it fits within the research life cycle.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,354
By the end of this lesson, you will
be able to define data management.

7
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:30,450
The term gets tossed around quite a bit in
both professional and researcher circles.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,890
And having a clear concept of
what data management entails

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,990
will be especially important as
you move forward with this MOOC.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,560
You will also understand
the importance of managing data

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,310
as a part of responsible research
conduct and the roles and

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,810
responsibilities of stakeholders
in data management.

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,620
And last, but not least,
you will be able to identify

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,060
the various data management tasks
within the research lifecycle.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,290
So what exactly is data management?

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,990
Data management refers to activities and

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,620
practices that support long term
preservation, access, and use of data.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,630
The activities surrounding data management
can include planning, documenting data,

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,910
formatting data, storing data,
anonymizing data, and

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,420
controlling access to data.

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,370
So why is it important to manage data?

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,018
Data management helps
researchers do better research.

23
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:37,120
It helps researchers optimize use of data

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,240
during the active phase
of the research project.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,429
And helps them collaborate
with other researchers.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,710
To use an analogy,
let's think of doing our taxes.

27
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,000
If you manage your receipts
effectively during the year,

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,470
doing your taxes is easier in April,

29
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,730
and you're more likely to
maximize your deductions and

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,680
get your taxes in on time without panic.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,950
The same goes for data management.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,040
If you have a plan and follow it,
it is time well spent and

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,930
it will simplify your life later on.

34
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,290
Data management also ensures
that data is preserved for

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,110
future researchers to discover,
interpret, and reuse.

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,910
Further, it sustains the value of data.

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,930
When a research project has been
completed, the data could be used to

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,020
answer additional questions not
considered during the original project.

39
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,920
You, the researcher,

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,069
may also want to extend the study over
time to do longitudinal comparisons.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,530
This is very difficult,

42
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,630
if not impossible, if you have not
effectively managed your data.

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,210
And last but not least, today
a growing number of funding agencies,

44
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,750
journal publishers, and research
institutions require data management.

45
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,340
These entities are demanding more
transparency in research projects,

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,323
and data management is one way
projects can meet this requirement.

47
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:13,500
Funders also often want to increase
their return on investment by

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,674
ensuring the data that is produced
from a project is available for

49
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:24,434
secondary analysis, replication,
or reuse for future innovations.
