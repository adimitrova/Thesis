2
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:11,110
Now, let's take a look at the array of
stakeholders involved in data management.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,120
So, initially, you have the primary
researchers, or principal investigators,

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,620
who design the study,
specify what data will be collected,

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,260
and determine how to analyze the data and
draw conclusions from these analyses.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,450
They come to know the data quite well, but

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,490
in a large research project with complex
data, it can be difficult even for

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,970
the primary researchers
to know what they have.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,250
Within a research project,
you may also have graduate students or

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,150
other staff members who are tasked
with collecting the data and

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,290
managing it, and
often analyzing it as well.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,100
Good data management
facilitates clear communication

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,450
between the primary researchers and
graduate students.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,850
It also facilitates multiple
students working together and

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,870
the passing of information to new students
from those who have left the project.

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,920
Institutions such as universities and
research institutes,

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,980
are usually involved in setting some of
the internal data management policies.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,550
Institutions may also provide
data management resources

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,450
to researchers including
data management training,

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,580
support for researchers writing
data management plans or

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,150
services for archiving data.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,578
A data repository curates data,

23
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:45,744
ensures the long-term
preservation of data and

24
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,520
provides access to data.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,770
Data repositories work
with the data creators

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,700
to ensure data remain useful over time.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,880
Data repositories also
work with data creators

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,300
to place any necessary access
restrictions on the data,

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,110
including those determined by
institutional or funder policies,

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,790
embargoes, as well as any security and
copyright concerns.

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,780
The secondary user of the data is
the third party that comes into

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,280
the picture later in the research
data life-cycle and may use the data

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,940
to verify published results, for
secondary analyses or for teaching.

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,360
Users can come from many backgrounds,
including students, faculty,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,610
research project team members,
private entities, businesses,

36
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,470
government officials, journalists,
or citizen scientists.

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,970
Funders are the agencies or

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,490
organizations that provide the money
to support a research project.

39
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,767
Most US Federal funding agencies
require researchers to actively and

40
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:02,820
properly manage their data throughout
the research projectâ€™s life cycle

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,740
with an end goal of making the data
available and accessible for sharing,

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,950
A data management plan is now
required of most project proposals.

43
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,360
These plans clearly outline
the specifics of how the data will be

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,340
effectively collected, managed, stored,
and preserved for future access.

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,020
Publishers and Journals disseminate
scientific discovery and

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,670
maintain the integrity of
the scientific record.

47
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,340
Publishers and Journals are increasingly
encouraging researchers to cite data,

48
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,840
and some, such as PLOS, or

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,210
the Public Library of Science, are issuing
policies that require researchers

50
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,780
to make data underlying published results
available within a data repository.

51
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,580
As you can see there are many different
stakeholders involved in data management.

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,728
The variety of stakeholders
suggests that proper management

53
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:06,866
of data throughout the research
lifecycle requires communication and

54
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:10,636
cooperation between these various groups.

55
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:20,199
