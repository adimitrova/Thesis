2
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:10,582
Now that we know what data management is,
and who the people involved are,

3
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:14,844
we will now show you where specific
data management practices fall within

4
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:16,410
the research lifecycle.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,480
To do this, we're going to use
the research lifecycle from

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,900
the Data Documentation Initiative, or DDI.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,300
During the initial phase of the research
lifecycle, that is the discovery and

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,920
planning phase, researchers will
need to determine what type and

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,310
format of data they are going to collect.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,470
This may involve collecting new data,

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,980
combining existing data sets or
analyzing existing data.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,670
If the project involves human subjects,
the researches will need to consider

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,910
privacy, confidentiality,
and other ethical issues.

14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,630
In addition, researchers should consider
what types of documentation they will

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,040
create and the metadata standards
they will use to describe their data.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,130
These are some of the details that should
be included in the data management plan.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:15,030
Further, researchers will need to identify
the potential reusers of the project data.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,750
Who will use this data?

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,480
What might they use it for?

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,310
Will the data, once stripped of any
potentially identifying information,

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,240
be useful for secondary reuse?

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,360
What access restrictions
will be placed on the data?

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,770
These are all questions that
the researchers need to answer

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,190
before the project even begins.

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,550
Contacting an information professional
early in the research life cycle can

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,850
assist researchers in
answering these questions.

27
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,900
As well as identifying appropriate data
repository, to archive their data.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,880
Finally, during this phase,
it is important for

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,700
researchers to determine the possible
costs surrounding data management.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,911
This will involve documenting the data,
formatting them,

31
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:07,290
storing them, cleaning and anonymizing
them, and finally archiving them.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,100
During the data collection phase,
primary researchers make certain that

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,220
the research team follows data
management best practices.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,540
At this point, this can include
file organization, backup and

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,060
storage strategies,
as well as quality assurance protocols.

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,190
Deciding on file organization schemes
including naming conventions and

37
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,340
file versioning policies
at the very beginning

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,910
will help make the data
collection process run smoothly.

39
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,785
This will decrease
the likelihood of duplicate or

40
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,770
out-of-sync versions of the data.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,020
You will also make locating
specific documents and files

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,910
at the end of the project much easier and
decrease the risk of losing content.

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,440
Backup and

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,440
storage strategies will be implemented
through the data collection process.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,010
As we know,
technology is not always a 100% reliable.

46
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,560
If a researcher has appropriate backup and
storage strategies in place,

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,160
this will help protect against data
loss from the beginning of the project.

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,520
It is best to discuss options for
secure backup and

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,190
storage with the institution's
IT department.

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,540
Quality assurance protocols outline and
document the steps and processes

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,410
necessary for checking and reviewing
the data during and after it is collected.

52
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,660
These protocols vary
across disciplines and

53
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,350
it is the responsibility of
the primary researcher and

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,050
the project team to implement these
protocols based on disciplinary standards.

55
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,240
It is also a good idea to
consider access controls and

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
data security during this
phase of the lifecycle.

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,670
While working with the IT department,

58
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,430
make sure to inform them of any
security concerns or needs.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,250
If the data is sensitive then the
appropriate steps will need to be taken to

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,800
ensure that they are safely stored and
only accessible to authorized individuals.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,570
Next is the preparation and
data analysis phase.

62
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,850
After collecting data, it may not be
in a form that can be readily analyzed.

63
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,020
Researchers may need to clean,
manipulate or process the raw data.

64
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,320
What is important at this point is
documenting the changes to the raw data

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,150
and creating a master version to be
analyzed and eventually archived.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,590
A common tip here is to make the final
version of the data read-only.

67
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,650
So it can't be inadvertently altered.

68
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,700
Once the master version of the data has
been prepared, data analysis can begin.

69
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,790
Data analysis can take many
forms across disciplines.

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,340
The most important thing to consider in
this phase is making sure to document

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,350
analysis procedures such as additional
modifications to the data, the model used,

72
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,000
the code used to run the analysis, and
hardware and software specifications.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,340
Having this detailed information will
help researchers write a better paper and

74
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,880
do better science.

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,580
During the publication and sharing phase,
a researcher will prepare their data

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,250
files and other research materials
necessary to interpret and

77
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,130
reuse the data in the future.

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,180
Data management best practices
dictate that data be stored and

79
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,250
made available to share in
a trustworthy data repository.

80
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,600
This phase is an opportunity to consult
with information professionals or

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,690
data repository staff.

82
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,440
Who can provide guidance as
you prepare data for sharing.

83
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,870
Researchers should make sure that their
data management meets all of the needs and

84
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,600
requirements of the repository.

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,910
This means that the data should be
in the appropriate file format,

86
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,830
should be cleaned to the specifications
of the repository, and

87
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,880
to comply with applicable privacy laws and
requirements.

88
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,620
Additionally, all documentation
should be reviewed

89
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,350
to ensure that the data can be reused and
standard metadata should be applied.

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,210
By working with a data repository,

91
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,440
researchers can ensure that data
will be properly preserved.

92
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,730
Discoverable, and usable in the future.

93
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,910
The end of the project can seem like
a bit of a blur and a time crunch.

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,960
But by following data management best
practices throughout the research life

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,590
cycle, you can rest assured that your
data will be available for the long term.

96
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,130
At this point your data are safely
stored in a data repository.

97
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,400
And you can begin planning for
your next project.

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,230
Some key repository functions got
ensure the long term management of data

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,200
include ensuring
the integrity of the data.

100
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,900
Protecting against data loss.

101
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,530
And providing access to data.

102
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,550
These and other functions
performed by trusted repositories

103
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,360
will be discussed in more
depth later in this course.

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,150
We covered a lot of data management
topics in this module, but

105
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,360
what is most important to take away
is that effective data management

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,400
takes places in all phases
of the research lifecycle.

107
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,808
From planning a project,
to collecting your data, to comparing and

108
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:37,596
analyzing your data, and then finally
publishing and sharing your data in

109
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:42,628
a repository that will see to their
long-term management and preservation.

110
