now
,
let
's
take
a
look
at
the
array
of
stakeholders
involved
in
data
management
.
so
,
initially
,
you
have
the
primary
researchers
,
or
principal
investigators
,
who
design
the
study
,
specify
what
data
will
be
collected
,
and
determine
how
to
analyze
the
data
and
draw
conclusions
from
these
analyses
.
they
come
to
know
the
data
quite
well
,
but
in
a
large
research
project
with
complex
data
,
it
can
be
difficult
even
for
the
primary
researchers
to
know
what
they
have
.
within
a
research
project
,
you
may
also
have
graduate
students
or
other
staff
members
who
are
tasked
with
collecting
the
data
and
managing
it
,
and
often
analyzing
it
as
well
.
good
data
management
facilitates
clear
communication
between
the
primary
researchers
and
graduate
students
.
it
also
facilitates
multiple
students
working
together
and
the
passing
of
information
to
new
students
from
those
who
have
left
the
project
.
institutions
such
as
universities
and
research
institutes
,
are
usually
involved
in
setting
some
of
the
internal
data
management
policies
.
institutions
may
also
provide
data
management
resources
to
researchers
including
data
management
training
,
support
for
researchers
writing
data
management
plans
or
services
for
archiving
data
.
a
data
repository
curates
data
,
ensures
the
long-term
preservation
of
data
and
provides
access
to
data
.
data
repositories
work
with
the
data
creators
to
ensure
data
remain
useful
over
time
.
data
repositories
also
work
with
data
creators
to
place
any
necessary
access
restrictions
on
the
data
,
including
those
determined
by
institutional
or
funder
policies
,
embargoes
,
as
well
as
any
security
and
copyright
concerns
.
the
secondary
user
of
the
data
is
the
third
party
that
comes
into
the
picture
later
in
the
research
data
life-cycle
and
may
use
the
data
to
verify
published
results
,
for
secondary
analyses
or
for
teaching
.
users
can
come
from
many
backgrounds
,
including
students
,
faculty
,
research
project
team
members
,
private
entities
,
businesses
,
government
officials
,
journalists
,
or
citizen
scientists
.
funders
are
the
agencies
or
organizations
that
provide
the
money
to
support
a
research
project
.
most
us
federal
funding
agencies
require
researchers
to
actively
and
properly
manage
their
data
throughout
the
research
projectÃ¢ÂÂs
life
cycle
with
an
end
goal
of
making
the
data
available
and
accessible
for
sharing
,
a
data
management
plan
is
now
required
of
most
project
proposals
.
these
plans
clearly
outline
the
specifics
of
how
the
data
will
be
effectively
collected
,
managed
,
stored
,
and
preserved
for
future
access
.
publishers
and
journals
disseminate
scientific
discovery
and
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
scientific
record
.
publishers
and
journals
are
increasingly
encouraging
researchers
to
cite
data
,
and
some
,
such
as
plos
,
or
the
public
library
of
science
,
are
issuing
policies
that
require
researchers
to
make
data
underlying
published
results
available
within
a
data
repository
.
as
you
can
see
there
are
many
different
stakeholders
involved
in
data
management
.
the
variety
of
stakeholders
suggests
that
proper
management
of
data
throughout
the
research
lifecycle
requires
communication
and
cooperation
between
these
various
groups
.
