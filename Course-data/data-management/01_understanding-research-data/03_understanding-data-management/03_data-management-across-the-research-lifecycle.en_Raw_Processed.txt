music 
that we know data management is, 
people involved are, 
we will show you specific 
data management practices fall within 
research lifecycle 
to this, going to use 
research lifecycle 
data documentation initiative, ddi 
initial phase research 
lifecycle, that is discovery 
planning phase, researchers will 
need to determine type 
format data going to collect 
this may involve collecting new data, 
combining existing data sets 
analyzing existing data 
if project involves human subjects, 
researches will need to consider 
privacy, confidentiality, 
ethical issues 
in addition, researchers consider 
types documentation will 
create metadata standards 
will use to describe data 
details that 
included in data management plan 
further, researchers will need to identify 
potential reusers project data 
will use this data 
might use 
will data, stripped 
potentially identifying information, 
useful secondary reuse 
access restrictions 
will placed data 
questions that 
researchers need to answer 
project even begins 
contacting an information professional 
early in research life cycle 
assist researchers in 
answering questions 
well identifying appropriate data 
repository, to archive data 
finally, this phase, 
is important 
researchers to determine possible 
costs surrounding data management 
this will involve documenting data, 
formatting them, 
storing them, cleaning anonymizing 
them, finally archiving 
data collection phase, 
primary researchers make certain that 
research team follows data 
management best practices 
this point, this include 
file organization, backup 
storage strategies, 
well quality assurance protocols 
deciding file organization schemes 
including naming conventions 
file versioning policies 
beginning 
will help make data 
collection process run smoothly 
this will decrease 
likelihood duplicate 
outofsync versions data 
you will also make locating 
specific documents files 
end project much easier 
decrease risk losing content 
backup 
storage strategies will implemented 
data collection process 
we know, 
technology is always a reliable 
if a researcher appropriate backup 
storage strategies in place, 
this will help protect data 
loss beginning project 
is best to discuss options 
secure backup 
storage institutions 
department 
quality assurance protocols outline 
document steps processes 
necessary checking reviewing 
data is collected 
protocols vary 
across disciplines 
is responsibility 
primary researcher 
project team to implement 
protocols based disciplinary standards 
is also a good idea to 
consider access controls 
data security this 
phase lifecycle 
while working department, 
make sure to inform 
security concerns needs 
if data is sensitive 
appropriate steps will need to taken to 
ensure that safely stored 
accessible to authorized individuals 
next is preparation 
data analysis phase 
collecting data, may 
in a form that readily analyzed 
researchers may need to clean, 
manipulate process raw data 
is important this point is 
documenting changes to raw data 
creating a master version to 
analyzed eventually archived 
a common tip here is to make final 
version data readonly 
so cant inadvertently altered 
master version data 
prepared, data analysis begin 
data analysis take many 
forms across disciplines 
important thing to consider in 
this phase is making sure to document 
analysis procedures additional 
modifications to data, model used, 
code used to run analysis, 
hardware software specifications 
this detailed information will 
help researchers write a better paper 
better science 
publication sharing phase, 
a researcher will prepare data 
files research materials 
necessary to interpret 
reuse data in future 
data management best practices 
dictate that data stored 
made available to share in 
a trustworthy data repository 
this phase is an opportunity to consult 
information professionals 
data repository staff 
provide guidance 
you prepare data sharing 
researchers make sure that 
data management meets needs 
requirements repository 
this means that data 
in appropriate file format, 
cleaned to specifications 
repository, 
to comply applicable privacy laws 
requirements 
additionally, documentation 
reviewed 
to ensure that data reused 
standard metadata applied 
working a data repository, 
researchers ensure that data 
will properly preserved 
discoverable, usable in future 
end project seem like 
a bit a blur a time crunch 
following data management best 
practices throughout research life 
cycle, you rest assured that 
data will available long term 
this point data safely 
stored in a data repository 
you begin planning 
next project 
key repository functions got 
ensure long term management data 
include ensuring 
integrity data 
protecting data loss 
providing access to data 
functions 
performed trusted repositories 
will discussed in 
depth later in this course 
we covered a lot data management 
topics in this module, 
is important to take away 
is that effective data management 
takes places in phases 
research lifecycle 
planning a project, 
to collecting data, to comparing 
analyzing data, finally 
publishing sharing data in 
a repository that will see to 
longterm management preservation
