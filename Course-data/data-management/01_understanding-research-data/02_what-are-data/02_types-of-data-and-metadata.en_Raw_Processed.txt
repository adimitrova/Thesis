lets look different types data 
probably us think 
we use term data is numeric 
tabular data, researchers might 
refer to quantitative data 
there types 
samples dna 
blood samples, physical collections, 
including plant specimens, 
software programs code, databases, 
algorithms, model, geodatabases 
obviously, 
types data there 
you think examples 
types you encountered 
please share in forum 
there research products that 
need to considered alongside data 
in order data to meaningful 
include questionnaires, code books, 
descriptions methodologies 
jillian wallis, elizabeth rolando, 
christine borgman describe 
this background data 
background data provides contextual 
information important in analysis 
primary foreground 
data collected analysis 
example, temperature 
time a sensor reading is taken 
may critical to understanding 
variances in data a sensor collected 
there research products 
built data that essential 
secondary analysis metaanalysis 
content dissemination 
include reports, conference posters, 
articles, white papers, books 
we include websites blogs 
another essential concept in 
data management is metadata 
this is a term that you will hear 
refer to throughout this course 
metadata is often defined 
data data 
this, course, is a basic circular 
definition that may help us much 
specifically, metadata is 
structured information that describes, 
explains, locates, 
otherwise represents something else 
interest in this course, 
that something else is, 
course, target research data 
metadata makes easier to retrieve, 
use manage an information source 
data nothing without metadata, 
especially digital data 
one cannot search for, identify, 
interpret data without robust metadata 
dataset, we need to know 
minimum, created data, 
data created 
published, 
a title descriptive name 
used to refer to dataset 
in this digital landscape, 
we also need a unique 
persistent identifier 
data so that we locate it, 
even if data moved to 
a different location web 
beyond metadata elements, 
we increase ability to find 
identify data if we 
information these, along 
metadata elements that make 
dublin core metadata element set 
dublin core allows us to find 
identify data 
to able to interpret 
use data intended, 
we also need to know quite a bit 
information data 
data documentation initiative, ddi, 
developed a metadata scheme 
specifically this purpose 
along basic dublin core elements, 
ddi prescribes additional 
metadata elements that 
provide specific information 
data collection processes, 
variablelevel descriptions,
