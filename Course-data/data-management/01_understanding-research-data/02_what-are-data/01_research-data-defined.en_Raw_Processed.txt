to begin this course, 
we need to first discuss basics 
fundamental question 
us is data 
while this may seem like 
a straightforward question, 
numerous organizations tackled 
resulting in a range definitions 
important to note that data 
different various disciplines 
different context 
end this lesson, 
you will introduced to multiple 
types data in an array contexts 
data come in many forms numeric 
textual data to biological samples 
physical collections 
you will also able to make 
distinction between research data 
associated researcher materials 
may 
required alongside data 
to understand data 
finally, 
this is probably one 
important concepts in entire course 
you will understand data in context 
research data life cycle 
to understand data management, is to 
understand data in constructs 
project planning, 
collection data to archiving that data 
a research output 
project period ended 
first, lets take a look 
others defined data 
national institutes health, nih, 
define data recorded factual material 
commonly accepted in 
scientific community 
necessary to validate 
research findings 
key concepts here include recorded 
accessible data that others may look 
to validate a studies findings 
national science foundation 
nsf considers data to something, 
determined community interest 
process peer review 
project management 
nsfs definition points data 
essential to research community 
to individual researchers 
research teams 
nsf also offers examples data 
that make rather abstract 
definition easier to understand 
we know, examples always useful 
nsf list includes data, publications, 
samples, physical collections, 
software, models 
interesting that nsf includes 
data an example data, 
point here is there many types 
data beyond quantitative datasets 
national endowment 
humanities, neh, 
also offers examples data that 
includes citations, software code, 
algorithms, digital tools, 
documentation, databases, 
geospatial coordinates, 
reports articles 
is interesting to note that neh 
includes a wider array data types 
we see nsf nih 
data types neh 
defines humanities data, 
materials generated collected 
course conducting research 
so key concepts 
in definitions 
nih nsf, research 
community establishes definitions 
data that involve validity 
presume data sharing among community 
you look examples provided 
organizations, 
you see that data come in 
quite a significant variety forms, 
almost to point nebulous 
is important to understand here 
is that data products research 
that heterogeneous across 
contextualized within 
academic disciplines 
so to reiterate, 
data valid, shared, 
heterogeneous, contextualized 
within research communities
