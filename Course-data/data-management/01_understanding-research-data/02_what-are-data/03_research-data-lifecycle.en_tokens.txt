when
thinking
about
and
doing
data
management
,
it
is
critical
to
understand
data
in
terms
of
their
lifecycle
and
the
research
projectÃ¢ÂÂs
lifecycle
.
for
project
planning
to
archiving
,
proper
data
management
happens
throughout
the
research
lifecycle
.
each
stage
of
the
lifecycle
produces
specific
data
products
and
requires
a
variety
of
considerations
,
responsibilities
,
and
activities
.
there
are
numerous
lifecycle
models
from
simple
to
complex
.
let
's
look
at
a
few
.
here
is
the
research
lifecycle
model
from
the
uk
data
archive
.
once
data
are
created
,
which
is
represented
in
the
circle
at
12
o'clock
,
the
data
undergo
subsequent
stages
,
processing
,
analyzing
,
preserving
,
providing
access
to
,
and
re-using
the
data
.
the
university
of
virginia
library
created
this
research
data
life
cycle
model
,
which
i
think
directly
aligns
to
common
research
practice
.
here
is
the
more
complex
and
comprehensive
data
lifecycle
model
developed
by
the
digital
curation
center
.
with
data
at
the
center
of
the
graphic
,
you
can
see
the
various
data
curation
activities
as
you
move
to
the
outer
rings
.
this
model
brings
together
data
,
researchers
and
curators
.
now
that
you
have
been
introduced
to
data
and
understand
that
data
management
refers
to
activities
throughout
the
data
lifecycle
,
please
take
a
moment
to
introduce
yourself
on
the
forums
and
tell
us
about
your
data
experiences
,
or
maybe
even
questions
you
have
about
data
or
the
course
.
we
have
also
provided
some
additional
readings
for
you
to
explore
if
you
're
interested
in
learning
more
.
and
make
sure
you

module
