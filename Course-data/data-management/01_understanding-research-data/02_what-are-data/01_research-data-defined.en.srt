2
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:10,100
To begin this course,
we need to first discuss some basics.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,350
The most fundamental question for
us is what are data?

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
While this may seem like
a straightforward question,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,660
numerous organizations have tackled it
resulting in a range of definitions.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,380
It's important to note that data
are different for various disciplines and

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,380
different context.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,040
By the end of this lesson,

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,780
you will be introduced to multiple
types of data in an array of contexts.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,850
Data come in many forms from numeric and

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,887
textual data to biological samples and
physical collections.

12
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:49,826
You will also be able to make
the distinction between research data and

13
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,250
other associated researcher materials.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,900
Some of which may be
required alongside the data

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,610
to understand the data themselves.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,550
And finally, and

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,020
this is probably one of the most
important concepts in the entire course.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,360
You will understand data in the context
of the research data life cycle.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,330
To understand data management, is to
understand data in all of its constructs.

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,830
From project planning, through the
collection of data to archiving that data

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,150
as a research output after
the project period has ended.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,310
First, let's take a look at
how others have defined data.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:39,430
The National Institutes of Health, or NIH,
define data as “recorded factual material

24
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,560
commonly accepted in
the scientific community

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,060
as necessary to validate
research findings.”

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,760
Key concepts here include recorded and

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,880
accessible data that others may look
at to validate a studies findings.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,075
The National Science Foundation or
NSF considers data to be something,

29
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:05,695
determined by the community of interest
through the process of peer review and

30
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:07,330
project management.

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,025
NSF’s definition points out the data are
essential to the research community and

32
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:17,026
not just to individual researchers or
research teams.

33
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:20,560
NSF also offers some examples of data

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,730
that make the rather abstract
definition easier to understand.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,750
As we know, examples are always useful.

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,560
The NSF list includes data, publications,

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,370
samples, physical collections,
software, and models.

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,940
It's interesting that NSF includes
data as an example of data,

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,250
but the point here is there are many types
of data beyond quantitative datasets.

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,100
The National Endowment for
the Humanities, or NEH,

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,570
also offers examples of data that
includes citations, software code,

42
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,870
algorithms, digital tools,
documentation, databases,

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,660
geospatial coordinates,
reports and articles.

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,540
It is interesting to note that NEH
includes a wider array of data types

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,590
than we see from NSF or NIH.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Any of these data types NEH
defines as humanities data, or

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,140
“materials generated or collected during
the course of conducting research.”

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,670
So what are some key concepts
in these definitions?

49
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,810
For NIH and NSF, the research
community establishes definitions

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,370
of data that involve validity and
presume data sharing among the community.

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,900
When you look at the examples provided
by any of these organizations,

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,070
you can see that data come in
quite a significant variety of forms,

53
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,860
almost to the point of being nebulous.

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,320
What is important to understand here

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,560
is that data are products of research
that are heterogeneous across and

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,780
contextualized within
the academic disciplines.

57
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,828
So to reiterate,
data should be valid, shared, and

58
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:20,163
are heterogeneous, and contextualized
within research communities.

59
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:28,169
