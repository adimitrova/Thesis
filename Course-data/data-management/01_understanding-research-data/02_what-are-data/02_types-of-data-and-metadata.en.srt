2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,570
Let's look at different types of data.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,530
Probably what most of us think about
when we use the term data is numeric or

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,439
tabular data, what researchers might
refer to as quantitative data.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,290
And then there are other types.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,210
Samples such as DNA or
blood samples, physical collections,

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,827
including plant specimens,
software programs and code, databases,

8
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,632
algorithms, model, and geodatabases.

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,850
Obviously, these are not all
the types of data out there.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,690
Can you think of other examples?

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,190
What types have you encountered?

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,070
Please share them in the forum.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,290
There are other research products that
need to be considered alongside data

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,110
in order for the data to be meaningful.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,930
These include questionnaires, code books,
and descriptions of methodologies.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,176
Jillian Wallis, Elizabeth Rolando,

17
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:20,060
and Christine Borgman describe
this as background data.

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,220
Background data provides contextual
information important in the analysis

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,220
of the primary foreground
data collected for analysis.

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,550
For example, what the temperature was
at the time a sensor reading is taken

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,070
may be critical to understanding
variances in data a sensor collected.

22
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,400
And then there are research products
built on the data that are essential for

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,330
secondary analysis or meta-analysis and
for content dissemination.

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,869
These include reports, conference posters,
articles, white papers, and books.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,100
And we should include websites and blogs.

26
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,060
Another essential concept in
data management is metadata.

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,490
This is a term that you will hear
me refer to throughout this course.

28
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,190
Metadata is often defined
as data about data.

29
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,560
This, of course, is a basic and circular
definition that may not help us too much.

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,060
More specifically, metadata is
structured information that describes,

31
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,130
explains, locates, or
otherwise represents something else.

32
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,590
For our interest in this course,
that something else is,

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,580
of course, our target research data.

34
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,850
Metadata makes it easier to retrieve,
use or manage an information source.

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,960
Data are nothing without metadata,
especially digital data.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,198
One cannot search for, identify, or
interpret data without robust metadata.

37
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:08,110
For each dataset, we need to know
at minimum, who created the data,

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,350
when the data were created or
published, and

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,565
a title or descriptive name
used to refer to the dataset.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,990
In this digital landscape,
we also need a unique and

41
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,070
persistent identifier for
the data so that we can locate it,

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,198
even if the data are moved to
a different location on the web.

43
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:31,670
Beyond these metadata elements,
we can increase our ability to find and

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,460
identify data if we have
information about these, along with

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,970
the other 11 metadata elements that make
up the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.

46
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,850
Dublin Core allows us to find and
identify data.

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,490
But to be able to interpret and
use data as they were intended,

48
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,360
we also need to know quite a bit of
other information about the data.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,667
The Data Documentation Initiative, or DDI,

50
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,834
developed a metadata scheme
specifically for this purpose.

51
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:08,884
Along with basic Dublin Core Elements,

52
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:14,007
DDI prescribes additional
metadata elements that

53
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:20,680
provide specific information
about data collection processes,

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,295
variable-level descriptions,
and methodologies.
