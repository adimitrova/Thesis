When thinking about and doing data
management, it is critical to understand

3
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:17,700
data in terms of their lifecycle and
the research projectâ€™s lifecycle.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,180
For project planning to archiving,

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,430
proper data management happens
throughout the research lifecycle.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,050
Each stage of the lifecycle
produces specific data products and

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,780
requires a variety of considerations,
responsibilities, and activities.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,260
There are numerous lifecycle
models from simple to complex.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,100
Let's look at a few.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,160
Here is the research lifecycle
model from the UK Data Archive.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,540
Once data are created, which is
represented in the circle at 12 o'clock,

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,400
the data undergo subsequent stages,
processing, analyzing,

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,850
preserving, providing access to,
and re-using the data.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,330
The University of Virginia library created
this research data life cycle model,

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,540
which I think directly aligns
to common research practice.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,150
Here is the more complex and

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,060
comprehensive data lifecycle model
developed by the Digital Curation Center.

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,710
With data at the center of the graphic,
you can see the various data

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,890
curation activities as you
move to the outer rings.

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,210
This model brings together data,
researchers and curators.

21
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,240
Now that you have been
introduced to data and

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,610
understand that data management refers to
activities throughout the data lifecycle,

23
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,350
please take a moment to introduce yourself
on the forums and tell us about your

24
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,250
data experiences, or maybe even questions
you have about data or the course.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,908
We have also provided some
additional readings for

26
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,829
you to explore if you're
interested in learning more.

27
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,994
And make sure you check out
the resources for this module.
