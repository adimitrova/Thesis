2
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:11,490
Let's take a look at the data
management policies from a few of

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,089
the major US funding agencies.

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,189
The National Science Foundation
data management plan

5
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,467
policy requires that proposals
include a supplementary

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:26,756
Data Management Plan document
of no more than two pages.

7
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,900
That includes information on five
key aspects of data management.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,490
The types of data to be produced for
the project, data and metadata format and

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,470
content, policies for access and
sharing, including security provisions,

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,440
policies and provisions for
dissemination and reuse.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,990
And plans for archiving, preserving,
and providing access to the data.

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,990
The National Institutes of Health
requires applicants seeking $500,000 or

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,820
more in direct costs to
provide a description of

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,660
how project data will be made
available in a data sharing plan.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,158
This document should describe final
dataset formats, documentation,

16
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:19,987
analytic tools necessary to use the data,
data sharing agreements,

17
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:24,951
and how and when the data will
be made accessible to others.

18
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:29,314
The National Endowment for the Humanities
summarizes the content of data

19
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:34,830
management plans they require with two
questions that should be addressed.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,160
What data are generated by your research?

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,836
And what is your plan for
managing these data?

22
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:47,055
To answer these questions,
NEH requires that the DMP describe

23
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:51,682
the data to be produced,
how the data will be managed and

24
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:56,014
maintained during the active
phase of the project,

25
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:02,414
any factors that might impact the
researcher's ability to manage the data,

26
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,353
types of information that
need to be managed and

27
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:12,656
maintained alongside the data, how data
will be shared in a timely manner,

28
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:16,530
and the facilities used
to preserve the data.

29
