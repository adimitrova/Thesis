2
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:10,596
At this point, you have a good
understanding of what is required to

3
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:15,220
effectively manage data as you move
through the research life cycle.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,830
As you know, data management
can seem quite the undertaking,

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,000
when you consider all the aspects
of data management best practice.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,570
But data management does not
have to be overwhelming,

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,240
if you have a data management plan.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,660
A data management plan or a DMP for
short is a formal document

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,820
that describes the data produced in
the course of a research project.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,680
And outlines the data management
strategies that will be implemented both

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,950
during the active phase of the research
project and after the project ends.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,350
If you have been involved in a research
project supported by a major funding

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,840
agency, you probably have a good idea
of what should be included in a DMP.

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,480
Many funding agencies,
particularly federal agencies, now require

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,965
grantees to submit a data management
plan as part of the proposal package.

16
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:21,303
If you think you or your clients
may be applying for a grant from

17
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:26,395
the National Science Foundation,
the National Institutes of Health,

18
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:32,496
the Alfred P Sloan Foundation, NASA, the
Institute of Museum and Library Services.

19
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:37,502
The National Endowment for
the Humanities, the Gordon and

20
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:43,111
Betty Moore Foundation,
the Institute of Education Sciences and

21
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:48,116
the Economic and
Social Research Council, the Science and

22
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:53,123
Technology Facilities Council,
the Wellcome Trust, and

23
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:59,940
while the list goes on you will need to
know how to write a comprehensive DMP.

24
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,570
Even if you won't be
participating in funded research,

25
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,060
writing a DMP will encourage you
to think carefully about the data

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,740
management needs of your research data and
plan accordingly.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,550
Remember, like planning for
your taxes, planning for

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,020
data management will save you time and
headaches in the long run.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,008
By the end of this lesson, you will
be able to identify the components

30
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:30,824
of a good DMP, understand
the importance and purpose of DMPs, and

31
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:35,940
be familiar with the DMP policies
of several funding agencies.

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,800
Also, you will add to tour toolkit
some great resources and tools for

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,580
data management planning.

34
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,790
Let's go ahead and get started.

35
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,996
Just as I mentioned, many funding
agencies now require grantees to submit

36
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:56,622
a data management plan as part of
the proposal package submission.

37
00:02:56,622 --> 00:03:01,406
This gives assurances to
the funding agency the project data

38
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:06,250
will be accessible and
usable over the long term.

39
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,960
They want to see that you have
established a strategy for

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,050
managing your data throughout
the research lifecycle.

41
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,840
Making plans for how you will collect,
document, organize,

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,220
and preserve your data are all part
of the data management strategy.

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,210
This is important for funding agencies,
for two primary reasons.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,600
The first reason is transparency and
openness.

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,963
It is an expectation that publicly
funded research data will

46
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:45,175
be discoverable, accessible,
and reusable to the public.

47
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:49,522
Since they underwrite federally
funded grants, it is a government

48
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:54,634
responsibility to ensure citizens can see
where their tax dollars are spent and

49
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,390
allow them to capitalize on
the products of these grants.

50
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,060
A data management plan that illustrates
how data will be made discoverable,

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,190
accessible and
reusable supports this responsibility.

52
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,310
The second reason is return on investment.

53
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,328
Making data discoverable,
accessible and reusable,

54
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:21,831
maximizes the research
potential of the data and

55
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:26,458
provides greater returns on
public investments and research.

56
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,363
Well-managed data allows for
verification or

57
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:36,220
refinement of published research results,
reduces the potential for

58
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,564
scientific fraud, promotes new research
through the use of existing data,

59
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:46,958
provides resources for
training new researchers and

60
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,464
discourages unintentional
redundancy in research.

61
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:57,414
By planning for data management, these
benefits are more likely to be realized.

62
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:03,439
