this point, you a good 
understanding is required to 
effectively manage data you move 
research life cycle 
you know, data management 
seem quite undertaking, 
you consider aspects 
data management best practice 
data management 
to overwhelming, 
if you a data management plan 
a data management plan a dmp 
short is a formal document 
that describes data produced in 
course a research project 
outlines data management 
strategies that will implemented 
active phase research 
project project ends 
if you involved in a research 
project supported a major funding 
agency, you probably a good idea 
included in a dmp 
many funding agencies, 
particularly federal agencies, require 
grantees to submit a data management 
plan part proposal package 
if you think you clients 
may applying a grant 
national science foundation, 
national institutes health, 
alfred p sloan foundation, nasa, 
institute museum library services 
national endowment 
humanities, gordon 
betty moore foundation, 
institute education sciences 
economic 
social research council, science 
technology facilities council, 
wellcome trust, 
while list goes you will need to 
know to write a comprehensive dmp 
even if you wont 
participating in funded research, 
writing a dmp will encourage you 
to think carefully data 
management needs research data 
plan accordingly 
remember, like planning 
taxes, planning 
data management will save you time 
headaches in long run 
end this lesson, you will 
able to identify components 
a good dmp, understand 
importance purpose dmps, 
familiar dmp policies 
several funding agencies 
also, you will add to tour toolkit 
great resources tools 
data management planning 
lets go ahead get started 
i mentioned, many funding 
agencies require grantees to submit 
a data management plan part 
proposal package submission 
this gives assurances to 
funding agency project data 
will accessible 
usable long term 
want to see that you 
established a strategy 
managing data throughout 
research lifecycle 
making plans you will collect, 
document, organize, 
preserve data part 
data management strategy 
this is important funding agencies, 
two primary reasons 
first reason is transparency 
openness 
is an expectation that publicly 
funded research data will 
discoverable, accessible, 
reusable to public 
since underwrite federally 
funded grants, is a government 
responsibility to ensure citizens see 
tax dollars spent 
allow to capitalize 
products grants 
a data management plan that illustrates 
data will made discoverable, 
accessible 
reusable supports this responsibility 
second reason is return investment 
making data discoverable, 
accessible reusable, 
maximizes research 
potential data 
provides greater returns 
public investments research 
wellmanaged data allows 
verification 
refinement published research results, 
reduces potential 
scientific fraud, promotes new research 
use existing data, 
provides resources 
training new researchers 
discourages unintentional 
redundancy in research 
planning data management, 
benefits likely to realized
