in
all
of
these
three
data
management
policies
,
dmp
should
describe
in
detail
all
major
aspects
of
data
management
throughout
the
research
life
cycle
.
here
is
a
checklist
for
a
data
management
plan
from
the
digital
curation
center
that
list
questions
that
should
be
addressed
in
the
dmp
.
what
data
will
you
collect
or
create
?
to
answer
this
question
,
you
should
provide
a
description
of
the
data
,
including
the
type
,
format
,
and
volume
,
with
a
justification
of
the
format
choice
.
if
there
are
any
storage
implications
due
to
the
format
or
volume
of
the
data
.
you
should
include
these
as
well
.
how
will
the
data
be
collected
or
created
?
describe
the
data
collection
methods
to
be
used
,
including
the
standards
that
dictate
these
methods
.
you
should
also
discuss
your
plans
for
organizing
data
files
and
applying
version
control
,
as
well
as
how
quality
assurance
protocols
will
be
implemented
during
and
after
data
collection
.
what
documentation
of
metadata
will
accompany
the
data
?
it
is
important
to
determine
what
information
will
be
required
to
ensure
that
the
data
be
understandable
to
secondary
users
of
the
data
,
or
for
you
and
your
team
in
the
future
.
in
other
words
,
you
should
describe
the
type
of
documentation
that
will
be
needed
to
accompany
the
data
in
order
to
interpret
and
use
them
.
these
documents
might
include
a
description
of
the
methodologies
,
a
codebook
that
provides
variable
and
value
definitions
,
questionnaires
or
instruments
,
or
analysis
procedures
.
how
will
you
manage
any
ethical
issues
?
the
dmp
should
demonstrate
that
you
have
considered
critical
issues
related
to
laws
and
guidelines
.
regarding
the
protection
of
human
subjects
.
if
your
project
will
conduct
research
involving
human
participants
,
you
need
to
describe
provisions
for
protecting
their
confidentiality
.
this
should
include
strategies
for
handling
and
storing
sensitive
data
,
restricting
access
to
sensitive
data
,
and
preparing
de-indentified
datasets
for
sharing
.
how
will
you
manage
copyright
and
intellectual
property
rights
issues
?
this
is
where
legal
issues
of
data
ownership
need
to
be
addressed
.
you
need
to
identify
the
owner
of
the
data
and
their
conditions
for
using
the
data
.
if
you
are
reusing
third-party
data
particularly
property
data
.
you
should
discuss
permissions
with
the
data
producer
.
how
will
the
data
be
stored
and
backed
up
during
research
?
to
answer
this
question
,
you
should
describe
provisions
for
storage
.
and
the
degree
to
which
they
are
adequate
for
the
type
and
size
of
your
data
.
provisions
for
storage
should
include
plans
for
systematic
back
ups
of
the
data
files
.
how
will
you
manage
access
and
security
.
if
the
data
are
sensitive
or
should
otherwise
be
restricted
.
to
authorize
project
personnel
.
you
should
describe
in
detail
security
measures
that
will
be
in
place
to
protect
the
data
.
you
also
need
to
describe
the
standards
with
which
those
security
measures
comply
.
which
data
should
be
retained
,
shared
,
and/or
preserved
?
in
thinking
about
how
the
data
will
be
used
by
others
or
by
your
team
in
the
future
,
you
should
make
note
of
the
potential
value
of
the
data
and
the
effort
that
will
be
required
to
prepare
the
datasets
for
preservation
and
access
.
what
is
the
long-term
preservation
plan
for
the
dataset
?
answering
this
question
requires
you
to
identify
the
repository
you
will
use
to
archive
the
data
and
your
plans
to
prepare
and
document
the
data
to
ensure
that
they
will
be
preserved
and
usable
into
the
foreseeable
future
.
how
will
you
share
the
data
?
here
you
should
identify
the
mechanism
you
will
use
to
share
your
data
.
describe
how
others
might
find
your
data
and
how
data
files
will
be
delivered
.
you
should
also
specify
how
you
would
like
others
to
acknowledge
or
sight
your
data
.
are
any
restrictions
on
data
sharing
required
?
again
,
if
privacy
concerns
affect
your
ability
to
share
project
data
,
you
will
need
to
discuss
them
and
how
you
will
overcome
these
concerns
to
enable
data
sharing
whether
by
providing
anonymized
versions
of
the
data
.
requiring
a
data
use
agreement
or
other
mechanisms
.
you
may
also
choose
to
place
an
embargo
on
the
data
,
to
ensure
you
have
exclusive
use
of
the
data
for
a
period
of
time
.
if
this
is
the
case
,
you
should
explain
why
this
is
necessary
.
who
will
be
responsible
for
data
management
?
quite
simply
,
you
need
to
identify
,
by
name
if
possible
,
who
will
oversee
the
implementation
of
the
data
management
plan
.
what
resources
will
you
require
to
implement
your
plan
?
for
some
projects
with
complex
data
,
whether
due
to
type
,
size
,
or
the
fact
that
project
activities
are
geographically
distributed
among
different
institutions
,
data
management
might
require
specialized
expertise
or
special
equipment
.
you
may
also
consider
costs
associated
with
performing
ongoing
data
management
tasks
,
as
well
as
the
resources
required
for
long-term
preservation
of
the
data
in
a
repository
.
