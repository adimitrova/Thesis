writing a data management plan gets you
to think through data management issues
early on in the research life cycle.
by considering all of these issues,
you will not only be in compliance
with data management requirements,
you will also be better prepared to
implement data management strategies.
even if you aren't required to
write a data management plan,
this is a helpful process
