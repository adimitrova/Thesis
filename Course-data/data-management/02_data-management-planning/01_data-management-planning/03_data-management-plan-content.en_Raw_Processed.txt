in three data management 
policies, dmp describe in detail 
major aspects data management 
throughout research life cycle 
here is a checklist a data management 
plan digital curation center 
that list questions that 
addressed in dmp 
data will you collect create 
to answer this question, you 
provide a description data, 
including type, format, volume, 
a justification format choice 
if there storage implications 
due to format volume data 
you include well 
will data collected created 
describe data collection 
methods to used, 
including standards 
that dictate methods 
you also discuss plans 
organizing data files 
applying version control, 
well quality assurance 
protocols will implemented 
data collection 
documentation metadata 
will accompany data 
is important to determine 
information will required to ensure 
that data understandable to 
secondary users data, 
you team in future 
in words, you 
describe type documentation 
that will needed to accompany data 
in order to interpret use 
documents might include 
a description methodologies, 
a codebook that provides variable 
value definitions, questionnaires 
instruments, analysis procedures 
will you manage ethical issues 
dmp demonstrate 
that you considered critical 
issues related to laws guidelines 
regarding protection 
human subjects 
if project will conduct research 
involving human participants, 
you need to describe provisions 
protecting confidentiality 
this include strategies 
handling 
storing sensitive data, 
restricting access to sensitive data, 
preparing deindentified datasets 
sharing 
will you manage copyright 
intellectual property rights issues 
this is legal issues data 
ownership need to addressed 
you need to identify owner data 
conditions using data 
if you reusing thirdparty 
data particularly property data 
you discuss permissions 
data producer 
will data stored 
backed research 
to answer this question, you 
describe provisions storage 
degree to adequate 
type size data 
provisions 
storage include plans 
systematic back ups data files 
will you manage access security 
if data sensitive 
otherwise restricted 
to authorize project personnel 
you describe in 
detail security measures 
that will in place to protect data 
you also need to describe standards 
security measures comply 
data retained, 
shared, andor preserved 
in thinking data will 
used others team in 
future, you make note 
potential value data effort 
that will required to prepare 
datasets preservation access 
is longterm preservation 
plan dataset 
answering this question requires you 
to identify repository you will 
use to archive data plans 
to prepare document data 
to ensure that will preserved 
usable foreseeable future 
will you share data 
here you identify mechanism 
you will use to share data 
describe others might find data 
data files will delivered 
you also specify you would like 
others to acknowledge sight data 
restrictions 
data sharing required 
again, if privacy concerns affect 
ability to share project data, 
you will need to discuss 
you will overcome concerns 
to enable data sharing whether 
providing anonymized versions data 
requiring a data use agreement 
mechanisms 
you may also choose to place 
an embargo data, 
to ensure you exclusive use 
data a period time 
if this is case, 
you explain this is necessary 
will responsible 
data management 
quite simply, you need to identify, 
name if possible, 
will oversee implementation 
data management plan 
resources will you require 
to implement plan 
projects complex data, 
whether due to type, size, fact 
that project activities geographically 
distributed among different institutions, 
data management might require specialized 
expertise special equipment 
you may also consider costs 
associated performing ongoing 
data management tasks, 
well resources required 
longterm preservation
