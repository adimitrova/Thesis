2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:11,354
In all of these three data management
policies, DMP should describe in detail

3
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:16,580
all major aspects of data management
throughout the research life cycle.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,090
Here is a checklist for a data management
plan from the Digital Curation Center

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,010
that list questions that should
be addressed in the DMP.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,910
What data will you collect or create?

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,700
To answer this question, you should
provide a description of the data,

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,410
including the type, format, and volume,
with a justification of the format choice.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,890
If there are any storage implications
due to the format or volume of the data.

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,220
You should include these as well.

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,480
How will the data be collected or created?

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,190
Describe the data collection
methods to be used,

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,900
including the standards
that dictate these methods.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,000
You should also discuss your plans for
organizing data files and

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,370
applying version control,
as well as how quality assurance

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,130
protocols will be implemented during and
after data collection.

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,440
What documentation of metadata
will accompany the data?

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,040
It is important to determine what
information will be required to ensure

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,980
that the data be understandable to
secondary users of the data, or

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,090
for you and your team in the future.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,070
In other words, you should
describe the type of documentation

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,690
that will be needed to accompany the data
in order to interpret and use them.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,840
These documents might include
a description of the methodologies,

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,680
a codebook that provides variable and
value definitions, questionnaires or

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,250
instruments, or analysis procedures.

26
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,580
How will you manage any ethical issues?

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,350
The DMP should demonstrate

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,610
that you have considered critical
issues related to laws and guidelines.

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,870
Regarding the protection
of human subjects.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,240
If your project will conduct research
involving human participants,

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,940
you need to describe provisions for
protecting their confidentiality.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,370
This should include strategies for
handling and

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,141
storing sensitive data,
restricting access to sensitive data, and

34
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,920
preparing de-indentified datasets for
sharing.

35
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,570
How will you manage copyright and
intellectual property rights issues?

36
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,530
This is where legal issues of data
ownership need to be addressed.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,880
You need to identify the owner of the data
and their conditions for using the data.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,530
If you are reusing third-party
data particularly property data.

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,270
You should discuss permissions
with the data producer.

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,200
How will the data be stored and
backed up during research?

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,460
To answer this question, you should
describe provisions for storage.

42
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,550
And the degree to which they are adequate
for the type and size of your data.

43
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,850
Provisions for
storage should include plans for

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,510
systematic back ups of the data files.

45
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,580
How will you manage access and security.

46
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,450
If the data are sensitive or
should otherwise be restricted.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,040
To authorize project personnel.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,900
You should describe in
detail security measures

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,770
that will be in place to protect the data.

50
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,210
You also need to describe the standards
with which those security measures comply.

51
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,730
Which data should be retained,
shared, and/or preserved?

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,480
In thinking about how the data will
be used by others or by your team in

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,400
the future, you should make note of the
potential value of the data and the effort

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,540
that will be required to prepare
the datasets for preservation and access.

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,670
What is the long-term preservation
plan for the dataset?

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,330
Answering this question requires you
to identify the repository you will

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,680
use to archive the data and your plans
to prepare and document the data

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
to ensure that they will be preserved and
usable into the foreseeable future.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,960
How will you share the data?

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,850
Here you should identify the mechanism
you will use to share your data.

61
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,630
Describe how others might find your data
and how data files will be delivered.

62
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,080
You should also specify how you would like
others to acknowledge or sight your data.

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,390
Are any restrictions on
data sharing required?

64
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,430
Again, if privacy concerns affect
your ability to share project data,

65
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,640
you will need to discuss them and
how you will overcome these concerns

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,370
to enable data sharing whether by
providing anonymized versions of the data.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,280
Requiring a data use agreement or
other mechanisms.

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,370
You may also choose to place
an embargo on the data,

69
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,220
to ensure you have exclusive use
of the data for a period of time.

70
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,110
If this is the case,
you should explain why this is necessary.

71
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,630
Who will be responsible for
data management?

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,850
Quite simply, you need to identify,
by name if possible,

73
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,060
who will oversee the implementation
of the data management plan.

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,800
What resources will you require
to implement your plan?

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,550
For some projects with complex data,
whether due to type, size, or the fact

76
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,130
that project activities are geographically
distributed among different institutions,

77
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,190
data management might require specialized
expertise or special equipment.

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,624
You may also consider costs
associated with performing ongoing

79
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:56,238
data management tasks,
as well as the resources required for

80
00:05:56,238 --> 00:06:00,337
long-term preservation of
the data in a repository.

81
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:09,339
