00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,796
If this check list seems overwhelming,
don't worry.

2
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:15,770
There are multiple data management plan
tools available to use online for free.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,578
Two of these are the DMPTool produced
by the University of California,

4
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:27,420
Curation Center of
the California Digital Library

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,860
and DMPOnline developed by
the Digital Curation Centre.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,598
The DMPTool allows researchers to
create customized data management plans

7
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:47,000
via a step-by-step wizard based on
each funding agency's requirements.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,610
This wizard office resources,
help text and suggested answers

9
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,590
based on templates developed and
reviewed by information professionals

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,020
from the researches institution in
the California Digital Library.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,320
When funding agency policies change,
the DMPTool is updated.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,583
This ensures that the information
is up to date and

13
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:18,670
all new requirements are listed
in the DMPTool templates.

14
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:26,930
DMPOnline like the DMPTool is the DCC's
data management planning tool.

15
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,922
It offers guidance for researchers writing
DMPs and includes templates specific

16
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:38,837
to the requirements of UK funding agencies
and funding agencies outside the UK.

17
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:43,570
Institutions can also customize
templates via DMPOnline.

18
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,430
For more information, check out the videos
for these tools on the resources page.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,350
Writing a data management plan gets you
to think through data management issues

20
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,070
early on in the research life cycle.

21
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,477
By considering all of these issues,

22
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:05,134
you will not only be in compliance
with data management requirements,

23
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:10,120
you will also be better prepared to
implement data management strategies.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,175
Even if you aren't required to
write a data management plan,

25
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:19,171
this is a helpful process
to do better research.
