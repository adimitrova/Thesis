1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,390
We have covered a lot in this course.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,990
And as we have discussed,
data can come in many different forms.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,730
But despite the heterogeneity of data,
there are some basic data management

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,500
best practices that can help
researchers do better research.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,280
We hope that this course was helpful not
only to researchers who are needing to

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,340
actively manage their data and
share it at the end of a project but

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,560
also for information professional
who are supporting researchers.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,570
As we have covered in this course,
research data management is most

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,260
effective when it takes place throughout
the research data life cycle,

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,170
and the first step should include
writing a data management plan.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,100
As we discussed,
writing a DMP is not only best practice,

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,530
but it is increasingly
required by funding agencies.

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,220
After discussing DMPs and
some useful DMP tools,

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,200
the folks at the University of Edinburgh
covered some best practices related to

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
organizing data, file formats and
transformations, and storage and

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,389
security that can help when researchers
are actively working with their data.

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,140
We also discuss the benefits
of sharing data,

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,550
including promoting new research and
collaborations.

19
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,450
Allowing for the verification and
replication of original results and

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,350
enhancing the visibility
of research projects.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,620
These are just a few of the benefits, and

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,780
while the benefits can be numerous
we also covered various challenges

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,370
to sharing data from the effort it
takes to prepare data for sharing,

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,450
to the lack of incentives for sharing
data within the current academic culture.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,980
Finally, we went over the role of
trusted repositories in curating,

26
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,930
archiving and preserving data to
make sure it remains accessible, and

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,930
understandable for the long term.

28
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,100
All of the Cradle team would like to thank
you for participating in this course.

29
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,860
We would also like to thank the Institute
of Museum and Library Services for

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,000
sponsoring the creation of this mook.

31
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,340
And finally we would like to thank Sarah
Jones from the Digital Curation Center,

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,030
Adina and The Data Library at
the University of Edinburgh for

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,210
their contributions.

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,540
If you would like to continue your data
management education, we would encourage

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,400
you to check out the programs offered
at The School of Information and

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,990
Library Science here at UNC, including our
post master certificate in data curation.

37
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,720
And our forth coming professional
science masters in digital curation.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,770
Likewise, the Odum Institute at UNC
provides data management services

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,380
to researchers that can help ease their
burden as well as training information

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,940
professionals and researchers in data
management and curation best practices.

41
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,660
Check out the resources for additional
information on other data management

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,430
training and education opportunities.

43
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,507
Bye and thanks for participating.

44
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:32,507
