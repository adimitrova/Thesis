that we discussed 
archival ingest process storage, 
data management access to use 
oais language, a sip becomes dip 
we will continue looking two 
remaining oais functional entities 
well 
archival best practices 
monishing overall repository 
environment, preservation planning 
function provides recommendations 
preservation planning strategies 
to ensure that data accessible 
understandable to users time 
recommendations often include 
migration emulation 
to protect data 
loss due to obsolescence, 
data repositories migrate digital content 
date storage media 
software formats to to date ones 
this practice may done automatically 
within a preservation system 
an archivist may 
migrate content manually 
another option is emulation, 
emulation involves recreation 
original computer environment allowing 
users to access digital object 
whatever strategy, preservation 
planning involves ongoing evaluation 
archival materials to identify 
file migration requirements 
recommends changes to archive processes 
policies reports risks 
beyond archive, preservation 
planning function also monitors 
technology landscape 
uses service requirements 
adapts preservation 
recommendations accordingly 
successful implementation 
preservation strategies 
overall operations archive 
relies administration 
function to handle data submission 
agreements data producers, 
establish quality standards, 
manage infrastructure configurations 
much this is part ongoing monitoring 
assessment archive operations 
along implementing monitoring 
data archiving operations workflows, 
a repository also must able 
to demonstrate organizational, 
physical economic stability 
a trustworthy repository weather 
storm personnel transitions, 
infrastructure mishaps 
tightly resourced environments, 
without disruption in 
preservation activities 
however, there always 
unforeseen circumstances 
that potentially result 
in organizational failure 
to deal cases, repositories may 
enter collaborative partnerships 
one example is 
data preservation alliance, 
social sciences datapass 
datapass partners a formal 
agreement to take stewardship 
a partners collection, 
that organization become defunct 
a common protection physical 
losses disasters is storing 
copies digital content in 
geographically distributed locations 
repositories employee lockss 
system, lots copies keep stuff safe 
stores copies content 
partner servers across 
geographically diverse regions 
economics sustainability 
long term preservation is an ongoing 
concern in field data archiving 
cost long term 
preservation still largely unclear 
regardless, a trustworthy repository 
in place shortterm longterm 
business plans sustainability 
transparent accounting practices 
also analyze 
document financial risks, investments 
expenditures to anticipate costs 
prepare necessary budgets 
you see archiving data 
properly is trivial undertaking 
receiving file submissions 
data producers, 
to making data files 
accessible to public 
trustworthy data repositories make 
a verifiable commitment to archiving data 
expend significant amounts labor, 
funding, research 
assessment to safeguard data 
this is is important to make 
data repositories an integral part 
data management planning 
trust to take care data 
while you take care research
