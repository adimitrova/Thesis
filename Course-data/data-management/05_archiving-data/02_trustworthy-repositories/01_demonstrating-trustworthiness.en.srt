2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:10,827
In the previous lesson, we learned
the importance of preserving data and

3
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:15,833
some key concepts involved in properly
seeing to their long-term preservation

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:20,410
including authenticity, integrity,
and the assignment of metadata.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,385
Now, we will go into more depth concerning
the role of trustworthy repositories and

6
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:31,880
workflows, procedures, and
best practices for archiving data.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,660
By the end of this lesson,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,220
you will recognize the benefits
of trustworthy repositories.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,100
Understand the role of audit
certifications in demonstrating

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,990
trustworthiness, and be able to identify
key archival standards and best practices.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,430
Because data preservation is an active and
ongoing process, data repositories

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,210
are best suited to oversee the long-term
storage and preservation of data.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,448
There are different types of repositories,
or archives, including domain,

14
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:07,990
institutional, and location-specific,
each having special expertise.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,070
These varying types of repositories often
have different scopes and missions.

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,820
There is no one size fits all repository,
and assessing the strengths and

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,470
weaknesses of each will help researchers
select the best home for their data.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,140
It is also important for

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,990
the researcher to talk to repository staff
early in the research data life cycle,

20
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,620
rather than at the very end
when the project is over, and

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,150
you have to figure out how to prepare your
data files for submission to a repository.

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,500
A logical time to contact repositories

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,160
is when you are writing
your data management plan.

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,410
Repository staff can assist researchers
in understanding any specific

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,470
data management requirements,
such as accepted file types,

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,450
metadata standards,
documentation requirements, and

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,070
associated costs, information that should
be included in the data management plan.

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,070
How do you know that the data
repository is one that you can trust

29
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,470
with your data for years to come?

30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,980
Since the data repository will be charged
with the long term maintenance and

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,700
preservation of a researcher's data,

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,260
you will want to be sure the repository
is a trustworthy steward.

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,220
Researchers and
practitioners in the digital archiving and

34
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,340
preservation fields have
established specific standards and

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,950
best practices for the long term
preservation of digital objects.

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,110
A repository that is trustworthy is one
that can show compliance to standards and

37
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,570
best practices through policies and

38
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,200
procedures that are both transparent and
well documented.

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,590
Adhering to standards and

40
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,709
best practices is essential to
achieving trust worthiness.

41
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,050
However, for repositories to
demonstrate their trustworthiness,

42
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,250
they must commit to transparency and
seek audit and certification.

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,270
Without transparent policies and
procedures,

44
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,570
assessing trustworthiness of
a repository is all but impossible.

45
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,570
Transparency requires that
repositories make archival and

46
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,000
digital preservation policies readily
available to stakeholders off and online.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,210
Digital preservation policies, access and
use policies, data security policies,

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,020
metadata policies, and others should
be clear and understandable to users.

49
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,180
This is an important aspect of
communicating repository services and

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,740
capabilities to users,

51
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,330
which gives assurances that their
data are being properly cared for.

52
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,000
Another mechanism for repositories
to demonstrate their trustworthiness

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,310
is through audit and certification.

54
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,330
Three well known examples of audit schemes
are DRAMBORA, the Data Seal of Approval,

55
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,050
and the ISO 16363 Audit and Certification
of Trustworthy Digital Repositories.

56
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,907
Each provides detailed guidelines or
specific criteria for

57
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:16,901
assessing the trustworthiness of digital
repositories based on adherence,

58
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,108
standards, and best practices.

59
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,112
Odd its may be completed using
a self assessment process,

60
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,318
a peer review process,
or an external audit.

61
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:30,230
Self-audits like DRAMBORA are useful tools

62
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,030
that enable repositories to
examine their own policies and

63
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,920
procedures against benchmarks to
identify areas for improvement.

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,230
DRAMBORA, which stands for

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,490
Digital Repository Audit Method
based on risk assessment,

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,950
was developed by the Digital Curation
Center and Digital Preservation in Europe.

67
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,920
DRAMBORA offers a tool kit that guides the
archivist through a structured process to

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,540
analyze the scope of the repository,
repository activities and

69
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,680
assets, risks and vulnerabilities,
and calculations of risks.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,130
It also allows the archivist to
define risk management measures, and

71
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,730
produces self audit report.

72
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,930
Self audits are often the first
step toward external audits

73
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,420
which can be more rigorous and
labor intensive.

74
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,412
The data seal of approval
from the data archiving and

75
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:31,761
network surfaces or dense is a low
vary of option for external audit and

76
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:37,386
certification through peer review
trustworthiness is judged according

77
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:42,668
to 16 guidelines each of which
falls into one of three categories.

78
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,411
Guidelines related to data producers.

79
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,540
Guidelines related to repositories.

80
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,700
And guidelines related to data consumers.

81
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,740
These guidelines align with a list
of specific criteria, that if met,

82
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,860
deem a repository worthy
of a data seal of approval.

83
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,520
To be considered trustworthy,
the repository must present public facing

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,930
documentation, that demonstrates that
the data can be found on the internet.

85
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,820
The data are accessible with
clear rights and licenses,

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,500
the data are in a usable format,
the data are reliable, and

87
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,530
the data are identified in a unique and
persistent way.

88
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,950
More rigorous is the ISO 16363 audit and

89
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,600
certification of trustworthy
digital repositories standard.

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,070
It isn't enough for repositories
to claim that it is trustworthy.

91
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,335
ISO 16363 demands extensive evidence.

92
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:42,539
The audit examines
repository attributes and

93
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,720
responsibilities in three
principle categories.

94
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,180
Organizational infrastructure,
digital object management, and

95
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,490
infrastructure and
security risk management.

96
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,980
Each of these categories
presents a series of metrics

97
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,300
with which an auditor can judge
repository effectiveness.

98
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,190
For each metric, the repository must
be able to demonstrate conformance by

99
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,320
presenting actual evidence, such as
policy documents, accounting budgets,

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,940
training materials, system logs,
contracts, and licenses.

101
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,210
Our repository that has earned
ISO 16363 certification is

102
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,680
able to present evidence of
conformance to over a hundred metrics.

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,900
While achieving this certification is
rigorous, it is the most thorough and

104
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,930
comprehensive today, and
considered the gold standard.

105
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,570
It is important to note that audits
should be performed routinely and

106
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,290
periodically, especially since
technology is rapidly changing and

107
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,893
can significantly impact workflows and
processes.

108
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:55,700
With regular audits, repositories
demonstrate to their stakeholders

109
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,228
that they are trusted data stewards.

110
