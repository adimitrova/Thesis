in previous lesson, we learned 
importance preserving data 
key concepts involved in properly 
seeing to longterm preservation 
including authenticity, integrity, 
assignment metadata 
now, we will go depth concerning 
role trustworthy repositories 
workflows, procedures, 
best practices archiving data 
end this lesson, 
you will recognize benefits 
trustworthy repositories 
understand role audit 
certifications in demonstrating 
trustworthiness, able to identify 
key archival standards best practices 
data preservation is an active 
ongoing process, data repositories 
best suited to oversee longterm 
storage preservation data 
there different types repositories, 
archives, including domain, 
institutional, locationspecific, 
special expertise 
varying types repositories often 
different scopes missions 
there is one size fits repository, 
assessing strengths 
weaknesses will help researchers 
select best home data 
is also important 
researcher to talk to repository staff 
early in research data life cycle, 
rather end 
project is over, 
you to figure to prepare 
data files submission to a repository 
a logical time to contact repositories 
is you writing 
data management plan 
repository staff assist researchers 
in understanding specific 
data management requirements, 
accepted file types, 
metadata standards, 
documentation requirements, 
associated costs, information that 
included in data management plan 
you know that data 
repository is one that you trust 
data years to come 
since data repository will charged 
long term maintenance 
preservation a researchers data, 
you will want to sure repository 
is a trustworthy steward 
researchers 
practitioners in digital archiving 
preservation fields 
established specific standards 
best practices long term 
preservation digital objects 
a repository that is trustworthy is one 
that show compliance to standards 
best practices policies 
procedures that transparent 
well documented 
adhering to standards 
best practices is essential to 
achieving trust worthiness 
however, repositories to 
demonstrate trustworthiness, 
must commit to transparency 
seek audit certification 
without transparent policies 
procedures, 
assessing trustworthiness 
a repository is impossible 
transparency requires that 
repositories make archival 
digital preservation policies readily 
available to stakeholders online 
digital preservation policies, access 
use policies, data security policies, 
metadata policies, others 
clear understandable to users 
this is an important aspect 
communicating repository services 
capabilities to users, 
gives assurances that 
data properly cared 
another mechanism repositories 
to demonstrate trustworthiness 
is audit certification 
three well known examples audit schemes 
drambora, data seal approval, 
iso audit certification 
trustworthy digital repositories 
provides detailed guidelines 
specific criteria 
assessing trustworthiness digital 
repositories based adherence, 
standards, best practices 
odd may completed using 
a self assessment process, 
a peer review process, 
an external audit 
selfaudits like drambora useful tools 
that enable repositories to 
examine policies 
procedures benchmarks to 
identify areas improvement 
drambora, stands 
digital repository audit method 
based risk assessment, 
developed digital curation 
center digital preservation in europe 
drambora offers a tool kit that guides 
archivist a structured process to 
analyze scope repository, 
repository activities 
assets, risks vulnerabilities, 
calculations risks 
also allows archivist to 
define risk management measures, 
produces self audit report 
self audits often first 
step toward external audits 
rigorous 
labor intensive 
data seal approval 
data archiving 
network surfaces dense is a low 
vary option external audit 
certification peer review 
trustworthiness is judged according 
to guidelines 
falls one three categories 
guidelines related to data producers 
guidelines related to repositories 
guidelines related to data consumers 
guidelines align a list 
specific criteria, that if met, 
deem a repository worthy 
a data seal approval 
to considered trustworthy, 
repository must present public facing 
documentation, that demonstrates that 
data found internet 
data accessible 
clear rights licenses, 
data in a usable format, 
data reliable, 
data identified in a unique 
persistent way 
rigorous is iso audit 
certification trustworthy 
digital repositories standard 
isnt enough repositories 
to claim that is trustworthy 
iso demands extensive evidence 
audit examines 
repository attributes 
responsibilities in three 
principle categories 
organizational infrastructure, 
digital object management, 
infrastructure 
security risk management 
categories 
presents a series metrics 
an auditor judge 
repository effectiveness 
metric, repository must 
able to demonstrate conformance 
presenting actual evidence, 
policy documents, accounting budgets, 
training materials, system logs, 
contracts, licenses 
repository that earned 
iso certification is 
able to present evidence 
conformance to a hundred metrics 
while achieving this certification is 
rigorous, is thorough 
comprehensive today, 
considered gold standard 
is important to note that audits 
performed routinely 
periodically, especially since 
technology is rapidly changing 
significantly impact workflows 
processes 
regular audits, repositories 
demonstrate to stakeholders 
that trusted data stewards
