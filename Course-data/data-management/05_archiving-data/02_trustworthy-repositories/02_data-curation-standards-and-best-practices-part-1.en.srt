2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:11,367
At the foundation of many
archival standards is ISO 14721,

3
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:17,720
reference model for an open archival
information system, or OAIS.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,980
This reference model presents
a high-level framework For

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,920
understanding archival concepts, defines
elements & processes within digital

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,130
repositories, and
establishes a set of responsibilities for

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,590
the long-term preservation
of digital information.

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,090
Repositories that consider themselves
to be OAIS archives are presumed

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,880
to have mechanisms and workflows in place
to properly safeguard digital materials.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,610
These mechanisms and workflows serve the
specific archiving needs of the designated

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,160
community, which OAIS defines as
an identified group of potential

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,350
consumers who should be able to understand
a particular set of information.

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,930
While the definition of designated
community might change over time,

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,040
the archive accepts responsibility for
the long-term preservation and

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,600
availability of information for
that designated community.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,870
The OAIS model has six
functional entities.

17
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,010
Ingest, archival storage,
data management, administration,

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,850
preservation and access, and
illustrate the data curation and

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,720
archiving workflows that takes place from
the time a researcher submits his or

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,700
her data to when a third-party
user accesses the data.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,050
When a repository receives data files,

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,440
also known as the submission information
package or SIP, from the data producer,

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,120
the ingest function performs several tasks
to establish evidence of authenticity and

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,550
to ensure that files are in proper formats
and include necessary documentation.

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,330
Standard ingest procedures include
normalization of files to formats

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,307
that are optimal for
long-term preservation.

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,630
Optimal formats are determined
based on careful consideration of

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,570
sustainability and use factors that
can affect the feasibility and

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,360
cost of long-term file preservation.

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,270
For instance, if a researcher submits
an spss.sav data file to a repository,

31
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,131
the repository may normalize the data file
into a tab-delimited preservation format.

32
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,250
SPSS is a proprietary statistical
analysis software program owned by IBM,

33
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,980
a private company.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,690
SPSS has had its share of
new versions over the years,

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,680
leaving old files unable to be rendered
properly by the latest versions.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,070
Such old files are externally dependent
on a computer running certain versions of

37
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,720
the software, and only if the computer's
operating system supports that software.

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,260
Even for those skilled enough
to hack software code,

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,760
many proprietary formats
are not transparent,

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,570
making it impossible to access,
much less modify or update the code.

41
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,970
During ingest,
the repository will convert the SPSS

42
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,185
file into a tab delimited format,
which is widely adopted,

43
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:28,050
non-proprietary or open source, and
free from external dependencies.

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,270
Preservation optimization also presumes
that the stamp includes supplementary

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,570
documentation that enables appropriate
interpretation and use of the data.

46
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,170
The Ingest functional entity ensures
that SIPs have all the necessary

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,770
components that make data preservation,
access, and reuse possible.

48
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,600
During Ingest, the repository also
performs the initial checksum or

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,342
hashsum on SIP files.

50
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:03,680
A checksum is produced using an algorithm
that generates a unique string combination

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,620
that is specific to the arrangement
of bits contained in the data files.

52
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,610
This unique string combination can
be used to detect any changes to

53
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,120
files resulting from corruption that
may occur inadvertently over time,

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
which is essential to
demonstrating a file's integrity.

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,470
Because data are digital objects
with specific attributes,

56
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,750
data repositories may perform
additional tasks during ingest,

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,390
including checks for confidential
information and data quality reviews.

58
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,110
Once ingest tasks have been completed,

59
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,720
the SIP is considered to be an archival
information package, or AIP.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,230
The archival storage
function oversees storage,

61
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,650
maintenance and retrieval of the AIP.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,190
Once the AIP is moved into permanent
storage, the archival storage function

63
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,780
manages storage hierarchy,
performs routine error checking,

64
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,380
refreshes storage media, and
recovers files in the event of a disaster.

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,220
Meanwhile, the data management function
provides functionality for generating,

66
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,640
maintaining, and
accessing descriptive information,

67
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,630
ie metadata, to document the files
housed in archival storage.

68
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,110
It also administers archival database
functions to include database management,

69
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,280
updates, and queries.

70
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,000
Once the AIP files are placed
in permanent storage,

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,870
the customer can request access and
retrieve data files.

72
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,690
This service and functionality is
provided by the access function,

73
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,346
which coordinates these requests and
assembles and

74
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:53,431
delivers the final dissemination
information package or DIP to users.
