2
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:11,390
Now that we have discussed
the archival ingest process storage,

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,654
data management and access or to use
OAIS language, have a sip becomes dip.

4
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:22,503
We will continue looking at the two
remaining OAIS functional entities

5
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:26,470
as well as some other
archival best practices.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,470
For monishing the overall repository
environment, the preservation planning

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,350
function provides recommendations for
preservation and planning strategies

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,920
to ensure that data are accessible and
understandable to users over time.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,140
These recommendations often include
migration and or emulation.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,750
To protect against data
loss due to obsolescence,

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,310
data repositories migrate digital content
from out of date storage media or

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,810
software formats to more up to date ones.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,540
This practice may be done automatically
within a preservation system or

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,320
an archivist who may
migrate content manually.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,510
Another option is emulation,
emulation involves the recreation of

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,870
the original computer environment allowing
users to access the digital object.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,340
Whatever the strategy, preservation
planning involves ongoing evaluation

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,809
of archival materials to identify
file migration requirements.

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,100
Recommends changes to archive processes
and policies and reports any risks.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,520
Beyond the archive, the preservation
planning function also monitors

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,080
the technology landscape and
uses service requirements and

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,010
adapts preservation
recommendations accordingly.

23
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,630
The successful implementation
of preservation strategies and

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,480
the overall operations of the archive
relies on the administration

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,790
function to handle data submission
agreements with data producers,

26
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:14,680
establish quality standards, and
manage infrastructure configurations.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Much of this is part of ongoing monitoring
and assessment of archive operations.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,660
Along with implementing and monitoring
data archiving operations and workflows,

29
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,490
a repository also must be able
to demonstrate organizational,

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,590
physical and economic stability.

31
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,220
A trustworthy repository can weather
the storm of personnel transitions,

32
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,950
infrastructure mishaps and
tightly resourced environments,

33
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,610
without any disruption in
preservation activities.

34
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,380
However, there are always
unforeseen circumstances

35
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,530
that can potentially result
in organizational failure.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,060
To deal with such cases, repositories may
enter into collaborative partnerships.

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,650
One example is
the Data Preservation Alliance, for

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,404
the Social Sciences or Data-PASS.

39
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:12,483
Data-PASS partners have a formal
agreement to take on stewardship

40
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:18,018
of a partner's collection,
should that organization become defunct?

41
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:22,839
A common protection against physical
losses from disasters is storing

42
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:27,670
copies of digital content in
geographically distributed locations.

43
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,460
Some repositories employee the LOCKSS
system, Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe.

44
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,920
Which stores copies of content on

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,860
partner servers across
geographically diverse regions.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,530
Economics sustainability for

47
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,130
long term preservation is an ongoing
concern in the field of data archiving

48
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,390
because the cost of long term
preservation are still largely unclear.

49
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,340
Regardless, a trustworthy repository has
in place both short-term and long-term

50
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,160
business plans for sustainability with
transparent accounting practices.

51
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:13,500
They also analyze and
document financial risks, investments and

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,070
expenditures to anticipate costs and
prepare necessary budgets.

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,880
As you can see archiving data
properly is no trivial undertaking.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,400
From receiving file submissions
from data producers,

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,590
to making data files
accessible to the public.

56
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,730
Trustworthy data repositories make
a verifiable commitment to archiving data.

57
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,990
They expend significant amounts of labor,
funding, research and

58
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,580
assessment to safeguard data.

59
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,180
This is why it is important to make
data repositories an integral part

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,710
of your data management planning.

61
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,210
Trust them to take care of your data
while you take care of your research.

62
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,439
