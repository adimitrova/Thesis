now
that
we
have
discussed
the
archival
ingest
process
storage
,
data
management
and
access
or
to
use
oais
language
,
have
a
sip
becomes
dip
.
we
will
continue
looking
at
the
two
remaining
oais
functional
entities
as
well
as
some
other
archival
best
practices
.
for
monishing
the
overall
repository
environment
,
the
preservation
planning
function
provides
recommendations
for
preservation
and
planning
strategies
to
ensure
that
data
are
accessible
and
understandable
to
users
over
time
.
these
recommendations
often
include
migration
and
or
emulation
.
to
protect
against
data
loss
due
to
obsolescence
,
data
repositories
migrate
digital
content
from
out
of
date
storage
media
or
software
formats
to
more
up
to
date
ones
.
this
practice
may
be
done
automatically
within
a
preservation
system
or
an
archivist
who
may
migrate
content
manually
.
another
option
is
emulation
,
emulation
involves
the
recreation
of
the
original
computer
environment
allowing
users
to
access
the
digital
object
.
whatever
the
strategy
,
preservation
planning
involves
ongoing
evaluation
of
archival
materials
to
identify
file
migration
requirements
.
recommends
changes
to
archive
processes
and
policies
and
reports
any
risks
.
beyond
the
archive
,
the
preservation
planning
function
also
monitors
the
technology
landscape
and
uses
service
requirements
and
adapts
preservation
recommendations
accordingly
.
the
successful
implementation
of
preservation
strategies
and
the
overall
operations
of
the
archive
relies
on
the
administration
function
to
handle
data
submission
agreements
with
data
producers
,
establish
quality
standards
,
and
manage
infrastructure
configurations
.
much
of
this
is
part
of
ongoing
monitoring
and
assessment
of
archive
operations
.
along
with
implementing
and
monitoring
data
archiving
operations
and
workflows
,
a
repository
also
must
be
able
to
demonstrate
organizational
,
physical
and
economic
stability
.
a
trustworthy
repository
can
weather
the
storm
of
personnel
transitions
,
infrastructure
mishaps
and
tightly
resourced
environments
,
without
any
disruption
in
preservation
activities
.
however
,
there
are
always
unforeseen
circumstances
that
can
potentially
result
in
organizational
failure
.
to
deal
with
such
cases
,
repositories
may
enter
into
collaborative
partnerships
.
one
example
is
the
data
preservation
alliance
,
for
the
social
sciences
or
data-pass
.
data-pass
partners
have
a
formal
agreement
to
take
on
stewardship
of
a
partner
's
collection
,
should
that
organization
become
defunct
?
a
common
protection
against
physical
losses
from
disasters
is
storing
copies
of
digital
content
in
geographically
distributed
locations
.
some
repositories
employee
the
lockss
system
,
lots
of
copies
keep
stuff
safe
.
which
stores
copies
of
content
on
partner
servers
across
geographically
diverse
regions
.
economics
sustainability
for
long
term
preservation
is
an
ongoing
concern
in
the
field
of
data
archiving
because
the
cost
of
long
term
preservation
are
still
largely
unclear
.
regardless
,
a
trustworthy
repository
has
in
place
both
short-term
and
long-term
business
plans
for
sustainability
with
transparent
accounting
practices
.
they
also
analyze
and
document
financial
risks
,
investments
and
expenditures
to
anticipate
costs
and
prepare
necessary
budgets
.
as
you
can
see
archiving
data
properly
is
no
trivial
undertaking
.
from
receiving
file
submissions
from
data
producers
,
to
making
data
files
accessible
to
the
public
.
trustworthy
data
repositories
make
a
verifiable
commitment
to
archiving
data
.
they
expend
significant
amounts
of
labor
,
funding
,
research
and
assessment
to
safeguard
data
.
this
is
why
it
is
important
to
make
data
repositories
an
integral
part
of
your
data
management
planning
.
trust
them
to
take
care
of
your
data
while
you
take
care
of
your
research
.
