archival standards is iso , 
reference model an open archival 
information system, oais 
this reference model presents 
a highlevel framework 
understanding archival concepts, defines 
elements processes within digital 
repositories, 
establishes a set responsibilities 
longterm preservation 
digital information 
repositories that consider 
to oais archives presumed 
to mechanisms workflows in place 
to properly safeguard digital materials 
mechanisms workflows serve 
specific archiving needs designated 
community, oais defines 
an identified group potential 
consumers able to understand 
a particular set information 
while definition designated 
community might change time, 
archive accepts responsibility 
longterm preservation 
availability information 
that designated community 
oais model six 
functional entities 
ingest, archival storage, 
data management, administration, 
preservation access, 
illustrate data curation 
archiving workflows that takes place 
time a researcher submits 
data to a thirdparty 
user accesses data 
a repository receives data files, 
also known submission information 
package sip, data producer, 
ingest function performs several tasks 
to establish evidence authenticity 
to ensure that files in proper formats 
include necessary documentation 
standard ingest procedures include 
normalization files to formats 
that optimal 
longterm preservation 
optimal formats determined 
based careful consideration 
sustainability use factors that 
affect feasibility 
cost longterm file preservation 
instance, if a researcher submits 
an spsssav data file to a repository, 
repository may normalize data file 
a tabdelimited preservation format 
spss is a proprietary statistical 
analysis software program owned ibm, 
a private company 
spss share 
new versions years, 
leaving old files unable to rendered 
properly latest versions 
old files externally dependent 
a computer running certain versions 
software, if computers 
operating system supports that software 
even skilled enough 
to hack software code, 
many proprietary formats 
transparent, 
making impossible to access, 
much less modify update code 
ingest, 
repository will convert spss 
file a tab delimited format, 
is widely adopted, 
nonproprietary open source, 
free external dependencies 
preservation optimization also presumes 
that stamp includes supplementary 
documentation that enables appropriate 
interpretation use data 
ingest functional entity ensures 
that sips necessary 
components that make data preservation, 
access, reuse possible 
ingest, repository also 
performs initial checksum 
hashsum sip files 
a checksum is produced using an algorithm 
that generates a unique string combination 
that is specific to arrangement 
bits contained in data files 
this unique string combination 
used to detect changes to 
files resulting corruption that 
may occur inadvertently time, 
is essential to 
demonstrating a files integrity 
data digital objects 
specific attributes, 
data repositories may perform 
additional tasks ingest, 
including checks confidential 
information data quality reviews 
ingest tasks completed, 
sip is considered to an archival 
information package, aip 
archival storage 
function oversees storage, 
maintenance retrieval aip 
aip is moved permanent 
storage, archival storage function 
manages storage hierarchy, 
performs routine error checking, 
refreshes storage media, 
recovers files in event a disaster 
meanwhile, data management function 
provides functionality generating, 
maintaining, 
accessing descriptive information, 
ie metadata, to document files 
housed in archival storage 
also administers archival database 
functions to include database management, 
updates, queries 
aip files placed 
in permanent storage, 
customer request access 
retrieve data files 
this service functionality is 
provided access function, 
coordinates requests 
assembles 
delivers final dissemination
