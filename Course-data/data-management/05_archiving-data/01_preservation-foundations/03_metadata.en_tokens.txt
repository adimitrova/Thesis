now
it
's
time
to
discuss
a
very
important
topic
that
is
near
and
dear
to
the
hearts
and
minds
of
information
professionals
.
metadata
,
as
you
learned
in
a
previous
module
metadata
is
often
defined
as
data
about
data
.
more
specifically
and
more
accurately
,
metadata
refers
to
structured
information
that
describes
,
explains
,
locates
or
otherwise
represents
something
else
.
metadata
,
which
is
preserved
along
side
the
data
makes
it
possible
to
retrieve
,
use
or
manage
an
information
resource
.
metadata
is
necessary
for
resource
discovery
,
organization
of
electronic
resources
,
interoperability
across
systems
,
digital
identification
of
data
and
archiving
and
preserving
data
.
metadata
comes
in
three
forms
.
descriptive
,
administrative
and
structural
.
descriptive
metadata
describes
a
work
for
the
purposes
of
discovery
and
identification
.
descriptive
metadata
includes
information
such
as
the
title
,
author
and
abstract
.
this
is
the
type
of
information
that
makes
it
possible
to
find
the
data
you
're
looking
for
.
and
to
verify
that
what
you
've
found
is
indeed
what
you
need
.
the
dublin
core
metadata
element
set
is
often
considered
core
metadata
or
simple
and
concise
resource
description
.
administrative
metadata
is
structured
information
regarding
the
management
and
tracking
of
data
over
a
period
of
time
.
it
may
tell
us
the
file
type
,
when
the
file
was
created
and
who
was
permitted
to
access
and
use
the
data
file
.
administrative
metadata
can
be
one
of
two
types
,
rights
management
or
preservation
metadata
.
rights
management
metadata
deals
with
intellectual
property
rights
.
preservation
metadata
records
information
necessary
to
properly
archive
and
preserve
digital
materials
.
premis
,
which
stands
for
preservation
metadata
implementation
strategies
,
is
a
widely
adopted
metadata
standard
.
that
includes
both
rights
management
and
preservation
metadata
.
premis
defines
in
the
data
dictionary
what
repository
should
know
about
the
intellectual
entities
,
objects
,
agents
,
events
and
rights
associated
with
the
preservation
landscape
.
structural
metadata
describes
the
physical
or
logical
structure
of
digital
objects
.
for
data
,
structural
metadata
indicates
how
data
elements
are
assembled
into
a
single
data
set
.
for
instance
,
a
typical
data
set
has
a
set
of
variables
and
values
.
for
a
set
of
observations
,
structural
metadata
allows
us
to
understand
how
these
pieces
are
packaged
within
the
dataset
.
the
data
documentation
initiative
or
ddi
,
metadata
specification
,
includes
structural
metadata
elements
that
allow
us
to
describe
social
science
data
at
the
variable
level
.
these
elements
include
variable
identification
,
value
categories
and
location
of
variables
within
the
larger
data
set
.
many
metadata
standards
also
specify
formatting
conventions
and
control
vocabularies
for
metadata
entries
.
have
you
ever
tried
to
find
something
in
a
database
or
some
other
information
resource
?
but
when
you
performed
a
search
,
your
query
returned
no
results
,
even
though
you
knew
for
sure
the
information
was
in
there
?
it
happens
all
the
time
and
bad
metadata
was
likely
to
blame
.
good
metadata
are
based
on
metadata
standards
,
which
often
require
adherence
to
specific
representation
rules
and
controlled
vocabularies
.
representation
rules
dictate
character
formatting
to
ensure
consistency
in
data
entry
.
for
example
data
sites
representation
rules
requires
that
in
the
creator
name
element
the
name
be
entered
with
the
family
name
first
and
the
given
name
after
.
john
smith
should
be
entered
as
smith
,
john
.
controlled
vocabularies
prescribe
an
authoritative
list
of
terms
to
be
used
to
express
values
and
metadata
elements
.
ddi
's
controlled
vocabulary
provides
a
list
of
terms
to
be
used
in
ddi
metadata
elements
.
any
time
of
formal
entity
whether
it
be
in
the
association
,
business
,
political
party
or
school
.
should
be
referred
to
as
organization
in
the
ddi
analysis
unit
element
.
good
standardized
meta
data
also
allows
multiple
systems
with
different
hardware
and
software
platforms
.
data
structures
and
interfaces
to
exchange
data
with
a
minimal
loss
of
content
and
functionality
.
the
open
archive
initiative
protocol
for
metadata
harvesting
,
or
oai-pmh
,
demonstrates
how
standardized
metadata
can
be
shared
across
distributed
systems
.
oai-pmh
is
a
low
entry
interoperability
framework
that
facilitates
the
efficient
dissemination
of
digital
materials
.
it
allows
one
system
to
grab
or
harvest
the
metadata
from
multiple
repositories
to
make
the
data
searchable
from
a
single
interface
.
oai-pmh
submits
one
of
seven
http
requests
which
returns
an
xml
metadata
file
with
the
requests
records
.
the
success
of
this
is
very
much
dependent
upon
good
metadata
.
to
review
,
good
metadata
is
standardized
,
consistent
and
interoperable
,
and
facilitates
discovery
,
preservation
and
archiving
of
data
.
