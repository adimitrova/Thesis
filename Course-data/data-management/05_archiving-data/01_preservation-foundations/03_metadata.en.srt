2
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:10,542
Now it's time to discuss a very
important topic that is near and

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:15,350
dear to the hearts and
minds of information professionals.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,220
Metadata, as you learned in
a previous module metadata

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,530
is often defined as data about data.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,140
More specifically and more accurately,
metadata refers to structured information

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,000
that describes, explains, locates or
otherwise represents something else.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,040
Metadata, which is preserved along side
the data makes it possible to retrieve,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,399
use or manage an information resource.

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,350
Metadata is necessary for
resource discovery, organization of

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,850
electronic resources,
interoperability across systems,

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,340
digital identification of data and
archiving and preserving data.

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,890
Metadata comes in three forms.

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,800
Descriptive, administrative and
structural.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,840
Descriptive metadata describes a work for
the purposes of discovery and

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,690
identification.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,630
Descriptive metadata includes information
such as the title, author and abstract.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,880
This is the type of information
that makes it possible

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,570
to find the data you're looking for.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,950
And to verify that what you've
found is indeed what you need.

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,090
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
is often considered core metadata or

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,420
simple and concise resource description.

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,370
Administrative metadata is structured
information regarding the management and

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,800
tracking of data over a period of time.

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,030
It may tell us the file type,
when the file was created and

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,260
who was permitted to access and
use the data file.

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,920
Administrative metadata
can be one of two types,

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,160
rights management or
preservation metadata.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,870
Rights management metadata deals
with intellectual property rights.

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,900
Preservation metadata records information
necessary to properly archive and

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,380
preserve digital materials.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,650
PREMIS, which stands for Preservation
Metadata Implementation Strategies,

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,560
is a widely adopted metadata standard.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,120
That includes both rights management and
preservation metadata.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,260
PREMIS defines in the data dictionary
what repository should know about

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,430
the intellectual entities,
objects, agents, events and

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,500
rights associated with
the preservation landscape.

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,490
Structural metadata describes the physical
or logical structure of digital objects.

39
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,280
For data, structural metadata
indicates how data elements

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,070
are assembled into a single data set.

41
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,390
For instance, a typical data set
has a set of variables and values.

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,340
For a set of observations, structural
metadata allows us to understand

43
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,930
how these pieces are packaged
within the dataset.

44
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,470
The Data Documentation Initiative or DDI,

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,240
metadata specification,
includes structural metadata elements

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,740
that allow us to describe social
science data at the variable level.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,610
These elements include variable
identification, value categories and

48
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,750
location of variables
within the larger data set.

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,120
Many metadata standards also
specify formatting conventions and

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,490
control vocabularies for metadata entries.

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,570
Have you ever tried to find
something in a database or

52
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,320
some other information resource?

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,600
But when you performed a search,
your query returned no results,

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,710
even though you knew for
sure the information was in there?

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,110
It happens all the time and
bad metadata was likely to blame.

56
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,460
Good metadata are based on metadata
standards, which often require

57
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,380
adherence to specific representation
rules and controlled vocabularies.

58
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,970
Representation rules dictate
character formatting

59
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,060
to ensure consistency in data entry.

60
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,160
For example data sites
representation rules requires that

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,620
in the creator name element the name be
entered with the family name first and

62
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,450
the given name after.

63
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,520
John Smith should be entered as Smith,
John.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,284
Controlled vocabularies prescribe
an authoritative list of terms to be

65
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:41,415
used to express values and
metadata elements.

66
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:46,314
DDI's controlled vocabulary provides
a list of terms to be used in

67
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:48,950
DDI metadata elements.

68
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,920
Any time of formal entity whether
it be in the association, business,

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,900
political party or school.

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,230
Should be referred to as organization
in the DDI analysis unit element.

71
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,480
Good standardized meta data also allows
multiple systems with different hardware

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,140
and software platforms.

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,820
Data structures and

74
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,600
interfaces to exchange data with a minimal
loss of content and functionality.

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,039
The open archive initiative protocol for
metadata harvesting, or OAI-PMH,

76
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,898
demonstrates how standardized metadata
can be shared across distributed systems.

77
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:31,096
OAI-PMH is a low entry
interoperability framework that

78
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:36,560
facilitates the efficient
dissemination of digital materials.

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,182
It allows one system to grab or
harvest the metadata from multiple

80
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:45,983
repositories to make the data
searchable from a single interface.

81
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:50,855
OAI-PMH submits one of
seven HTTP requests which

82
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:57,390
returns an XML metadata file
with the requests records.

83
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,510
The success of this is very much
dependent upon good metadata.

84
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,761
To review, good metadata is standardized,
consistent and interoperable,

85
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:13,174
and facilitates discovery,
preservation and archiving of data.

86
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:18,809
