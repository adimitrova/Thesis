2
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:10,294
In this module we will be conveying
the essential aspects of archiving

3
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:11,260
digital data.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,830
It's important that we cover
the topic in detail because simply

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,590
storing data on a CD, or even in the
cloud, is not the same as archiving data.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,940
To ensure that data are accessible and
usable over the long-term,

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,290
data requires specific strategies
to preserve their authenticity and

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,240
integrity, something a trustworthy
repository can provide.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,060
At the end of this lesson, you will be
able to understand the preservation needs

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,290
of research data, distinguish
between concepts of authenticity and

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,400
integrity, and recognize
the different types of metadata and

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,940
their roles in data discovery and reuse.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,380
Preservation of digital data is
especially important because data

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,780
is a valuable resource and
can be at risk if not properly preserved.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,680
A key aspect of both
successfully managing and

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,890
sharing data is ensuring the data
will be available for future use.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,520
However, data present real challenges for
several reasons

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,640
due to the nature of digital objects and
the heterogeneity of data.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,030
Some of the major risks associated with
losing digital data include benign

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,440
neglect, bit rot, obsolescence,
and insufficient documentation.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,090
Data loss due to benign
neglect is the result of not

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,490
having an active strategy in place for
long-term preservation.

23
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,960
Without an active preservation strategy,
there are no guarantees that your data

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,490
will be usable years later,
or when others need it.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,100
The ability to use data in digital form
is contingent upon layers of technology,

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,450
to access, read, and render the data
from physical storage media.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,810
Without you knowing it,
data over time are subject to degradation.

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,760
This brings us to bit rot.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,380
Digital data are represented as bits, or
units of machine-readable information.

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,210
These bits may degrade or become corrupted
over time, which we refer to as bit rot.

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,260
This perceived rot may cause decreased,
delayed, or faulty rendering of the data.

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,710
In addition, the physical media
on which the data are stored,

33
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,590
may also gradually decay.

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,450
Even if the data or the physical
storage media have not experienced any

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,960
deterioration, there is still a risk
to data loss due to obsolescence.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,280
With perpetual advancements in technology,
software and

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,790
hardware eventually become
obsolete as time progresses.

38
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,790
Consider the researcher who has his or
her research saved on a 5.5" floppy disk.

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,020
Because this storage medium
is rarely supported today,

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,890
if at all, the data could be lost,
effectively trapped on a floppy disk.

41
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,910
Likewise, if she saved these data
in a proprietary file format,

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,110
then the software company that developed
it decided to discontinue its support for

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,570
that file format,
her data may have become unreadable.

44
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,790
An act of preservation strategy would
include approaches to avoid obsolescence,

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:35,280
such as constant monitoring of changes
in technology, migration of files

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,380
to current formats, and normalization
of files to non-proprietary formats.

47
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,320
Still, if the data are sound and
the technology is current, there is yet

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,830
another potential cause of data loss.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,180
Insufficient documentation presents
a risk to long-term data preservation.

50
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,830
A lack of complete and
appropriate documentation and

51
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,180
metadata can make it impossible to
interpret the data in the future.

52
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:10,210
Without a codebook,
that contains variable and value labels,

53
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,810
we're left with data that are essentially
meaningless and unusable.

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,753
The addition of questionnaires,
methodology reports,

55
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:25,740
codebooks, and descriptive metadata,
alongside the data,

56
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,498
are essential for ensuring the data
continue to be useful in the future.
