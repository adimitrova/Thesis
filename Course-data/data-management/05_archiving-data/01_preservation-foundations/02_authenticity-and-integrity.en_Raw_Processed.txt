primary goal preservation is 
to safeguard authenticity

defined society 
american archivists, authenticity is 
quality genuine, 
a counterfeit, free tampering, 
is typically inferred 
internal external evidence 
including physical characteristics, 
structure, content, 
context, digital data so 
vulnerable to change, 
whether inadvertent not, ensuring 
authenticity particular 
data set is especially important 
this is much related to 
issue trust, particularly 
data that will shared purposes 
replication secondary analysis 
users data must guarantees 
that data 
tampered represent actual 
data generated data producer 
if data altered in way 
documentation detailing alteration 
maintained 
made available alongside data 
establishing authenticity 
digital data involves processes 
undertaken researcher 
data repository 
uk data archives website provides 
a useful list best practices to 
assist researchers in maintaining 
authenticity data files 
best practices include maintaining 
a single master file data 
assigning responsibility master 
files to a single project team member 
regulating write access to master 
versions data files 
recording changes to master files 
maintaining master files in case 
subsequent versions contain errors 
archiving copies master 
files regular intervals 
developing a formal procedure 
destruction master files 
you see, this list focuses 
lessening potential unwanted 
unintended changes to a file 
writeaccess controls 
this list also points to 
importance keeping careful 
documentation in relation to 
changes made to master data file 
formal procedures 
clear roles responsibilities in place 
will help researchers maintain 
an authentic final copy data, 
free unintentional 
unwanted changes 
likewise, repositories procedures

maintain authenticity 
data house safekeeping 
establishing authenticity data 
submissions requires repository 
to collect preserve descriptive 
contextual metadata to allow 
appropriate identification 
interpretation data 
repository must also document 
operations performed data, 
including automatic 
manual manipulation data files 
content 
validation mechanisms 
in place to ensure transformed 
modified data file versions 
representative original 
actions necessary 
to provide users a degree 
trust in authenticity data 
data that properly preserved 
quality authentic, 
also integrity 
integrity means that a digital 
object corrupted time 
in transit between storage locations 
systems 
clifford lynch, director 
coalition networked information puts 
it, integrity is knowing certainty 
that we in hand 
set sequences bits that came 
existence object created 
like authenticity, 
there best practices 
that researchers 
information professionals perform to 
attend to integrity digital data 
include backing critical 
frequently used files using 
an automated backup process 
storing master files in 
open source formats 
longterm software readability 
verifying backup copies 
files original files 
comparing checksum values, 
file size, date 
storing copies files two 
different types storage media 
copying migrating files to 
new storage media every two to five 
years to avoid effects physical 
degradation storage media 
simple tasks assist 
in avoiding corruption 
digital files time 
redundancy migration 
in addition, verification 
files checksums is 
an important mechanism 
data repositories to use to ensure 
data files modified 
in transit to repository 
we will discuss tasks in 
detail,while technology 
increased ability to invent 
new ways collecting 
analyzing data, 
also inherent vulnerabilities
