2
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:11,642
The primary goal of preservation is
to safeguard the authenticity and

3
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,254
the integrity of digital content.

4
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:18,390
We want to be sure that the data
are what we expect them to be.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,890
As defined by the Society of
American Archivists, authenticity is

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,050
the quality of being genuine, not
a counterfeit, and free from tampering,

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,350
and is typically inferred from
internal and external evidence.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,580
Including it's physical characteristics,
structure, content,

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,780
and context, because digital data are so

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,250
vulnerable to change,
whether inadvertent or not, ensuring

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,010
the authenticity of any particular
data set is especially important.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,000
This is very much related to
the issue of trust, particularly for

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,230
data that will be shared for purposes
of replication or secondary analysis.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,050
Users of the data must have guarantees
that the data have not been

15
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:14,080
tampered with and represent the actual
data generated by the data producer.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,602
If data have been altered in any way
documentation detailing the alteration

17
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:24,099
should be maintained and
made available alongside the data.

18
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,607
Establishing authenticity of
digital data involves processes

19
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:32,870
undertaken both by the researcher and
the data repository.

20
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,742
The UK Data Archives website provides
a useful list of best practices to

21
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:42,869
assist researchers in maintaining
the authenticity of their data files.

22
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,486
These best practices include maintaining
a single master file of the data.

23
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:54,182
Assigning responsibility for master
files to a single project team member.

24
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:59,229
Regulating write access to master
versions of the data files.

25
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,300
Recording all changes to master files.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,189
Maintaining all master files in case
subsequent versions contain errors.

27
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,593
Archiving copies of master
files at regular intervals.

28
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:16,473
And developing a formal procedure for
the destruction of master files.

29
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:22,301
As you can see, this list focuses on
lessening the potential for unwanted or

30
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:27,231
unintended changes to a file
through write-access controls.

31
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:31,370
This list also points to
the importance of keeping careful

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,449
documentation in relation to any
changes made to the master data file.

33
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,440
Having these formal procedures and
clear roles and responsibilities in place

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,975
will help researchers maintain
an authentic final copy of their data,

35
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,936
free of unintentional and
unwanted changes.

36
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:53,841
Likewise, repositories have procedures and
processes in place to

37
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:58,753
maintain the authenticity of
the data they house for safekeeping.

38
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:03,598
Establishing authenticity of data
submissions requires the repository

39
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,442
to collect and preserve descriptive and
contextual metadata to allow for

40
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:12,597
appropriate identification and
interpretation of the data.

41
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:18,562
The repository must also document any
operations performed on the data,

42
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:20,774
including any automatic or

43
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:25,215
manual manipulation of data files and
their content.

44
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:29,546
Validation mechanisms should be
in place to ensure transformed or

45
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:33,890
modified data file versions
are representative of the original.

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,679
All of these actions are necessary
to provide users with a degree of

47
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,510
trust in the authenticity of the data.

48
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,340
Data that are properly preserved not only
have the quality of being authentic, but

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,937
they also have integrity.

50
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:53,243
Having integrity means that a digital
object has not been corrupted over time or

51
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:56,660
in transit between storage locations or
systems.

52
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,290
As Clifford Lynch, Director of the
Coalition for Networked Information puts

53
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,340
it, integrity is knowing with certainty
that we have in hand the same

54
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,180
set of sequences of bits that came into
existence when the object was created.

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,240
Just like with authenticity,

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
there are some best practices
that both researchers and

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,430
information professionals can perform to
attend to the integrity of digital data.

58
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,797
These include backing up critical or

59
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,622
frequently used files using
an automated backup process.

60
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:35,862
Storing master files in
open source formats for

61
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:39,151
long-term software readability.

62
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:44,029
Verifying backup copies of
files against original files by

63
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,329
comparing checksum values,
file size, and date.

64
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,884
Storing copies of files on two
different types of storage media.

65
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:57,672
And copying or migrating files to
new storage media every two to five

66
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:02,634
years to avoid the effects of physical
degradation of storage media.

67
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,966
These simple tasks can assist
in avoiding corruption

68
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:09,899
of digital files over time
through redundancy and migration.

69
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,748
In addition, the verification
of files through checksums is

70
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:19,599
an important mechanism for
data repositories to use to ensure

71
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:24,926
the data files have not been modified
in transit to the repository.

72
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:29,917
We will discuss these tasks in
more detail,while technology has

73
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:34,362
increased our ability to invent
new ways of collecting and

74
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:38,819
analyzing data,
it also has inherent vulnerabilities.

75
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,478
Authenticity and the integrity of
data can be achieved only through

76
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,558
an active preservation strategy based
on standards and best practices.
