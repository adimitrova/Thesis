time to discuss a 
important topic that is near 
dear to hearts 
minds information professionals 
metadata, you learned in 
a previous module metadata 
is often defined data data 
specifically accurately, 
metadata refers to structured information 
that describes, explains, locates 
otherwise represents something else 
metadata, is preserved along side 
data makes possible to retrieve, 
use manage an information resource 
metadata is necessary 
resource discovery, organization 
electronic resources, 
interoperability across systems, 
digital identification data 
archiving preserving data 
metadata comes in three forms 
descriptive, administrative 
structural 
descriptive metadata describes a work 
purposes discovery 
identification 
descriptive metadata includes information 
title, author abstract 
this is type information 
that makes possible 
to find data youre looking 
to verify that youve 
found is indeed you need 
dublin core metadata element set 
is often considered core metadata 
simple concise resource description 
administrative metadata is structured 
information regarding management 
tracking data a period time 
may tell us file type, 
file created 
permitted to access 
use data file 
administrative metadata 
one two types, 
rights management 
preservation metadata 
rights management metadata deals 
intellectual property rights 
preservation metadata records information 
necessary to properly archive 
preserve digital materials 
premis, stands preservation 
metadata implementation strategies, 
is a widely adopted metadata standard 
that includes rights management 
preservation metadata 
premis defines in data dictionary 
repository know 
intellectual entities, 
objects, agents, events 
rights associated 
preservation landscape 
structural metadata describes physical 
logical structure digital objects 
data, structural metadata 
indicates data elements 
assembled a single data set 
instance, a typical data set 
a set variables values 
a set observations, structural 
metadata allows us to understand 
pieces packaged 
within dataset 
data documentation initiative ddi, 
metadata specification, 
includes structural metadata elements 
that allow us to describe social 
science data variable level 
elements include variable 
identification, value categories 
location variables 
within larger data set 
many metadata standards also 
specify formatting conventions 
control vocabularies metadata entries 
you ever tried to find 
something in a database 
information resource 
you performed a search, 
query returned results, 
even though you knew 
sure information in there 
happens time 
bad metadata likely to blame 
good metadata based metadata 
standards, often require 
adherence to specific representation 
rules controlled vocabularies 
representation rules dictate 
character formatting 
to ensure consistency in data entry 
example data sites 
representation rules requires that 
in creator name element name 
entered family name first 
given name 
john smith entered smith, 
john 
controlled vocabularies prescribe 
an authoritative list terms to 
used to express values 
metadata elements 
ddis controlled vocabulary provides 
a list terms to used in 
ddi metadata elements 
time formal entity whether 
in association, business, 
political party school 
referred to organization 
in ddi analysis unit element 
good standardized meta data also allows 
multiple systems different hardware 
software platforms 
data structures 
interfaces to exchange data a minimal 
loss content functionality 
open archive initiative protocol 
metadata harvesting, oaipmh, 
demonstrates standardized metadata 
shared across distributed systems 
oaipmh is a low entry 
interoperability framework that 
facilitates efficient 
dissemination digital materials 
allows one system to grab 
harvest metadata multiple 
repositories to make data 
searchable a single interface 
oaipmh submits one 
seven http requests 
returns an xml metadata file 
requests records 
success this is much 
dependent upon good metadata 
to review, good metadata is standardized, 
consistent interoperable, 
facilitates discovery, 
preservation archiving data
