music 
in this module we will conveying 
essential aspects archiving 
digital data 
important that we cover 
topic in detail simply 
storing data a cd, even in 
cloud, is archiving data 
to ensure that data accessible 
usable longterm, 
data requires specific strategies 
to preserve authenticity 
integrity, something a trustworthy 
repository provide 
end this lesson, you will 
able to understand preservation needs 
research data, distinguish 
between concepts authenticity 
integrity, recognize 
different types metadata 
roles in data discovery reuse 
preservation digital data is 
especially important data 
is a valuable resource 
risk if properly preserved 
a key aspect 
successfully managing 
sharing data is ensuring data 
will available future use 
however, data present real challenges 
several reasons 
due to nature digital objects 
heterogeneity data 
major risks associated 
losing digital data include benign 
neglect, bit rot, obsolescence, 
insufficient documentation 
data loss due to benign 
neglect is result 
an active strategy in place 
longterm preservation 
without an active preservation strategy, 
there guarantees that data 
will usable years later, 
others need 
ability to use data in digital form 
is contingent upon layers technology, 
to access, read, render data 
physical storage media 
without you knowing it, 
data time subject to degradation 
this brings us to bit rot 
digital data represented bits, 
units machinereadable information 
bits may degrade become corrupted 
time, we refer to bit rot 
this perceived rot may cause decreased, 
delayed, faulty rendering data 
in addition, physical media 
data stored, 
may also gradually decay 
even if data physical 
storage media experienced 
deterioration, there is still a risk 
to data loss due to obsolescence 
perpetual advancements in technology, 
software 
hardware eventually become 
obsolete time progresses 
consider researcher 
research saved a floppy disk 
this storage medium 
is rarely supported today, 
if all, data could lost, 
effectively trapped a floppy disk 
likewise, if saved data 
in a proprietary file format, 
software company that developed 
decided to discontinue support 
that file format, 
data may become unreadable 
an act preservation strategy would 
include approaches to avoid obsolescence, 
constant monitoring changes 
in technology, migration files 
to current formats, normalization 
files to nonproprietary formats 
still, if data sound 
technology is current, there is yet 
another potential cause data loss 
insufficient documentation presents 
a risk to longterm data preservation 
a lack complete 
appropriate documentation 
metadata make impossible to 
interpret data in future 
without a codebook, 
that contains variable value labels, 
left data that essentially 
meaningless unusable 
addition questionnaires, 
methodology reports, 
codebooks, descriptive metadata, 
alongside data, 
essential ensuring data 
continue to useful in future
