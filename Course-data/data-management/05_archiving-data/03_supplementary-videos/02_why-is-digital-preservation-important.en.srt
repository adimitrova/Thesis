2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:08,608
Digital preservation is important
because it's not immediately obvious to

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,110
most people.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,760
Researchers are busy with focus
on the research they're doing and

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,380
the important content of what they're
studying and it's up to people like me,

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,795
like data librarians, to remind them
to keep the data safe in the long term.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,720
And also by doing that they're making it
available to themselves in the future.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,300
Because, although it's very
known to you at this point,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,910
you'll forget the details
about it in the future.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,570
So you need to do the documentation and
everything to be able to share it and

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,360
also for your own self.

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,490
>> I think digital preservation
is very important.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,600
I come from the scientific world,
and in the scientific world

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,678
researchers build on the results
that were published by others.

15
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:03,370
So, keeping these data is paramount
because if you don't take care of

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,740
the adequate digital preservation of
the data, there is no possibility for

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,350
later researchers to reuse these data and
to build on these results.

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,480
But it's not only important for academia.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,820
Also outside of academia these
research data can be used.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,390
So digital preservation should be
at the top of all of our lists.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,060
>> Well digital preservation
is important because,

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,030
most of the output of research from
the academy is now digital and

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,120
there isn't an analog form of that,
in many cases.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,840
So preserving that output serves
the same function as libraries and

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,140
archives have in the past.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,060
If we don't preserve this digital
information it's really in danger

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,740
of being lost.

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,700
And that's a loss to the entire community.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,570
And that creates a situation where
research cannot be validated, or

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,220
can be reproduced.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,165
And that's a serious problem for
the entire academic endeavor.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,670
>> Digital preservation as an extension
of preservation of anything else

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,530
is important because it allows us
to take resources which inspire and

34
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,600
inform to be transmitted
through time to those who,

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,710
in the future,
who'll want to better understand and

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,840
learn what has meaning to those
who have gone before them.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,050
So preservation is important to do this,
both for our analog materials, but

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,980
also for our digital.

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,590
Which inherently, we cannot discern
without that proactive effort to preserve.

40
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,160
>> Digital preservation
is important because

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,810
it helps to unleash the value
in digital objects.

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,510
We create a lot of digital content
every day and some of it we save or

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,469
set aside for preservation purposes.

44
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,880
That value remains a potential,

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,690
like a latent value in these objects and
we release when we use the objects again.

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,550
In order to be able to use those objects,

47
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,870
we need to be able to
preserve them in between.

48
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,230
So preservation is a stage
in the value chain

49
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,470
that takes the value of
objects through time.

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,060
>> Digital preservation is important
because it allows us to capture

51
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,900
the knowledge needed to apply and recreate
the data sets that are being archived.

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,040
This in turn allows us to
manage reproducible research.

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,650
Where a second researcher can
reproduce the results of the original

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,800
researcher using the same data sets and
the same analysis mechanism.

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,640
So preservation is the mechanism by
which we capture the knowledge required

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,405
to do that.

57
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,990
>> It's important because our cultural
heritage is being saved in digital formats

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,110
now and it used to be that history was
saved by what didn't get thrown away.

59
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,599
And that's not a strategy that works
anymore because if we leave our digital

60
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,570
stuff just on the ground in the hopes
that it will manage to live for

61
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,906
100 years, it won't.

62
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:20,316
>> I think libraries which are drawn
into digital preservation for

63
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:25,725
whatever reason, I think,
into a great social service because

64
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:32,852
they are making the really available data,
information for scholastic research.

65
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:38,332
So this is another actually
helping the society to evolve and

66
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:43,275
also grow from the idea of
scholarly information which

67
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:47,155
otherwise would not have been available.

68
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:56,979
