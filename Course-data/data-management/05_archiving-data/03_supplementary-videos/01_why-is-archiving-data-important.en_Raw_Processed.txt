you know even though i dont think that 
many researchers think preservation 
first thing laugh 
think designing a study 
if you think of, well that even 
yourself, if you think, 
i want to able to find reuse 
that data a few years 
thats already a good goal to 
laugh put 
right things 
research process would allow to, 
while making available 
yourself, also others 
value preservation 
rises time 
in real time, people feel like, 
oh we dont really need to preservation 
i want to make available 
im interested in access 
if youre interested in long term access, 
investment in producing well 
formed packages pays 
time you 
go back to archival package 
represent in kind 
technology that comes 
longterm access to stuff is 
providing longterm access, 
providing preservation 
thats communicating future 
music 
thats essentially is 
able to communicate 
people gone 
i think that scholarly record, 
that scientific evidence base, 
is an important 
enough thing that future 
will want to know 
important to part 
process if people near want 
information, records, data that 
get it, that we part that 
we well, 
we better we could before, 
we incorporate technologies 
better 
making things 
accessible to whoever is interested 
i think that part that to 
with, we get open access data, 
means that necessarily a 
focused, constrained set researchers 
anybody wants to 
know that thing 
i really like notion open 
access to anyone whos interested in 
well, archiving data is 
core sharing data effectively 
places data in a central 
repository researchers 
world gain access to 
provides a legacy to that data 
software changes technologies change 
archives preserve data 
make accessible beyond 
changes in technology, 
is really provides a much robust 
way sharing data recording 
documenting is we we 
advance scientific communities 

so, archivings absolutely essential 
a living, 
breathing way to make scientific 
enterprise open to everyone wants to 
participate in scientific enterprise 
if items that in digital 
form will needed in future, 
to start managing integrity 
you trust desk drive, 
you trust vendor 
eventually, this technology will 
either fail become obsolete 
so you need a way to migrate 
data prior type storage 
to next cheaper type storage 
thats coming in future 
i teach students in 
epidemiology courses, cause ill 
a session data management part 
that is you going to archive data 
i tell war stories 
national data collection in 
australia that archived five 
a quarter inch floppy disks 
now, ill leave to you to explain 
to audience a five 
a quarter inch floppy disk is 
i expect people 
might watch this video would 
idea im talking 
a magnetic medium that you 
would to feed a drive, 
an old desktop computer 
would a whirring machine 
that would read this disc 
you cannot find devices to 
read discs anymore 
that repository 
a national data collection oral health 
ive spoken to colleagues 
magnetic tapes that to scraped 
got oxidized 
would scrape tapes 
i saw bits metal coming it, 
magnetic stuff coming a tape 
that hopefully oxidization, 
data, right, 
that is scraping tape 
so, good people you 
work realize that in 
certainly in years now, certainly 
in years to now, people will 
equivalent scraping data clouds 
that we regard permanent 
fun to work people 
like that that vision, 
creating something 
future, 
realize future is 
a thumb drive a cloud
