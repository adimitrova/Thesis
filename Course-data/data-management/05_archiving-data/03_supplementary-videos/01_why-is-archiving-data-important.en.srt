[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:12,039
You know even though I don't think that
many researchers think of preservation

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,150
as the first thing [LAUGH] when
they think of designing a study.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,130
But if you think of, well that even for
yourself, if you think,

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,350
I want to be able to find and reuse
that data after a few years from now.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,920
That's already a good goal to
[LAUGH] put into yourself.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,720
And by doing the right things during
your research process would allow to,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,540
not only while making it available for
yourself, but also for others.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,740
>> The value of preservation
rises over time.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,630
In real time, people feel like,

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,400
oh we don't really need to do preservation
because I only want to make it available.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,990
I'm only interested in access.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,030
If you're interested in long term access,

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,870
the investment in producing these well
formed packages pays off again and

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,545
again and again over time because you
can go back to the archival package and

16
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:05,175
re-present it in any kind of
technology that comes up.

17
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:09,190
>> Long-term access to stuff is

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,900
providing long-term access,
providing preservation.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,926
That's communicating with the future.

20
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:16,795
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,990
That's essentially what it is.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,923
It's being able to communicate
with people after we're gone.

23
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:27,706
And I think that the scholarly record,

24
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:32,752
that the scientific evidence base,
is an important

25
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:38,040
enough thing that the future
will want to know about it.

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,650
>> It's very important to be part of
the process where if people near want

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,520
information, records, data that they can
get it, and that we can be part of that.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,740
We can do it well,
we can do it better than we could before,

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,030
we can incorporate technologies
into doing it better.

30
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,520
And making things more and
more accessible to whoever is interested.

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,650
And I think that part of that has to do
with, as we get into open access data,

32
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:08,780
it means that it's not necessarily a very
focused, constrained set of researchers.

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,120
It's anybody who wants to
know more about that thing.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,290
And I really like the notion of open
access to anyone who's interested in it.

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,060
>> Well, archiving data is at
the core of sharing data effectively.

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,200
It places the data in a central
repository where researchers all over

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,860
the world can gain access to it.

38
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,970
It provides a legacy to that data as
software changes or technologies change.

39
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,960
Archives can preserve data and

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,950
make it accessible beyond
those changes in technology,

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,870
is really provides a much more robust
way of sharing data and recording and

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,140
documenting what it is we do as we
advance our scientific communities.

43
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,870
These.

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,530
So, archiving's absolutely essential.

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,870
It's a living,
breathing way to make the scientific

46
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,850
enterprise open to everyone who wants to
participate in the scientific enterprise.

47
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,740
>> If any of the items that are in digital
form will be needed in the future,

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,910
they have to start managing integrity.

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,780
You can not trust any desk drive,
you can not trust any vendor.

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,880
Eventually, this technology will
either fail or become obsolete.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,910
So you need a way to migrate your
data from the prior type of storage

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,570
to the next cheaper type of storage
that's coming in the future.

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,620
>> I teach students in just my
epidemiology courses, cause I'll

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,970
have a session on data management and part
of that is were you going to archive data.

55
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,720
And I tell war stories from
national data collection in

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,590
Australia that was archived on five and
a quarter inch floppy disks.

57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,130
Now, I'll leave it to you to explain
to the audience what a five and

58
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,420
a quarter inch floppy disk is
because I expect most people

59
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,230
who might watch this video would
have no idea what I'm talking about.

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,770
But it's a magnetic medium that you
would have to feed into a drive,

61
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,410
into an old desktop computer.

62
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,680
And it would have a whirring machine
that would read this disc and

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,780
you cannot find devices to
read those discs anymore.

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,840
And that the was the repository for
a national data collection of oral health.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,110
And I've spoken to colleagues who have
magnetic tapes that had to be scraped

66
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,630
because they got oxidized.

67
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,030
And they would scrape the tapes and
I saw bits of metal coming off it,

68
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,690
some magnetic stuff coming of a tape
that hopefully it's oxidization,

69
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,180
not data, right, but
that is scraping tape.

70
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,530
So, the good people you
work with realize that in

71
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,470
certainly in 20 years now, and certainly
in 50 years to now, people will be doing

72
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,650
the equivalent of scraping data clouds
that we now regard as being permanent.

73
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,163
And it's fun to work with people
like that who have that vision,

74
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:18,260
because they are creating something for
they future, and

75
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,873
they realize the future is more
than just a thumb drive or a cloud.

76
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:29,099
