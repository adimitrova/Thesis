digital preservation is important 
immediately obvious to 
people 
researchers busy focus 
research theyre 
important content theyre 
studying to people like me, 
like data librarians, to remind 
to keep data safe in long term 
also that theyre making 
available to in future 
because, although 
known to you this point, 
youll forget details 
in future 
so you need to documentation 
everything to able to share 
also self 
i think digital preservation 
is important 
i come scientific world, 
in scientific world 
researchers build results 
that published others 
so, keeping data is paramount 
if you dont take care 
adequate digital preservation 
data, there is possibility 
later researchers to reuse data 
to build results 
important academia 
also outside academia 
research data used 
so digital preservation 
top lists 
well digital preservation 
is important because, 
output research 
academy is digital 
there isnt an analog form that, 
in many cases 
so preserving that output serves 
function libraries 
archives in past 
if we dont preserve this digital 
information really in danger 
lost 
thats a loss to entire community 
that creates a situation 
research cannot validated, 
reproduced 
thats a serious problem 
entire academic endeavor 
digital preservation an extension 
preservation anything else 
is important allows us 
to take resources inspire 
inform to transmitted 
time to who, 
in future, 
wholl want to better understand 
learn meaning to 
gone 
so preservation is important to this, 
analog materials, 
also digital 
inherently, we cannot discern 
without that proactive effort to preserve 
digital preservation 
is important 
helps to unleash value 
in digital objects 
we create a lot digital content 
every day we save 
set aside preservation purposes 
that value remains a potential, 
like a latent value in objects 
we release we use objects 
in order to able to use objects, 
we need to able to 
preserve in between 
so preservation is a stage 
in value chain 
that takes value 
objects time 
digital preservation is important 
allows us to capture 
knowledge needed to apply recreate 
data sets that archived 
this in turn allows us to 
manage reproducible research 
a second researcher 
reproduce results original 
researcher using data sets 
analysis mechanism 
so preservation is mechanism 
we capture knowledge required 
to that 
important cultural 
heritage is saved in digital formats 
used to that history 
saved didnt get thrown away 
thats a strategy that works 
anymore if we leave digital 
stuff ground in hopes 
that will manage to live 
years, wont 
i think libraries drawn 
digital preservation 
whatever reason, i think, 
a great social service 
making really available data, 
information scholastic research 
so this is another actually 
helping society to evolve 
also grow idea 
scholarly information 
otherwise would available
