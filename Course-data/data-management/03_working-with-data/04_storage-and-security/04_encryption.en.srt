1
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:16,545
We recommended that you encrypt your
data a few times in the last section, so

2
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:18,600
what do we mean by data encryption?

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,420
Encryption is the process of converting
your data into an unreadable code.

4
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,600
A user would need the encryption key or
secure password in order to read the file.

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,110
Encryption will protect
your data from disclosure,

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,390
in the case that your laptop or
storage device is lost or stolen.

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,030
The University of Edinburgh Data
Encryption Policy, warns that medium or

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,420
high risk personal data or

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,020
business information must be encrypted
if it leaves the University environment.

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,270
Encryption is reliant on
the creation of a strong password.

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,870
The data can't be recovered if
this encryption key is lost.

12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,900
So you should establish a reliable and

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,090
secure backup procedure for
the data and any associated passwords.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,730
Encryption is an obvious step for

15
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,820
laptop security, however there's
no one size fits all solution.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,060
BitLocker, Pretty Good Privacy.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,250
And other commercial software
packages are available, but

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,880
you'll need to consider
your operating system.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,480
If you keep sensitive
data on USB flash drives,

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,380
it's recommended that you use
drives with encryption software.

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,240
These give protection to
the data if the drive is lost.

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,670
Especially if the data contained personal
or commercially sensitive information.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,675
Compared with ordinary USB flash drives,
they only cost a modest amount more, so

24
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,575
are a good buy.

25
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:50,055
Your local IT support service should be
happy to advise on the suitability of any

26
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:53,055
encrypted flash drive that
you plan on purchasing.

27
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:57,055
So what happens to sensitive data
when it's no longer required?

28
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,995
You may have anonymized your data and

29
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,560
now want to dispose of
the identifiable portions, or

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,890
you may have agreed to delete your data
at the end of your research project.

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,810
File deletion is not enough to completely
remove sensitive data from your computer,

32
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,750
it only removes the pointers to the disk
sectors in which the data reside.

33
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,899
The deleted files can be easily recovered
with commonly available software.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,320
So let's take a look at how you can
permanently remove sensitive data.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,940
There are three main options available.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,900
Data erasure, also known as data clearing
or data wiping, uses special software

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,990
to remove all data, while leaving the hard
drive or storage medium still operable.

38
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,000
However, you should be aware that
current techniques may not be completely

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,300
successful on solid-state drives and
USB flash drives.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,150
Degaussing is another way to remove data,

41
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,670
it disturbs the alignment
of magnetic storage media.

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,920
But in many cases, it makes new media
such as hard drives and tapes unusable.

43
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,050
Physical destruction through shredding,
pulverising or

44
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,990
incineration is also an option.

45
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,160
You've now completed this module.

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,481
If you take a look at the further reading
on the next slide, you'll get additional

47
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:23,255
references and resources, so you can learn
more about storage, backup, and security.
