1
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:14,890
So what would happen if
you lost all of your data?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,880
Have you ever considered
that it might happen to you?

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,080
This module will introduce you to the
issues involved in storing, securing and

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,330
backing up your research data.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,800
By the end, you'll be aware of the
different storage options available to you

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,990
and will understand the importance of
data backup, security and encryption.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,510
At the very least, you'll be motivated
to avoid your own data loss scenario.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,230
According to a survey released in 2014 by
Kroll Ontrack, a provider of data recovery

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,270
and e-discovery products and services,
hard disk drive crashes have more than

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,760
doubled in the last four years, making
them the most common cause of data loss.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,155
When they surveyed over 1,000 customers
about the most common causes of data loss,

12
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:06,933
66% cited hard crash failure,
compared to 29% in 2010.

13
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,270
This is followed by 14%
claiming human error.

14
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,252
Software failure ranked as the third most
common cause of data loss with just 6%.

15
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:19,270
Your data are the lifeblood
of your research.

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,560
If you lose your data, recovery may
be slow, costly, or worse still,

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,730
it may not even be possible.

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,162
This is why it's so important to store and
back up your data securely.

19
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:33,602
It's useful to think about how much
storage you'll require and plan for

20
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:34,998
that from the outset.

21
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:37,670
Also think about who will
need access to your data and

22
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,410
what that means in terms of
where it should be stored.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,490
By considering these issues at the outset,
you can plan for them appropriately, and

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,509
also include data management
costs in your grant applications.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,880
So where can you store your data securely
during the course of your research?

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,810
There are various options such as
network drives, PCs and laptops, or

27
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,800
external devices.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,720
Let's take a look at the pros and
cons of each of these.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,230
Network drives are managed
by staff centrally or

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,330
those within your school,
department, or college.

31
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,160
It's highly recommended that you
store your data to network drives.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,160
This means that there's
a single copy of your data,

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,082
that you can access it whenever you need
to, and that it's backed up regularly.

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,880
Most importantly,
it means that your data are held securely,

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,400
minimizing the risk of loss,
damage, or unauthorized use.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,700
You can of course use PCs, laptops,
and other external storage devices,

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,610
such as hard drives,
USB sticks, CDs, and DVDs.

38
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,640
These can be a convenient option due
to their low cost and portability.

39
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,800
However, they should never be used for
the master copy of your data.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,710
Laptops and PCs can be lost and stolen.

41
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,870
And CDs, DVDs and
magnetic tapes all degrade over time.

42
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,185
Errors writing to CDs and
DVDs are fairly common.

43
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:04,540
And obviously, these can be lost,
misplaced, or damaged.

44
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,500
If you choose to use CDs, DVDs or
memory sticks, pick high quality

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,360
products from good manufacturers and
follow the care instructions provided.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,540
Regularly check the media to make
sure they're not failing and

47
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,890
periodically refresh them.

48
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,565
Refreshing means to copy your
files from one disk to another.
