we recommended that you encrypt 
data a few times in last section, so 
we mean data encryption 
encryption is process converting 
data an unreadable code 
a user would need encryption key 
secure password in order to read file 
encryption will protect 
data disclosure, 
in case that laptop 
storage device is lost stolen 
university edinburgh data 
encryption policy, warns that medium 
high risk personal data 
business information must encrypted 
if leaves university environment 
encryption is reliant 
creation a strong password 
data cant recovered if 
this encryption key is lost 
so you establish a reliable 
secure backup procedure 
data associated passwords 
encryption is an obvious step 
laptop security, however theres 
one size fits solution 
bitlocker, pretty good privacy 
commercial software 
packages available, 
youll need to consider 
operating system 
if you keep sensitive 
data usb flash drives, 
recommended that you use 
drives encryption software 
give protection to 
data if drive is lost 
especially if data contained personal 
commercially sensitive information 
compared ordinary usb flash drives, 
cost a modest amount more, so 
a good buy 
local support service 
happy to advise suitability 
encrypted flash drive that 
you plan purchasing 
so happens to sensitive data 
longer required 
you may anonymized data 
want to dispose 
identifiable portions, 
you may agreed to delete data 
end research project 
file deletion is enough to completely 
remove sensitive data computer, 
removes pointers to disk 
sectors in data reside 
deleted files easily recovered 
commonly available software 
so lets take a look you 
permanently remove sensitive data 
there three main options available 
data erasure, also known data clearing 
data wiping, uses special software 
to remove data, while leaving hard 
drive storage medium still operable 
however, you aware that 
current techniques may completely 
successful solidstate drives 
usb flash drives 
degaussing is another way to remove data, 
disturbs alignment 
magnetic storage media 
in many cases, makes new media 
hard drives tapes unusable 
physical destruction shredding, 
pulverising 
incineration is also an option 
youve completed this module 
if you take a look reading 
next slide, youll get additional 
references resources, so you learn 
storage, backup, security
