in addition to storing data securely, 
you also make sure 
that you backup regularly 
keeping backups is probably single 
important data management task 
theres a real risk loss hard 
drive failure accidental deletion 
basic principle backup 
is that you three copies 
files least two 
different media one offsite 
you also test backups 
regularly to make sure that you could 
restore if needed 
theres a long list questions 
you ask considering 
backup strategy 
will you back data 
regularly will backups made 
will data backed up, 
that changed 
a backup changed data is 
known an incremental backup 
while a backup data 
is known a full backup 
often will full 
incremental backups made 
long will backups stored 
much drive space 
many cds dvds will required 
to maintain this backup schedule 
you keep track 
different versions data, 
especially backing 
to multiple devices 
you understand you 
require in terms backup, 
check services available 
to meet needs 
also important to ascertain 
backup schedule 
retention policies centralized 
backup services you may use 
example, grandfather, 
father, son, rotation scheme, files may 
available two to three months 
storage space is overwritten 
there various cloud services that 
you use to backup data 
typically allow you to store 
synchronize files online 
between computers 
offer a limited amount space 
free will charge you 
additional storage premium services 
common service providers dropbox, 
google drive onedrive 
you take a look wikipedia, 
a comparison 
there obvious advantages 
to using cloud services backup 
user intervention is required, so you 
dont need to change tapes, label cds 
perform manual tasks 
provide a remote offsite backup copy 
provide encryption versioning, 
theyre multiplatform 
there are, however, 
significant risks to using cloud services 
providers may store data outside 
european economic area, so 
you may in breach 
european data protection directive, 
research funders policy 
restoration data may 
slow depending bandwidth 
stored data may entirely 
private if unencrypted, 
service provider 
may go business
