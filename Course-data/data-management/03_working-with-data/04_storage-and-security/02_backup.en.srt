1
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:14,468
In addition to storing your data securely,

2
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:17,270
you should also make sure
that you backup regularly.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,790
Keeping backups is probably the single
most important data management task.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,321
There's a real risk of loss through hard
drive failure or accidental deletion.

5
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:32,721
The basic 3-2-1 principle of backup
is that you have three copies

6
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,585
of your files on at least two
different media with one offsite.

7
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:41,203
You should also test your backups
regularly to make sure that you could

8
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:42,750
restore from them if needed.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,650
There's a long list of questions
you should ask when considering

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,720
your backup strategy.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,550
How will you back up your data?

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,440
How regularly will backups be made?

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,750
Will all the data be backed up, or
just that which has been changed?

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,130
A backup of changed data is
known as an incremental backup.

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,610
While a backup of all data
is known as a full backup.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,530
How often will full and
incremental backups be made?

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,499
How long will your backups be stored?

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,270
How much drive space or

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,250
how many CDs or DVDs will be required
to maintain this backup schedule?

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,080
And how can you keep track of
different versions of data,

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,730
especially when backing
up to multiple devices?

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,110
Once you understand what you
require in terms of backup,

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,849
check what services are available
to meet these needs.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,970
It's also important to ascertain
the backup schedule and

25
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,390
retention policies of any centralized
backup services you may use.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,670
For example, under the grandfather,
father, son, rotation scheme, files may

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,740
only be available for two to three months
before the storage space is overwritten.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,790
There are various cloud services that
you can use to backup your data.

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,830
These typically allow you to store and
synchronize your files online and

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,790
between computers.

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,650
Most offer a limited amount of space for
free and will charge you for

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,530
additional storage or premium services.

33
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,660
Common service providers are Dropbox,
Google Drive and OneDrive.

34
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,380
You can take a look at Wikipedia,
which has a through comparison.

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,060
There are some obvious advantages
to using cloud services for backup.

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,140
No user intervention is required, so you
don't need to change tapes, label cd's or

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,210
perform other manual tasks.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,770
They provide a remote offsite backup copy.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,570
Most provide encryption and versioning,
and they're multi-platform.

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,150
There are, however,
significant risks to using cloud services.

41
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,110
Some providers may store data outside
of the European economic area, so

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,980
you may be in breach of
the European Data Protection Directive, or

43
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,550
your research funder's policy.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,140
Restoration of the data may be
slow depending on your bandwidth.

45
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,758
The stored data may not be entirely
private if it's unencrypted,

46
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,363
and the service provider
may go out of business.
