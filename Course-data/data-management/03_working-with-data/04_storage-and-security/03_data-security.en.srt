00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,130
So what do we mean by data security?

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,240
Data security means ensuring that
your research data are kept safe from

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,110
corruption, and
that access is suitably controlled.

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,460
>> It's important to consider the security
of your data to prevent accidental or

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,870
malicious damage or modification,
theft, breach of confidentiality,

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,020
and premature release of the data.

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,220
>> Consider who'll need access to the data
and when and how you will enforce any

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,240
permissions or restrictions needed
>> You should also have a clear policy and

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,820
guidelines on who can make copies of the
data and whether these can be stored on

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,580
mobile devices such as laptops,
smart phones or USB sticks.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,650
This is particularly important if
you're creating sensitive data.

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,790
Making sure data is secure is part
of information technology security.

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,790
You should always have
up-to-date antivirus

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,030
software installed on your office and
home computers.

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,030
If you have sensitive data,

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,380
it's best to store them on a computer
that's not connected to any network.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,700
If this is impossible,
you should encrypt the data or the PC.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,020
Also bear in mind physical security.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,360
An unnetworked computer is still
vulnerable to theft or malicious damage or

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,770
modification of the data.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,110
Highly sensitive data should be stored in
a locked room or a safe when not in use.

22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,160
Such data shouldn't be stored or
transmitted without encryption.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,940
One basic aspect of security, that's often
overlooked, is user names and passwords.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,240
There are some simple principles
that you should follow here.

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,640
You shouldn't use your user name in your
email address or your Twitter handle.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,350
Try to use an alias instead.

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,660
Avoid using really obvious phrases for
your password.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,750
Such as your car registration number,
your pet's name, your phone number or

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,160
other dictionary words.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,910
You shouldn't write your password down
on Post-it notes or read it aloud,

31
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,760
as you type it in.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100
And you should avoid using
the same password for

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,485
a cloud service that you use for
your university login.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,030
Last but not least,
you should avoid signing into secure sites

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,020
from untrusted computers or
networks such as Internet cafes,
