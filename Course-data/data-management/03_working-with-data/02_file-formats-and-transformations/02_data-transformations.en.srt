00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:15,719
It's also a good idea to
consider data transformations.

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,448
There are a number of reasons,
why you may wish to transform your data,

3
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,889
either during your project, or afterwards.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,190
Unlike the earlier discussion about
migrating files from one format

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,910
to the other, data transformations
involve changing the actual data.

6
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,910
For example via anonymization.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,800
For example in survey data collected
from questionnaires, multiple choice and

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,310
other kinds of responses are usually coded
as numbers instead of character strings.

9
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,260
This simple type of transformation has
the advantage of easing data entry

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,700
if you're typing in paper responses, and

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,695
it also avoids inconsistencies
such as typos in data values.

12
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:01,895
Qualitative data such as interview
transcripts, can be transformed into

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:07,530
quantitative data by applying textual
coding and categorization techniques.

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,260
Another reason for data transformation may
be to visualize the data more effectively.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,500
A simple example is converting data where
there's a numerator and a denominator

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,730
from ratios to percentages, so you can
display it on a bar chart or pie graph.

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,020
A number of methods may be used
to transform confidential or

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,940
sensitive data, so
they can be shared with other researchers.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,500
These include aggregation,
and anonymization.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,820
You've now completed this module.

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,850
Take a look at the further reading, where
you'll find additional resources to learn

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,230
more about file formats, compression,
normalization, and data transformations.

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,380
You may wish to move on to the next module
and return to these references later.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,120
We recommend that you move on to
the module about documentation and

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,053
data citation.
