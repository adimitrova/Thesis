in this module, youll introduced 
to concepts file formats, 
compression, data normalization, 
transformations 
end module, 
youll understand important 
youll able to make decisions 
approach to use 
youll also able to use 
content featured in module 
to help improve research 
data management practice 
so is a file format 
a file format is a way encoding 
information within a computer file 
a program an application 
needs to recognize that file 
format in order to able to 
access content within file 
a web browser, example, 
will recognize html, things in hypertext 
markup language, will able to open 
files display webpages 
if a browser comes across a different type 
file might call a special kind 
plugin to able to open 
display files 
otherwise, if doesnt recognize 
file type, may offer option to 
download file so 
you open relevant program 
file format is often indicated 
part file name in an extension 
suffix 
conventionally, extension follows 
a full stop in file name, 
three four letters that 
identify format jpg 
jpegs, docx a word document 
files in proprietary formats usually 
to opened specific 
software in theyve created 
so this means that somebody 
without a license 
that software cant 
always open files 
in contrast, open formats ones 
in software company 
collective thats created that 
software, made openly available 
this usually means that a number 
applications developed 
open types files 
adobe pdf is good example 
an open format 
opened a number 
applications, adobe products 
file types based either text 
binary encoding 
text files machine readable 
character encoding standards, 
ascii unicode, 
whereas binary files run applicable 
software may proprietary 
binary formats executed 
file types include binary 
text, rich text format 
a big advantage creating 
saving research data in a text format 
is that file read in a plain 
text editor, like windows notepad, 
is humanreadable 
opened in operating system 
a wide range applications 
wellknown file extensions 
plain text files txt, 
csv, asc, html, xml 
software packages allow export 
exchange formats, so 
you create a text file 
import another program 
example, in microsoft excel, you 
save spreadsheet a csv file 
file formats that open, 
nonproprietary 
in widespread use, stand best chance 
readable well future 
in contrast, proprietary formats, 
especially that nonstandard, 
that require specific 
software applications 
particular versions that software, 
likely to pose issues future use 
rapid changes in technology in market 
mean that file formats 
quickly become obsolete 
this obviously negative connotations 
longterm preservation reuse 
if you want data 
to accessible later, 
youre best to convert 
to open standards 
data formats that conform to 
agreed international standards 
less likely to become obsolete, 
there a range software 
applications that read 
there may well tradeoffs in terms 
software functionality though, 
a loss formatting macros 
sometimes there is a de 
facto standard thats used 
pdf example become de facto 
standard publishing documents 
web in a way that retains 
original layout, fonts, text 
point research, 
you may need to convert 
migrate data files 
one format to another 
this could youve upgraded 
pc, youve got new software, youre 
sharing data a collaborator uses 
different software, youre using a shared 
platform, simply you want 
data files to readable in future 
a checksum algorithm tool 
used to compare bits a file 
moved 
one medium to another 
checksums typically 
run repositories 
to perform data integrity checks 
wont work however, 
if file format changed 
if youre comparing files across 
different computing platforms 
point research you 
may choose to compress files 
this could to fit onto 
a particular storage device 
transmission transportation 
compression is also known 
bitrate reduction 
involves encoding 
information in fewer bits 
original representation 
zip is a de facto standard compression 
format thats used windows, 
macs, linux, unix platforms 
zip is a lossless type compression, 
means file identical 
to original you unzip 
there also lossy types compression 
associated multimedia file 
formats 
may result in 
kind distortion 
loss quality fidelity played 
tar, tape archive files, 
commonly used in unix 
linux to bundle a set files one 
tar files may also zipped 
to reduce file size 
lossiness one 
trade compression 
another is amount processing 
time takes to compress 
decompress files use 
amount computing resource 
needed also an issue, 
particularly in case 
large files shared servers
