also a good idea to 
consider data transformations 
there a number reasons, 
you may wish to transform data, 
either project, afterwards 
unlike earlier discussion 
migrating files one format 
to other, data transformations 
involve changing actual data 
example via anonymization 
example in survey data collected 
questionnaires, multiple choice 
kinds responses usually coded 
numbers instead character strings 
this simple type transformation 
advantage easing data entry 
if youre typing in paper responses, 
also avoids inconsistencies 
typos in data values 
qualitative data interview 
transcripts, transformed 
quantitative data applying textual 
coding categorization techniques 
another reason data transformation may 
to visualize data effectively 
a simple example is converting data 
theres a numerator a denominator 
ratios to percentages, so you 
display a bar chart pie graph 
a number methods may used 
to transform confidential 
sensitive data, so 
shared researchers 
include aggregation, 
anonymization 
youve completed this module 
take a look reading, 
youll find additional resources to learn 
file formats, compression, 
normalization, data transformations 
you may wish to move to next module 
return to references later 
we recommend that you move to
