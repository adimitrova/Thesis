it
's
also
a
good
idea
to
consider
data
transformations
.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
,
why
you
may
wish
to
transform
your
data
,
either
during
your
project
,
or
afterwards
.
unlike
the
earlier
discussion
about
migrating
files
from
one
format
to
the
other
,
data
transformations
involve
changing
the
actual
data
.
for
example
via
anonymization
.
for
example
in
survey
data
collected
from
questionnaires
,
multiple
choice
and
other
kinds
of
responses
are
usually
coded
as
numbers
instead
of
character
strings
.
this
simple
type
of
transformation
has
the
advantage
of
easing
data
entry
if
you
're
typing
in
paper
responses
,
and
it
also
avoids
inconsistencies
such
as
typos
in
data
values
.
qualitative
data
such
as
interview
transcripts
,
can
be
transformed
into
quantitative
data
by
applying
textual
coding
and
categorization
techniques
.
another
reason
for
data
transformation
may
be
to
visualize
the
data
more
effectively
.
a
simple
example
is
converting
data
where
there
's
a
numerator
and
a
denominator
from
ratios
to
percentages
,
so
you
can
display
it
on
a
bar
chart
or
pie
graph
.
a
number
of
methods
may
be
used
to
transform
confidential
or
sensitive
data
,
so
they
can
be
shared
with
other
researchers
.
these
include
aggregation
,
and
anonymization
.
you
've
now
completed
this
module
.
take
a
look
at
the
further
reading
,
where
you
'll
find
additional
resources
to
learn
more
about
file
formats
,
compression
,
normalization
,
and
data
transformations
.
you
may
wish
to
move
on
to
the
next
module
and
return
to

references
later
.
we
recommend
that
you
move
on
to
the
module
about
documentation
and
data
citation
.
