1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:16,029
To start with, I was wondering if you
could give me an overview of your project.

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,530
And sort of the aims of the project,
just in a couple sentences.

3
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,750
>> Yeah, sure.
So the Comparative Agendas Project, or

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,820
CAP for short,
is actually a bit of a misnomer.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
In reality,
the CAP is a network of more than

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,060
two dozen international projects on
the national and sub-national level.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,080
All interested in measuring policy
attention through public and

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,590
governmental agendas.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,400
>> Can you briefly describe
how you organize your data,

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,920
in relation to perhaps
file naming conventions,

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,918
versioning Documentation,
which obviously features quite heavily.

12
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,380
Metadata, etc.

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,980
>> In terms of the overall project, in
terms of bringing everything together and

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,650
actually making it comparative,
documentation plays a very important role.

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,580
These include the sort of master
code book that I talked about.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,160
Sort of documents all the of
the inter-relations between the projects.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,730
As in, if these are the things that
are included in health care in Mexico,

18
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,720
for instance.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,450
What are the things that are included
in health care in Denmark,

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,820
in terms of that there are some things,
in terms of that's the broad policy area.

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,860
But there are some issue that might
only be covered in one country,

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,587
some issues that might only be
covered in another country.

23
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:39,453
Also includes the complete documentation
which I have already mentioned in

24
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:44,243
terms of the adnotated code books for
each individual langauge that allows

25
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:48,424
different language users not only
to trace the entire process but

26
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:53,215
they understand the data regardless
of what language they are approaching

27
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:57,548
things from and the sort of other
just broad documents talking about

28
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:01,530
the process of creating
the master code book itself.

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,920
And also, the process for

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,290
any new projects that might be interested
in joining the community as we're very

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,600
sort of open community interested in other
researchers that are looking to sort of

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,930
expand what we're doing and
whatever in a particular way.

33
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,910
Just as important as sort of
those documentation materials is

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,250
detailed metadata.

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,820
For so many data sets, so many different
languages, it's very important to keep

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,090
track of what each individual data
set measures in a particular way.

37
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,720
Oftentimes including more complete write
up than you would traditionally think of

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,790
with metadata.

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,480
Explaining, say, what is a law in the UK?

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,280
What is a law in the United States?

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,760
What is a law in another country?

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,740
>> And one final question, I guess it's in
relation to new researches coming onboard.

43
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,820
Do you have any advice in
relation to organizing?

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,763
Documenting or storing data that
will keep the new researcher on

45
00:02:56,763 --> 00:03:02,050
track in relation tp managing that
content for their own purpose.

46
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,430
>> Yeah, absolutely.

47
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,900
So as a researcher who, so I deal with

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,610
quite a lot of different types of data
sets, quite a lot of different data sets.

49
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,650
In general with different data structures,
partially because

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,140
the data structures relate to different
tools, different methods that I might

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,340
use which means that while a data
set might all be based off laws.

52
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,350
There might be many different data
structures of laws that I will look at.

53
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,080
In relation to the particular
statistical method that I used.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,450
In that sort of sense, both because
what you might want to do with data and

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,240
the fact that oftentimes with large data
sets, the type of large data sets that

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,070
a lot people are gathering now, you
might envision a particular use for it.

57
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,770
That particular use might be for example,

58
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,670
you want to look at law
production on a yearly level.

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,290
I cross many different countries,
and you decide to

60
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,210
potentially just make a yearly data set,
maybe throw away some sort of data,

61
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,280
because it just becomes excessive in terms
of when that individual law might have

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,870
been actually put on the books
in a particular way.

63
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,240
I would advise researchers away from
doing that, and advise them to keep.

64
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,140
The sort of raw data,
every bit of information that they did or

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,560
were able to gather whenever they're
building their data set, keep that,

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,930
store that and be able to access that.

67
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,650
You never know whenever you might
want to actually sort of change that

68
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,650
to a quarterly analysis or
a monthly analysis.

69
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,510
Or you might want to look at there's a
particular anomaly in some sort of way and

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,560
you need to investigate
that in more detail.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,600
So, I find it's generally best when you're
working with data to work with the raw

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,220
dataset and to transform that dataset into
what you need for that particular project.

73
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,570
Oftentimes documenting some sort of way,

74
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,940
whether that'd be documenting by hand
using sort of the documentation for

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,180
the statistical software that
you're using to transform the data.

76
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,285
Such as R, MathLab or Stata or other sort
of software in whatever particular way.

77
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:00,860
Using their log files, using their new
files or other things to be able to

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,770
document everything that you did so they
can easily go back and change things, but

79
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,340
also so that you can easily debug any
sort of issues that you might have.

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,470
Especially in very large data sets you
might not notice that there was something

81
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,210
wrong with a calculation or
a transposition of the data.

82
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,440
>> Yeah.
>> Without changing into a wide data set

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,530
format or a long data set format if you're
working on panel data for instance.

84
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,910
So keep all that archived,
keeping all that tracked so

85
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,850
that you can fix things
whenever you see errors.

86
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,710
So, you can easily change your data set
to answer knew or different questions.

87
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,760
It's very good for you and it's very good
for the people who might be interested in

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,100
using your data for other purposes
that you haven't envisioned and

89
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,000
while we all sort of want the outputs from
our own data in whatever sort of way,

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,940
we want the research outputs and
we want other things.

91
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,990
We want the impact.

92
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,030
Getting people to use the data is a very
big part of that impact, very big part of

93
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,725
getting people to cite, to care about
the work that you're doing as well.

94
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:05,968
>> [INAUDIBLE]
Sean, many thanks.

95
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,006
>> Thank you.
