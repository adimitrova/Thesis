to start with, i wondering if you 
could give an overview project 
sort aims project, 
in a couple sentences 
yeah, sure 
so comparative agendas project, 
cap short, 
is actually a bit a misnomer 
in reality, 
cap is a network 
two dozen international projects 
national subnational level 
interested in measuring policy 
attention public 
governmental agendas 
you briefly describe 
you organize data, 
in relation to perhaps 
file naming conventions, 
versioning documentation, 
obviously features quite heavily 
metadata, etc 
in terms overall project, in 
terms bringing everything together 
actually making comparative, 
documentation plays a important role 
include sort master 
code book that i talked 
sort documents 
interrelations between projects 
in, if things that 
included in health care in mexico, 
instance 
things that included 
in health care in denmark, 
in terms that there things, 
in terms thats broad policy area 
there issue that might 
covered in one country, 
issues that might 
covered in another country 
also includes complete documentation 
i already mentioned in 
terms adnotated code books 
individual langauge that allows 
different language users 
to trace entire process 
understand data regardless 
language approaching 
things sort 
broad documents talking 
process creating 
master code book 
also, process 
new projects that might interested 
in joining community 
sort open community interested in 
researchers that looking to sort 
expand 
whatever in a particular way 
important sort 
documentation materials is 
detailed metadata 
so many data sets, so many different 
languages, important to keep 
track individual data 
set measures in a particular way 
oftentimes including complete write 
you would traditionally think 
metadata 
explaining, say, is a law in uk 
is a law in united states 
is a law in another country 
one final question, i guess in 
relation to new researches coming onboard 
you advice in 
relation to organizing 
documenting storing data that 
will keep new researcher 
track in relation tp managing that 
content purpose 
yeah, absolutely 
so a researcher who, so i deal 
quite a lot different types data 
sets, quite a lot different data sets 
in general different data structures, 
partially 
data structures relate to different 
tools, different methods that i might 
use means that while a data 
set might based laws 
there might many different data 
structures laws that i will look 
in relation to particular 
statistical method that i used 
in that sort sense, 
you might want to data 
fact that oftentimes large data 
sets, type large data sets that 
a lot people gathering now, you 
might envision a particular use 
that particular use might example, 
you want to look law 
production a yearly level 
i cross many different countries, 
you decide to 
potentially make a yearly data set, 
maybe throw away sort data, 
becomes excessive in terms 
that individual law might 
actually put books 
in a particular way 
i would advise researchers away 
that, advise to keep 
sort raw data, 
every bit information that 
able to gather whenever theyre 
building data set, keep that, 
store that able to access that 
you never know whenever you might 
want to actually sort change that 
to a quarterly analysis 
a monthly analysis 
you might want to look theres a 
particular anomaly in sort way 
you need to investigate 
that in detail 
so, i find generally best youre 
working data to work raw 
dataset to transform that dataset 
you need that particular project 
oftentimes documenting sort way, 
whether thatd documenting hand 
using sort documentation 
statistical software that 
youre using to transform data 
r, mathlab stata sort 
software in whatever particular way 
using log files, using new 
files things to able to 
document everything that you so 
easily go back change things, 
also so that you easily debug 
sort issues that you might 
especially in large data sets you 
might notice that there something 
wrong a calculation 
a transposition data 
yeah 
without changing a wide data set 
format a long data set format if youre 
working panel data instance 
so keep that archived, 
keeping that tracked so 
that you fix things 
whenever you see errors 
so, you easily change data set 
to answer knew different questions 
good you good 
people might interested in 
using data purposes 
that you havent envisioned 
while we sort want outputs 
data in whatever sort way, 
we want research outputs 
we want things 
we want impact 
getting people to use data is a 
big part that impact, big part 
getting people to cite, to care 
work that youre well 
inaudible 
sean, many thanks 
thank you
