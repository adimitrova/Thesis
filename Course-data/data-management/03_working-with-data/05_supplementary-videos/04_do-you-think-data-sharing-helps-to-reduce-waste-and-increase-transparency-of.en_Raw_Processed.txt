you think data sharing 
helps to reduce waste 
increase transparency research 
i guess this is another 
obvious question 
answer must yes 
we produce tons data, 
basically lost 
one gets to know 
that data is useless 
we always create data 
that done rather properly 
so forth 
we a lot data 
is extremely useful, 
goes reports, 
papers 
but, usually original data, 
usually a means 
compound data 
so sharing, i think sharing 
original data that is actually 
we write about, 
would extremely helpful 
others to extract additional information 
to answer questions that might have, 
we didnt so forth 
also to check quality work, 
so sharing data i think is another, 
in a way, brainer, something 
that researchers dont like to 
well, im a big fan data sharing 
use data 
so much data is wasted, 
so much research is wasted 
to reduce waste 
we to remember will 
increase knowledge creation 
im interested 
in this knowledge creation story, 
clinical trials happening 
world, 
if you combine data, 
you get efficient research 
you course thats automatically 
reducing waste time 
so 
two areas ive used data sharing 
one is individual patient 
systematic reviews, 
youre a review 
studies in one area 
you use published data 
that, actually effort 
you get a lot done 
if you use original data 
that requires a standardization 
process, cleaning process, 
so youve got common outcomes, etc 
second use data sharing 
is to ask secondary questions, 
so quite a lot research ive 
done taken existing databases 
asked new questions databases 
sometimes trials that 
ive involved in personally, 
sometimes getting data sets 
people to that 
means much easier to that 
to spend hundreds thousands, 
if sometimes, 
millions dollars pounds 
in getting an original data set that would 
answered exactly question 
so data sharing achieve is 
ability to answer a research 
question available data 
you dont need to go gather 
to actually answer question 
so example, a systematic review 
individual patient data metaanalysis 
available data may successfully 
answer a research question 
without needing to get another research 
grant to go collect data 
help transparency 
so you mean 
help transparency 
well, increase transparency 
research, this sharing data 
well i think so 
you share data, 
you exposing 
to need external validation 
another group researchers, 
so will always, 
always, seek to confirm 
that youre data show you said 
showed you published initially 
so i think you subject 
to scrutiny 
i think making an expectation 
researchers also means that 
careful in way 
collect document research in 
first place, knowing that data 
sharing is one day ahead
