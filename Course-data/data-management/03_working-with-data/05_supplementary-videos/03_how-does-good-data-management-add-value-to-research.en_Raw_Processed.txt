one key issues you plan, 
design in research project is 
to a data management plan 
students usually forget, get so 
obsessed methodology that forget 
theyre supposed to collect data, 
to record keep 
one good things is, you apply 
ethics, you to think it, 
is quite helpful, one 
things that i always tell students 
i think is helpful 
is to think 
is 
data management plan 
auditing that this actually works 
like anything else in research 
even in clinical practice if 
you give an intervention 
if you dont know if works, you 
actually might harm goods 
so if we data management plan, we 
a plan youre auditing that data 
is collected you think is collected, 
quality data is good, 
you will surprised sometimes 
that even easiest data collection, 
if you dont an audit 
behind you, you might end errors 
in that could later in project 
helpful to prevent early

especially rare cancers, 
common cancers a rare offshoot 
way you find 
illnesses, way we really know 
know treatments actually going to 
work, is sharing data across patients, 
across countries, 
making sure is comparable 
free to everybody to use it, 
legitimate research purposes 
so 
good data managements absolutely crucial, 
an ethical responsibility that, 
researchers 
to honor data theyve 
provided put to best use 
also efficient, ethical 
minimizes wastage money 
thats invested in research, 
is ethical 
efficient, obligatory 
inaudible 
sharing data is 
really important transparency 
so if you data there 
available in a usable format, 
means people can, 
interrogate 
kind look work closely, 
also build upon it, so 
incorporate 
future research, 
become part a bigger project 
a master analysis anything inaudible 
really important to think
