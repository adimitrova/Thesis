00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,310
How does good data development
add value to research?

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,010
>> One of the key issues when you plan, or

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,740
design in your research project is
to have a data management plan.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,870
Students usually forget, they get so
obsessed with methodology that they forget

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:32,470
how they're supposed to collect data,
and how to record it and keep it.

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,920
One of the good things is, when you apply
for ethics, you have to think about it,

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,700
which is quite helpful, but one of
the things that I always tell my students

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,330
which I think is helpful
is to think about.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,000
What is your for
your data management plan?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,530
How your auditing that this actually works
because like anything else in research or

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,450
even in clinical practice if
you give an intervention.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,480
If you don't know if it works, you
actually might have more harm than goods.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,620
So if we data management plan, we have
a plan how you're auditing that the data

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,780
is collected as you think it is collected,
and the quality of data is good, and

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,980
you will be surprised as sometimes
that even the easiest data collection,

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,045
if you don't have an audit.

17
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:20,735
Behind you, you might end up with errors
in it that could be later in the project.

18
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:22,995
It's helpful to prevent it early on.

19
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:27,845
>> As a patient I have two
views on good data management.

20
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:32,055
The first view is that good data
management is keeping it safe,

21
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:36,360
not giving it to people who shouldn't have
it, not leaving it around lying on trains

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,850
because that's what the newspapers
tells me happens to it.

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,630
It's sold to insurance companies and
goodness knows what else.

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,250
So on the one hand,
that's good data management.

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,900
Keeping it safe, keeping my anonymity
preserved, but on the other hand,

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,860
as a patient who's had some serious
illnesses, including cancer.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,540
Good data management is actually making
sure its curated in the right way

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,870
to be shared with other researchers,
especially for rare cancers, or

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,220
common cancers with a rare offshoot.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,650
The only way you find out about these
illnesses, the only way we really know

31
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,570
Know what treatments are actually going to
work, is by sharing data across patients,

32
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,880
across countries, and
making sure it is comparable and

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,660
free to everybody to use it, for
legitimate research purposes.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,420
>> So
good data management's absolutely crucial,

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,250
it's an ethical responsibility that,
>> Researchers have

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,550
to honor the data they've been
provided with and put it to best use.

37
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,350
It's also efficient, not just ethical.

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,960
It minimizes the wastage of money
that's been invested in the research,

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,195
and not only is it ethical and
efficient, it's obligatory.

40
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:51,330
[INAUDIBLE]
>> Sharing your data is

41
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,830
really important for transparency.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,750
So if you have your data there and it's
available and it's in a usable format,

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,300
then it means other people can,
not just interrogate it and

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,320
kind of Look at your work more closely,
but they can also build upon it, so

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,910
they can incorporate it into
their future research, or

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,730
it can become part of a bigger project or
a master analysis or anything [INAUDIBLE].

47
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,759
It's really important to think
about how you're going to

48
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,800
share your data with other people and
plan ahead for that.
