thank you so much 
coming to speak to us today 
could you tell us in a couple 
sentences you 
you a researcher 
research is 
yep, name is natalia calanzani, 
im a research fellow 
university edinburgh 
i currently work 
feasibility study, 
trying to increase uptake 
bowel cancer screening 
so that involves a database analysis 
still waiting data set, 
collecting data in primary care 
great, i ask 
strategies file management, 
file naming, versioning, 
generally organizing data 
that help you 
collaborators make sense collected 
data leave an audit trail 

so, we a server here 
university we 
store every file project 
researchers received 
ethical approval to check files, 
access 
we name files based 
versions dates created 
we try to use underscores instead 
spaces we know that 
depending system youre using, if 
you spaces you might problems 
this is important 
us to consistent also so 
we make sure using file 
approved ethics 
we end so 
many different versions 
so, good you to keep track 
exactly you using 
i to admit that we could improve 
file becomes obsolete 
we still keeping there so 
is quite cluttered moment so we 
couldnt improve that 
you rely 
institutional storage back 
systems in course research 
you know 
data kept secure 
yes, so if youre dealing patient 
data identifiable information, 
likely that going to 
mandatory you to write forms 
applications 
lots applications explaining 
data kept secure 
here university, 
information services helped 
us to develop forms 
explained to us 
data stored, 
backup systems worked 
helped us develop a diagram 
showing we access data, 
data protected 
so i think quite certain that 
everything is well kept protected 
methods 
available to you to protect patient 
confidentiality 
so we patient databases, 
like i mentioned, allowed 
to publish anything 
less five cases 
if you less five 
cases a rare condition 
something youre 
supposed to report that 
course, allowed to copy 
data sets to computers 
stay secure in server 
we dont copy to sb well, 
example, that avoids a lot issues 
people received 
approval to access data sets, 
access this data 
in terms patient form that 
we that collect data 
primary care practices, kept 
locked in cabinets in offices 
well, thank you much 
good luck research 
thank you
