1
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,180
Do you think data sharing
helps to reduce waste and

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,090
increase transparency of research?

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,800
>> I guess this is another
very obvious question and

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,630
the answer must be yes because
we produce tons of data,

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:30,940
which are basically just lost because
no one gets to know about it.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,840
Some of that data is useless
because we not always create data

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,110
that was done rather properly and
so forth.

8
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,630
But we have a lot of data
which is extremely useful,

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,280
which goes into our reports,
into our papers.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,990
But, it's usually not the original data,

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,890
it's usually just a means and
compound data.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,115
And so sharing, I think sharing
the original data that is actually

13
00:00:56,115 --> 00:01:00,750
what we write about,
would be extremely helpful for

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,790
others to extract additional information
to answer questions that they might have,

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,030
which we didn't have and so forth.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,750
Also to check on the quality of our work,
so sharing data I think is another,

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,280
in a way, no brainer, but it's something
that researchers don't like to do.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,580
>> Well, I'm a big fan of data sharing and
the use of data.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,220
Because so much data is wasted, and
so much research is then wasted.

20
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,420
And it's not just to reduce waste.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,040
We have to remember it will
increase the knowledge creation.

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,410
And I'm more and more interested
in this knowledge creation story,

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,460
because clinical trials are happening
all over the world, and

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,750
if you can combine those data,
you get more efficient research and

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,790
you can of course that's automatically
reducing waste at the same time.

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,160
>> So
two areas where I've used data sharing.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,950
One is individual patient
systematic reviews,

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,310
where you're doing a review of
all the studies in one area.

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,700
You can use the published data for
that, but actually it's more effort but

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,450
you can get a lot more done
if you use the original data.

31
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,450
But that requires a standardization
process, cleaning up process,

32
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,210
so you've got common outcomes, etc.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,260
The second use for data sharing
is to ask secondary questions,

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,820
so quite a lot of the research I've
done has taken existing databases but

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,040
asked new questions of those databases.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,360
Sometimes it's been trials that
I've been involved in personally,

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,670
sometimes it's getting data sets
from other people to do that.

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,050
But it means it's much easier to do that
than to spend the hundreds of thousands,

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,990
if not sometimes,
millions of dollars or pounds

40
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,120
in getting an original data set that would
have answered exactly the same question.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,350
>> So what data sharing can achieve is

42
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,710
the ability to answer a research
question with the available data.

43
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,260
When you don't need to go and gather any
more to actually answer the question.

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,670
So for example, a systematic review and
individual patient data meta-analysis of

45
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,130
all the available data may successfully
answer a research question

46
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,150
without needing to get another research
grant to go and collect more data.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,650
>> And does it help transparency then?

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,930
>> So what do you mean by
does it help transparency?

49
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,650
>> Well, does it increase the transparency
of research, this sharing of data.

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,200
>> Well I think so.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,020
When you share data,
you are exposing yourself

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,250
to the need for external validation
by another group of researchers,

53
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,200
so they will always,
they should always, seek to confirm

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,160
that you're data show what you said they
showed when you published them initially.

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,000
So I think you subject
yourself to scrutiny.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,953
And I think making it an expectation
of researchers also means that they

57
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:11,822
are very careful in the way they
collect and document their research in

58
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:16,627
the first place, knowing that data
sharing is one day ahead of them.
