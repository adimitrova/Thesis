1
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:11,500
Thank you so much for
coming to speak to us today.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,750
Could you just tell us in a couple
of sentences who you are and

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,470
what you do as a researcher?

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,706
What your research is about.

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,492
>> Yep, my name is Natalia Calanzani,

6
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm a research fellow at
the University of Edinburgh.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,060
And I currently work on
the feasibility study,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,840
trying to increase the uptake
of bowel cancer screening.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,597
So that involves a database analysis but

10
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:36,791
we're still waiting on our data set,
and collecting data in primary care.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:41,260
>> Great, can I ask what are your
strategies for file management,

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,668
file naming, versioning,
just generally organizing data?

13
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:50,007
And how does that help you and your
collaborator's make sense of the collected

14
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,990
data and leave an audit trail for
yourselves?

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,100
>> So, we have a server here
at the university where we

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,978
store every file from the project.

17
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:04,990
And only the researchers who have received
ethical approval to check those files,

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,090
they can access those.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,270
And we name the files based on their
versions and the dates they were created.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,200
And we try to use underscores instead
of spaces because we know that

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,460
depending on the system you're using, if
you have spaces you might have problems.

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,970
And this is important for
us to be consistent but also so

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,510
we make sure we're using the file
which was been approved by ethics.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,241
Because we end up having so
many different versions.

25
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:34,598
So, it's good for you to keep track
of what exactly you are using.

26
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:39,067
And I have to admit that we could improve
because when the file becomes obsolete

27
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:43,400
we are still keeping those there so
it is quite cluttered at the moment .So we

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,011
couldn't improve on that
>> Do you rely on

29
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:52,218
institutional storage and back up
systems in the course of your research?

30
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:55,480
And how do you know your
data are being kept secure?

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,107
>> Yes, so if you're dealing with patient
data and identifiable information,

32
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:04,379
it's very likely that it's going to be
mandatory for you to write forms and

33
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,378
applications.

34
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:09,090
Lots of applications explaining
how data are kept secure.

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,375
And here at the university,

36
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,820
Information Services has helped
us to develop those forms.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,130
And they have explained to us
how our data are stored, and

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,310
how the backup systems worked.

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,140
And they helped us develop a diagram
showing how we access data, and

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,990
how the data are protected.

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,160
So I think we're quite certain that
everything is well kept and protected.

42
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,158
>> And what are some of the methods
available to you to protect patient

43
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,314
confidentiality.

44
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:42,008
>> So we for the patient databases,

45
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:47,372
like I mentioned, we're not allowed

46
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:53,918
to publish anything for
less than five cases.

47
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,926
If you had less than five
cases of a rare condition or

48
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,590
something you're not
supposed to report that.

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,800
And of course, we're not allowed to copy
these data sets to our own computers.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,460
They all stay secure in the server.

51
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,990
>> We don't copy them to SB6 as well, for
example, and that avoids a lot of issues.

52
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,405
And only people who have received
approval to access these data sets,

53
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,256
they access this data.

54
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:22,080
In terms of the patient form that
we have that collect data and

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,150
primary care practices, these are kept
locked In cabinets in our offices.

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,100
>> Well, thank you very much and
good luck with your research.

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,600
>> Thank you.
