it's also important to distinguish between the different versions of your data files consistently.
this ensures that there's a clear audit trail so you can track the development of your data files and return to earlier versions if needed.
you should pick a method of versioning that makes sense to you and makes it clear to differentiate between the different data files.
a common form for expressing data file versions is to use ordinal numbers such as 1, 2, and 3 for major version changes and decimals for minor changes.
for example, version 1.1. you should avoid using confusing labels such as revision, final, final2, or definitive copy.
you may find that these accumulate and it becomes difficult to understand which version proceeds which.
you should always record changes to your data no matter how small or insignificant they seem at the time.
you can use an auto backup facility for this, if one's available, rather than saving and archiving multiple versions.
you can also use a tracking facility on software such as google docs or on wiki's.
there are a number of version control softwares, such as subversion and tortoisesvn which are commonly used for software code.
remember that you can also delete or discard obsolete versions of your data.
just always be sure to retain the original rule copy.
so, you've now completed this module where we've introduced you to the concepts of good research data organization, including file naming conventions and versioning.
you can take a look at the further resources, where you'll find additional references and links that you can follow up for more information.
you may decide to come back to these later on, and start another module in the meantime.
if you do so, we recommend you move on to the data file formats module.
