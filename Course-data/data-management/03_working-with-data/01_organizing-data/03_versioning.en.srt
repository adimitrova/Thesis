1
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:16,077
It's also important to distinguish between
the different versions of your data

2
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:18,230
files consistently.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,967
This ensures that there's a clear audit
trail so you can track the development of

4
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:26,393
your data files and
return to earlier versions if needed.

5
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,765
You should pick a method of versioning
that makes sense to you and

6
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:33,340
makes it clear to differentiate
between the different data files.

7
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:40,886
A common form for expressing data file
versions is to use ordinal numbers such as

8
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:46,940
1, 2, and 3 for major version changes and
decimals for minor changes.

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,269
For example, version 1.1.

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,795
You should avoid using confusing
labels such as revision, final,

11
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,066
final2, or definitive copy.

12
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,312
You may find that these accumulate and

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,323
it becomes difficult to understand
which version proceeds which.

14
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:10,389
You should always record changes to
your data no matter how small or

15
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:12,720
insignificant they seem at the time.

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,500
You can use an auto backup facility for
this,

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,850
if one's available, rather than saving and
archiving multiple versions.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,335
You can also use a tracking facility on
software such as Google Docs or on Wiki's.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,180
There are a number of version control
softwares, such as Subversion and

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,320
TortoiseSVN which are commonly used for
software code.

21
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:42,740
Remember that you can also delete or
discard obsolete versions of your data.

22
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,310
Just always be sure to retain
the original rule copy.

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,650
So, you've now completed this module where
we've introduced you to the concepts of

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,680
good research data organization, including
file naming conventions and versioning.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,310
You can take a look at the further
resources, where you'll find additional

26
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,660
references and links that you can
follow up for more information.

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,140
You may decide to come back
to these later on, and

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,760
start another module in the meantime.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,687
If you do so, we recommend you move
on to the data file formats module.
