in
this
module
you
will
be
introduced
to
the
concept
of
data
organization
,
or
housekeeping
,
and
good
file
management
practices
.
by
the
end
of
the
module
,
you
'll
understand
why
this
is
important
.
and
the
benefits
of
file
versioning
,
naming
and
renaming
conventions
.
last
but
not
least
,
you
'll
be
able
to
apply
the
concepts
that
you
learn
in
this
module
to
help
you
manage
your
data
more
effectively
.
so
,
let
's
go
ahead
and
get
started
.
first
,
let
's
take
a
look
at
why
data
organization
is
so
important
.
at
the
start
of
your
research
project
it
's
really
easy
to
believe
that
you
'll
always
remember
how
you
're
going
to
name
your
files
and
where
you
've
stored
them
.
but
once
your
research
gets
underway
,
you
'll
very
quickly
accumulate
a
large
volume
of
data
.
you
'll
have
multiple
files
in
different
formats
and
lots
of
different
versions
.
and
it
's
not
only
the
data
files
either
.
you
're
likely
to
have
websites
maybe
blogs
,
articles
and
citations
,
methodologies
,
notes
and
spreadsheets
all
relating
to
your
research
.
so
if
you
're
trying
to
find
a
particular
data
file
that
you
need
,
especially
if
it
's
been
named
inaccurately
or
inconsistently
,
it
can
be
really
frustrating
,
and
a
significant
waste
of
research
time
.
good
file
management
practices
are
required
to
help
you
identify
,
locate
,
and
use
your
data
effectively
.
and
file
naming
conventions
are
really
important
if
you
're
wanting
to
share
your
data
with
collaborators
in
a
group
space
.
you
want
to
make
sure
you
're
all
applying
the
same
conventions
and
using
those
consistently
.
so
,
what
exactly
are
the
best
practices
in
organizing
your
data
?
firstly
,
research
data
files
and
folders
need
to
be
labeled
and
organized
in
a
systematic
way
,
so
they
're
both
identifiable
and
accessible
for
current
and
future
users
.
the
benefits
of
consistent
data
filing
labeling
are
numerous
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
some
of
these
.
data
files
are
distinguishable
from
each
other
within
their
containing
folder
.
they
're
easier
to
locate
and
browse
,
and
they
can
be
retrieved
not
only
by
the
creator
,
but
by
other
users
as
well
.
they
can
be
sorted
in
a
logical
sequence
and
are
not
accidentally
overwritten
or
deleted
.
last
,
but
not
least
,
good
data
file
naming
prevents
confusion
when
multiple
people
are
working
on
shared
files
.
