also important to distinguish between 
different versions data 
files consistently 
this ensures that theres a clear audit 
trail so you track development 
data files 
return to earlier versions if needed 
you pick a method versioning 
that makes sense to you 
makes clear to differentiate 
between different data files 
a common form expressing data file 
versions is to use ordinal numbers 
, , major version changes 
decimals minor changes 
example, version 
you avoid using confusing 
labels revision, final, 
final, definitive copy 
you may find that accumulate 
becomes difficult to understand 
version proceeds 
you always record changes to 
data matter small 
insignificant seem time 
you use an auto backup facility 
this, 
if ones available, rather saving 
archiving multiple versions 
you also use a tracking facility 
software google docs wikis 
there a number version control 
softwares, subversion 
tortoisesvn commonly used 
software code 
remember that you also delete 
discard obsolete versions data 
always sure to retain 
original rule copy 
so, youve completed this module 
weve introduced you to concepts 
good research data organization, including 
file naming conventions versioning 
you take a look 
resources, youll find additional 
references links that you 
follow information 
you may decide to come back 
to later on, 
start another module in meantime 
if you so, we recommend you move 
to data file formats module
