1
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:17,022
We'll now consider the three main criteria
that you need to think about when

2
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:21,268
you're deciding how to name and
label your research data files.

3
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,990
First up, is the organisation.

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,510
This is important for future access and
retrieval and should take into account any

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,900
file naming constraints that are applied
by the system where you store your data.

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,610
Second up, is the context.

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,870
This may include content specific or

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,850
descriptive information,
irrespective of where the data is stored.

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,098
And the third one is consistency.

10
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:52,796
You should choose a single file naming
convention and apply that consistently

11
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:56,720
throughout by including the same
information in the same order.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,884
So for
example if you're going to use dates,

13
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:06,058
you could follow a model like the ISO
standard, which applies four digits for

14
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:11,168
the year, two for the month and
two for the day, such as 20150907.

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,728
Whichever method you decide to adopt,
just make sure you apply it consistently.

16
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:18,961
There are a number of common
elements that you should consider

17
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,768
when you're developing
your file naming strategy.

18
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:26,005
These include a version number,
the date of creation,

19
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:32,043
the name of the creator, the description
of the content, the name of the team or

20
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:39,330
department associated with the data,
a publication date, and a project number.

21
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,900
Finally, you want to think about scalable
your file naming policy should be.

22
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,740
If you want to include a project number,
don't limit yourself to two digits, or

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,350
you can only have 99 projects.

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,610
Don't use generic file names either,

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,860
that may conflict if your data were
moved from one system to another.

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,230
And if your working over
more than one computer,

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,755
make sure your files are synchronized.

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,940
File names should outlive the original
person who named the file, so

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,330
your best to adopt group guidelines rather
than everyone having their own procedure.

30
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,890
File and folder naming conventions
are key to maintaining

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,630
a well-organized electronic directory and
drive structure.

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,040
A file name is the chief identifier for
a research data file.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,950
In most cases,

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,530
the policy for file naming is left down
to individuals or research groups.

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,680
There are a number of easy rules
that you should be following

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,670
when naming your files.

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,530
Firstly, you should keep file
names short and relevant.

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,050
Generally about 25 characters
is a sufficient length

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,240
to capture enough descriptive information.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,520
You shouldn't use special characters in
a file name, as these are often use for

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,030
special tasks in different
operating systems.

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,180
You should use underscores instead
of full stops, or spaces, and

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,330
if you include dates,
you should format them consistently.

44
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,050
Never assume that
a software application or

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,820
instrument uses case dependency when
naming and renaming your flies.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,520
So how do you rename hundreds of files?

47
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,336
Well most operating systems have
in-built tools for file management.

48
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,927
There are also a number of software tools
that can help you to manage your data

49
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:31,890
files and folders in a more automated and
consistent way through batch renaming.

50
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,360
Batch renaming software exists for
most operating systems.

51
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,860
There are many situations in which
batch renaming may be useful.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,060
For example, where images from digital
cameras are automatically assigned

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,570
base file names,
consisting of lots of sequential numbers.

54
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,400
Where proprietary software, or

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,240
instrumentation generates crude,
default, or multiple file names.

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,255
And where files are transferred from
a system that support spaces or

57
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:04,290
non-English characters,
to one that doesn't.

58
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,802
Batch renaming software can be used
to substitute such characters with

59
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,010
acceptable ones.

60
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,075
There are some bulk renaming tools for

61
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:15,310
different operating systems
listed in the Mantra course.
