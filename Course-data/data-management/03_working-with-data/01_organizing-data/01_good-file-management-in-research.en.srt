1
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:16,637
In this module you will be introduced
to the concept of data organization, or

2
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:20,350
housekeeping, and
good file management practices.

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,840
By the end of the module,
you'll understand why this is important.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
And the benefits of file versioning,
naming and renaming conventions.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,750
Last but not least, you'll be able to
apply the concepts that you learn in this

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,300
module to help you manage
your data more effectively.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,940
So, let's go ahead and get started.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,660
First, let's take a look at why
data organization is so important.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,900
At the start of your research project it's
really easy to believe that you'll always

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,090
remember how you're going to name your
files and where you've stored them.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,470
But once your research gets underway,

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,150
you'll very quickly accumulate
a large volume of data.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,300
You'll have multiple files in different
formats and lots of different versions.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,682
And it's not only the data files either.

15
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:12,120
You're likely to have websites maybe
blogs, articles and citations,

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,210
methodologies, notes and spreadsheets
all relating to your research.

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,700
So if you're trying to find
a particular data file that you need,

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,590
especially if it's been named
inaccurately or inconsistently,

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,620
it can be really frustrating, and
a significant waste of research time.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,470
Good file management practices are
required to help you identify, locate, and

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,970
use your data effectively.

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,110
And file naming conventions
are really important

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,310
if you're wanting to share your data
with collaborators in a group space.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,480
You want to make sure you're all
applying the same conventions and

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,710
using those consistently.

26
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,650
So, what exactly are the best
practices in organizing your data?

27
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,690
Firstly, research data files and
folders need to be labeled and

28
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,460
organized in a systematic way, so they're
both identifiable and accessible for

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,350
current and future users.

30
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,780
The benefits of consistent data
filing labeling are numerous.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,250
Let's take a look at some of these.

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,740
Data files are distinguishable from each
other within their containing folder.

33
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,380
They're easier to locate and browse, and

34
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,370
they can be retrieved not only by
the creator, but by other users as well.

35
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,470
They can be sorted in a logical sequence
and are not accidentally overwritten or

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,960
deleted.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,893
Last, but not least, good data file
naming prevents confusion when multiple

38
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,220
people are working on shared files.
