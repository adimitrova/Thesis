well consider three main criteria 
that you need to think 
youre deciding to name 
label research data files 
first up, is organisation 
this is important future access 
retrieval take account 
file naming constraints that applied 
system you store data 
second up, is context 
this may include content specific 
descriptive information, 
irrespective data is stored 
third one is consistency 
you choose a single file naming 
convention apply that consistently 
throughout including 
information in order 
so 
example if youre going to use dates, 
you could follow a model like iso 
standard, applies four digits 
year, two month 
two day, 
whichever method you decide to adopt, 
make sure you apply consistently 
there a number common 
elements that you consider 
youre developing 
file naming strategy 
include a version number, 
date creation, 
name creator, description 
content, name team 
department associated data, 
a publication date, a project number 
finally, you want to think scalable 
file naming policy 
if you want to include a project number, 
dont limit to two digits, 
you projects 
dont use generic file names either, 
that may conflict if data 
moved one system to another 
if working 
one computer, 
make sure files synchronized 
file names outlive original 
person named file, so 
best to adopt group guidelines rather 
everyone procedure 
file folder naming conventions 
key to maintaining 
a wellorganized electronic directory 
drive structure 
a file name is chief identifier 
a research data file 
in cases, 
policy file naming is left 
to individuals research groups 
there a number easy rules 
that you following 
naming files 
firstly, you keep file 
names short relevant 
generally characters 
is a sufficient length 
to capture enough descriptive information 
you shouldnt use special characters in 
a file name, often use 
special tasks in different 
operating systems 
you use underscores instead 
full stops, spaces, 
if you include dates, 
you format consistently 
never assume that 
a software application 
instrument uses case dependency 
naming renaming flies 
so you rename hundreds files 
well operating systems 
inbuilt tools file management 
there also a number software tools 
that help you to manage data 
files folders in a automated 
consistent way batch renaming 
batch renaming software exists 
operating systems 
there many situations in 
batch renaming may useful 
example, images digital 
cameras automatically assigned 
base file names, 
consisting lots sequential numbers 
proprietary software, 
instrumentation generates crude, 
default, multiple file names 
files transferred 
a system that support spaces 
nonenglish characters, 
to one that doesnt 
batch renaming software used 
to substitute characters 
acceptable ones 
there bulk renaming tools 
different operating systems 
listed in mantra course
