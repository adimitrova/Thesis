1
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:16,884
In this module, you'll be introduced
to the concepts of documentation and

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:17,966
data citation.

3
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:22,429
By the end of the module, you'll
understand why documentation is important,

4
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,300
and how and when to use metadata.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,600
You'll also understand
the relevance of data citation, and

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,630
will learn how to do this.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,190
So why document your data?

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,650
By documenting your data systematically,
you'll first and foremost help yourself.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,810
You may be very familiar with your
data when you're first creating it.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,760
But the chances that you'll remember
what all of the variables and

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,330
abbreviations mean in several months or
years are slim.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,820
The importance of documenting your data
while you're creating and analyzing it,

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,100
and everything is still fresh in
your mind, can't be overestimated.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,680
Others will also need good
documentation to understand your work.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,680
This is particularly important if they're
going to review your publications, try and

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,650
validate your research findings, or
even use your data in new studies.

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,600
Some examples of data
documentation are lab notebooks and

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,632
experimental protocols,
questionnaires, codebooks,

19
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:26,510
data dictionaries,
software syntax and output files.

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,964
Information about your equipment
settings and calibration,

21
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:36,181
database schema, methodology reports,
and provenance information.

22
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,490
Laboratory notebooks are crucial
documents to be properly managed.

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,590
They can help in asserting
intellectual property rights, and

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,840
can even help you defend against
claims of scientific fraud.

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,130
In less extreme circumstances,

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,530
they can demonstrate adherence with
standards of good practice and

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,230
ethical integrity, and show compliance
with any contractual obligations.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,990
Routine documentation of all lab work

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,960
is an important responsibility
of laboratory researchers.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,810
There are three levels
of data documentation.

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,610
Let's take a look at them one by one.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,930
So first up we have project
level documentation.

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,290
Here you want to document
what the study set out to do,

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,570
what the research questions and
hypotheses were, and

35
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,330
what methodologies, sampling frames,
instruments, or measures were used.

36
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,010
This information may be included in
your theses, your published articles,

37
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,270
data papers or technical reports.

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,908
Second, we have file or
database level documentation.

39
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,000
A, you should document,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,300
how all of the files that make up
the dataset relate to one another.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,960
A readme.txt file is
a classic way of doing this.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,810
And finally, we have variable or
item level documentation.

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,260
This isn't just defining the variable
names at the top of the spreadsheet file,

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,680
but including a full label to explain
the meaning of that variable.

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,820
In the course of publishing research,
it's essential to cite your sources.

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,450
The reference list at the end of the
publication shows the credibility of your

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,680
claims and also the prominence of
a particular theory or school of thought.

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,867
So this is no less true for datasets than
for publications, but somehow the practice

49
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:28,264
of proper data citation has been slow
to take root in academic culture.

50
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:33,011
All too often we see very basic labels and
charts in publications,

51
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:37,929
such as Source: OECD, without any proper
information in the references

52
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:41,260
about how you can access
the underlying data.
