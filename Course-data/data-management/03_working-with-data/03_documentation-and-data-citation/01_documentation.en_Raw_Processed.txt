in this module, youll introduced 
to concepts documentation 
data citation 
end module, youll 
understand documentation is important, 
to use metadata 
youll also understand 
relevance data citation, 
will learn to this 
so document data 
documenting data systematically, 
youll first foremost help 
you may familiar 
data youre first creating 
chances that youll remember 
variables 
abbreviations mean in several months 
years slim 
importance documenting data 
while youre creating analyzing it, 
everything is still fresh in 
mind, cant overestimated 
others will also need good 
documentation to understand work 
this is particularly important if theyre 
going to review publications, try 
validate research findings, 
even use data in new studies 
examples data 
documentation lab notebooks 
experimental protocols, 
questionnaires, codebooks, 
data dictionaries, 
software syntax output files 
information equipment 
settings calibration, 
database schema, methodology reports, 
provenance information 
laboratory notebooks crucial 
documents to properly managed 
help in asserting 
intellectual property rights, 
even help you defend 
claims scientific fraud 
in less extreme circumstances, 
demonstrate adherence 
standards good practice 
ethical integrity, show compliance 
contractual obligations 
routine documentation lab work 
is an important responsibility 
laboratory researchers 
there three levels 
data documentation 
lets take a look one one 
so first we project 
level documentation 
here you want to document 
study set to do, 
research questions 
hypotheses were, 
methodologies, sampling frames, 
instruments, measures used 
this information may included in 
theses, published articles, 
data papers technical reports 
second, we file 
database level documentation 
a, you document, 
files that make 
dataset relate to one another 
a readmetxt file is 
a classic way this 
finally, we variable 
item level documentation 
this isnt defining variable 
names top spreadsheet file, 
including a full label to explain 
meaning that variable 
in course publishing research, 
essential to cite sources 
reference list end 
publication shows credibility 
claims also prominence 
a particular theory school thought 
so this is less true datasets 
publications, somehow practice 
proper data citation slow 
to take root in academic culture 
often we see basic labels 
charts in publications, 
source oecd, without proper 
information in references 
you access 
underlying data
