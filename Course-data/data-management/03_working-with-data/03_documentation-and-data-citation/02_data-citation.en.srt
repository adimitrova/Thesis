00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:12,968
In 2014,

2
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:19,440
a group called Force11 issued the Joint
Declaration on Data Citation Principles.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,250
This has been endorsed by
a number of scientific bodies and

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,350
publishers, as well as individuals.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,690
So why cite data?

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,050
By providing a citation for your data,

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,260
you make it easier for other users
to identify and acknowledge it.

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,760
Data citation helps promote
the reproduce-ability of research results,

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,620
it allows us to track the usage and
impact of data and

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,790
it provides a structure by which we can
recognize and reward data creators.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,480
So whats the best practice
in citing a data set?

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,500
As a general rule of thumb you want to
make sure you include enough information

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,577
for another use to be able
to locate the data set or

14
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:04,899
the part of the database
that you're referring to.

15
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,020
DataCite, an international
standards body founded in 2009,

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,670
recommends the following five
minimum citation elements.

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,360
A creator, a year of publication,
a title, publisher, and identifier.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,670
Here, identifier refers to any persistent
ID which uniquely identifies the object,

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,690
including a DOI or even a URL,
though this may be less persistent.

20
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,990
Two additional properties which may be
added are Version and ResourceType.

21
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,150
ResourceType refers to the class
of object that is being citied,

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,230
such as a dataset, database,
map, sound file or website.

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,540
The UK data service recommends using
a title that indicates the subject matter,

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,080
geography and
time period that the data covers.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's take a look at an example.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,330
When citing data it makes sense to try and
adopt the same style and

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,820
order of references as your other works.

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,600
Bibliographic style guides and
reference management software may help.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,020
But inevitably,
some judgment may be called for.

30
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,010
If so, err on the side of caution, and

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,120
always provide more information than
less to help the users find the data.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,700
In the case of a dynamic database,
that is continually updated,

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,050
it may be near impossible to refer back
to the exact version that you used.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,800
In such circumstances always
include a date of download.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,880
In the life sciences it's common
to include an accession number

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,090
with the database name when
you're referencing sequence data.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,910
You can see this in
the examples on screen.

38
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,490
So what if you're using
an unpublished data source?

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,810
Informal data sharing
is relatively common.

40
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,024
But even if the data are unpublished,
the citation principles still applies.

41
00:02:57,024 --> 00:03:00,800
If somebody shared data with you,
for example,

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,100
via an email attachment, you can reference
this as a private communication.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,470
Let's take a look at an example.

44
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,625
Last but not least, good practice in
data documentation and citation can

45
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:23,230
contribute to reaching a better standard
of reproducibility of research.

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,510
Reproducibility is a fundamental
principle of the scientific method.

47
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,080
So you've now completed this module.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,360
If you take a look in the further reading
section you'll find additional references

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,180
to get more information on
documentation and citation.

50
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,980
You can also move onto the next module,
which is on storage and security.
