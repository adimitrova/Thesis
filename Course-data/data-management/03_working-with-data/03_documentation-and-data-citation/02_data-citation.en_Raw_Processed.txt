a group called force issued joint 
declaration data citation principles 
this endorsed 
a number scientific bodies 
publishers, well individuals 
so cite data 
providing a citation data, 
you make easier users 
to identify acknowledge 
data citation helps promote 
reproduceability research results, 
allows us to track usage 
impact data 
provides a structure we 
recognize reward data creators 
so whats best practice 
in citing a data set 
a general rule thumb you want to 
make sure you include enough information 
another use to able 
to locate data set 
part database 
that youre referring to 
datacite, an international 
standards body founded in , 
recommends following five 
minimum citation elements 
a creator, a year publication, 
a title, publisher, identifier 
here, identifier refers to persistent 
id uniquely identifies object, 
including a doi even a url, 
though this may less persistent 
two additional properties may 
added version resourcetype 
resourcetype refers to class 
object that is citied, 
a dataset, database, 
map, sound file website 
uk data service recommends using 
a title that indicates subject matter, 
geography 
time period that data covers 
lets take a look an example 
citing data makes sense to try 
adopt style 
order references works 
bibliographic style guides 
reference management software may help 
inevitably, 
judgment may called 
if so, err side caution, 
always provide information 
less to help users find data 
in case a dynamic database, 
that is continually updated, 
may near impossible to refer back 
to exact version that you used 
in circumstances always 
include a date download 
in life sciences common 
to include an accession number 
database name 
youre referencing sequence data 
you see this in 
examples screen 
so if youre using 
an unpublished data source 
informal data sharing 
is relatively common 
even if data unpublished, 
citation principles still applies 
if somebody shared data you, 
example, 
via an email attachment, you reference 
this a private communication 
lets take a look an example 
last least, good practice in 
data documentation citation 
contribute to reaching a better standard 
reproducibility research 
reproducibility is a fundamental 
principle scientific method
