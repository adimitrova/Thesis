in
2014
,
a
group
called
force11
issued
the
joint
declaration
on
data
citation
principles
.
this
has
been
endorsed
by
a
number
of
scientific
bodies
and
publishers
,
as
well
as
individuals
.
so
why
cite
data
?
by
providing
a
citation
for
your
data
,
you
make
it
easier
for
other
users
to
identify
and
acknowledge
it
.
data
citation
helps
promote
the
reproduce-ability
of
research
results
,
it
allows
us
to
track
the
usage
and
impact
of
data
and
it
provides
a
structure
by
which
we
can
recognize
and
reward
data
creators
.
so
whats
the
best
practice
in
citing
a
data
set
?
as
a
general
rule
of
thumb
you
want
to
make
sure
you
include
enough
information
for
another
use
to
be
able
to
locate
the
data
set
or
the
part
of
the
database
that
you
're
referring
to
.
datacite
,
an
international
standards
body
founded
in
2009
,
recommends
the
following
five
minimum
citation
elements
.
a
creator
,
a
year
of
publication
,
a
title
,
publisher
,
and
identifier
.
here
,
identifier
refers
to
any
persistent
id
which
uniquely
identifies
the
object
,
including
a
doi
or
even
a
url
,
though
this
may
be
less
persistent
.
two
additional
properties
which
may
be
added
are
version
and
resourcetype
.
resourcetype
refers
to
the
class
of
object
that
is
being
citied
,
such
as
a
dataset
,
database
,
map
,
sound
file
or
website
.
the
uk
data
service
recommends
using
a
title
that
indicates
the
subject
matter
,
geography
and
time
period
that
the
data
covers
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
an
example
.
when
citing
data
it
makes
sense
to
try
and
adopt
the
same
style
and
order
of
references
as
your
other
works
.
bibliographic
style
guides
and
reference
management
software
may
help
.
but
inevitably
,
some
judgment
may
be
called
for
.
if
so
,
err
on
the
side
of
caution
,
and
always
provide
more
information
than
less
to
help
the
users
find
the
data
.
in
the
case
of
a
dynamic
database
,
that
is
continually
updated
,
it
may
be
near
impossible
to
refer
back
to
the
exact
version
that
you
used
.
in
such
circumstances
always
include
a
date
of
download
.
in
the
life
sciences
it
's
common
to
include
an
accession
number
with
the
database
name
when
you
're
referencing
sequence
data
.
you
can
see
this
in
the
examples
on
screen
.
so
what
if
you
're
using
an
unpublished
data
source
?
informal
data
sharing
is
relatively
common
.
but
even
if
the
data
are
unpublished
,
the
citation
principles
still
applies
.
if
somebody
shared
data
with
you
,
for
example
,
via
an
email
attachment
,
you
can
reference
this
as
a
private
communication
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
an
example
.
last
but
not
least
,
good
practice
in
data
documentation
and
citation
can
contribute
to
reaching
a
better
standard
of
reproducibility
of
research
.
reproducibility
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
scientific
method
.
so
you
've
now
completed
this
module
.
if
you
take
a
look
in
the
further
reading
section
you
'll
find
additional
references
to
get
more
information
on
documentation
and
citation
.
you
can
also
move
onto
the
next
module
,
which
is
on
storage
and
security
.
