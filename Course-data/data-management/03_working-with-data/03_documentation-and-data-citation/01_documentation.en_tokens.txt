in
this
module
,
you
'll
be
introduced
to
the
concepts
of
documentation
and
data
citation
.
by
the
end
of
the
module
,
you
'll
understand
why
documentation
is
important
,
and
how
and
when
to
use
metadata
.
you
'll
also
understand
the
relevance
of
data
citation
,
and
will
learn
how
to
do
this
.
so
why
document
your
data
?
by
documenting
your
data
systematically
,
you
'll
first
and
foremost
help
yourself
.
you
may
be
very
familiar
with
your
data
when
you
're
first
creating
it
.
but
the
chances
that
you
'll
remember
what
all
of
the
variables
and
abbreviations
mean
in
several
months
or
years
are
slim
.
the
importance
of
documenting
your
data
while
you
're
creating
and
analyzing
it
,
and
everything
is
still
fresh
in
your
mind
,
ca
n't
be
overestimated
.
others
will
also
need
good
documentation
to
understand
your
work
.
this
is
particularly
important
if
they
're
going
to
review
your
publications
,
try
and
validate
your
research
findings
,
or
even
use
your
data
in
new
studies
.
some
examples
of
data
documentation
are
lab
notebooks
and
experimental
protocols
,
questionnaires
,
codebooks
,
data
dictionaries
,
software
syntax
and
output
files
.
information
about
your
equipment
settings
and
calibration
,
database
schema
,
methodology
reports
,
and
provenance
information
.
laboratory
notebooks
are
crucial
documents
to
be
properly
managed
.
they
can
help
in
asserting
intellectual
property
rights
,
and
can
even
help
you
defend
against
claims
of
scientific
fraud
.
in
less
extreme
circumstances
,
they
can
demonstrate
adherence
with
standards
of
good
practice
and
ethical
integrity
,
and
show
compliance
with
any
contractual
obligations
.
routine
documentation
of
all
lab
work
is
an
important
responsibility
of
laboratory
researchers
.
there
are
three
levels
of
data
documentation
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
them
one
by
one
.
so
first
up
we
have
project
level
documentation
.
here
you
want
to
document
what
the
study
set
out
to
do
,
what
the
research
questions
and
hypotheses
were
,
and
what
methodologies
,
sampling
frames
,
instruments
,
or
measures
were
used
.
this
information
may
be
included
in
your
theses
,
your
published
articles
,
data
papers
or
technical
reports
.
second
,
we
have
file
or
database
level
documentation
.
a
,
you
should
document
,
how
all
of
the
files
that
make
up
the
dataset
relate
to
one
another
.
a
readme.txt
file
is
a
classic
way
of
doing
this
.
and
finally
,
we
have
variable
or
item
level
documentation
.
this
is
n't
just
defining
the
variable
names
at
the
top
of
the
spreadsheet
file
,
but
including
a
full
label
to
explain
the
meaning
of
that
variable
.
in
the
course
of
publishing
research
,
it
's
essential
to
cite
your
sources
.
the
reference
list
at
the
end
of
the
publication
shows
the
credibility
of
your
claims
and
also
the
prominence
of
a
particular
theory
or
school
of
thought
.
so
this
is
no
less
true
for
datasets
than
for
publications
,
but
somehow
the
practice
of
proper
data
citation
has
been
slow
to
take
root
in
academic
culture
.
all
too
often
we
see
very
basic
labels
and
charts
in
publications
,
such
as
source
:
oecd
,
without
any
proper
information
in
the
references
about
how
you
can
access
the
underlying
data
.
