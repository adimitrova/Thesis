music people often talk inverse 
trig functions 
thats nonsense 
trig functions arent invertible 
look y equals sine x 
sine sends different input values, like , 
pi, pi, pi, to output value 

so, you going to pick inverse 

to get around this problem, 
going to talk inverses trig 
functions we restrict domain 
here ive got a graph sine 
you see this function is 
invertible 
fails horizontal line test 
but, if i restrict domain sine to 
between minus pi , pie 
, this function is invertible 
and, heres inverse, arc sine 
convention, arc sine outputs angles 
between minus pi pi 
also convention, arc cosine outputs 
angles between pi 
arc tan outputs angles between minus 
pi pi 
note that im calling inverse trig 
functions arc whatever 
you know, arc cosine, arc sine 
one reason to call things arc cosine 
arc whatever, is radian 
measure 
if this is a unit circle, length 
this arc is measure 
this angle, in radians 
thats definition radians 
so, to say that theta is arc cosine 
half, is to say that theta is 
length arc whose cosine is half 
now, happens we compose 
inverse trig functions trig 
functions 
complicating matters thinking 
trig functions, lets think back to 
an easier example, square root 
squaring function 
like trig functions 
actually invertible, squaring 
functions invertible, 
multiple inputs yield output 
so we to define square root to 
pick nonnegative square root x 
that means that if x is bigger 
equal to zero, i square root 
x squared is equal to x 
if x is negative, this is true 
sort deal happens trig 
functions 
so if theta is between minus pi 
pi , acrc sine sin theta 
is equal to theta 
if thetas outside this range, this 
is case 
if thetas ouside this range, yes, arc 
sine is going to produce me, another 
angle, whose sine is angle 
theta 
theres plenty inputs to sine 
yield output 
things even complicated if you 
mix together different kinds trig 
functions 
example, sine arc tan x 
happens to equal to x divided 
square root plus x squared 
would you possibly get a formula 
like that 
well trick is to draw a right 
triangle, correct triangle 
well here ive drawn a right triangle 
ive got an angle theta 
ive drawn this triangle so that 
thetas tangent is x 
that means that theta is arc tangent 
x 
pythagorean theorem, i know 
hypotenuse this triangle length 
square root plus x squared 
that gives enough information to 
compute sine theta 
sine theta is this opposite side x, 
divided hypotenuse, square root 
plus x squared 
this tells that sine arc tan 
x must x square root plus 
x squared 
drawing pictures will get you far in 
understanding relationships 
i think basically impossible to 
memorize possible formulas that 
relate inverse trig trig functions 
if youre ever wondering 
formulas are, you draw 
appropriate picture, you 
figure right away
