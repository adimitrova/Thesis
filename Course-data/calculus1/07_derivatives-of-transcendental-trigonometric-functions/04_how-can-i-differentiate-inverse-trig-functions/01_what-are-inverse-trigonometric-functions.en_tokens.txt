people
often
talk
about
inverse
trig
functions
.
but
that
's
nonsense
.
the
trig
functions
are
n't
invertible
.
look
at
y
equals
sine
x.
sine
sends
different
input
values
,
like
0
,
pi
,
2
pi
,
3
pi
,
to
the
same
output
value
of
0.
so
,
how
are
you
going
to
pick
the
inverse
for
0
?
to
get
around
this
problem
,
we
're
only
going
to
talk
about
the
inverses
of
trig
functions
after
we
restrict
their
domain
.
here
i
've
got
a
graph
of
sine
.
and
you
can
see
this
function
is
not
invertible
.
it
fails
the
horizontal
line
test
.
but
,
if
i
restrict
the
domain
of
sine
to
just
be
between
minus
pi
over
2
,
and
pie
over
2
,
this
function
is
invertible
.
and
,
here
's
its
inverse
,
arc
sine
.
by
convention
,
arc
sine
outputs
angles
between
minus
pi
over
2
and
pi
over
2.
and
also
by
convention
,
arc
cosine
outputs
angles
between
0
and
pi
.
and
arc
tan
outputs
angles
between
minus
pi
over
2
and
pi
over
2.
note
that
i
'm
calling
these
inverse
trig
functions
arc
whatever
.
you
know
,
arc
cosine
,
arc
sine
.
one
reason
to
call
these
things
arc
cosine
or
arc
whatever
,
is
because
of
radian
measure
.
if
this
is
a
unit
circle
,
then
the
length
of
this
arc
is
the
same
as
the
measure
of
this
angle
,
in
radians
.
that
's
the
definition
of
radians
.
so
,
to
say
that
theta
is
arc
cosine
1
half
,
is
just
to
say
that
theta
is
the
length
of
the
arc
whose
cosine
is
1
half
.
now
,
what
happens
when
we
compose
the
inverse
trig
functions
with
trig
functions
?
before
complicating
matters
by
thinking
about
trig
functions
,
let
's
think
back
to
an
easier
example
,
the
square
root
and
the
squaring
function
.
and
just
like
trig
functions
are
not
actually
invertible
,
the
squaring
function
's
not
invertible
,
because
multiple
inputs
yield
the
same
output
.
so
we
had
to
define
the
square
root
to
pick
the
non-negative
square
root
of
x.
and
that
means
that
if
x
is
bigger
than
or
equal
to
zero
,
then
i
have
the
square
root
of
x
squared
is
equal
to
x.
but
if
x
is
negative
,
this
is
not
true
.
the
same
sort
of
deal
happens
with
trig
functions
.
so
if
theta
is
between
minus
pi
over
2
and
pi
over
2
,
then
acrc
sine
of
sin
of
theta
is
equal
to
theta
.
but
if
theta
's
outside
of
this
range
,
this
is
not
the
case
.
if
theta
's
ouside
of
this
range
,
yes
,
arc
sine
is
going
to
produce
for
me
,
another
angle
,
whose
sine
is
the
same
as
the
angle
theta
.
but
there
's
plenty
of
other
inputs
to
sine
which
yield
the
same
output
.
things
are
even
more
complicated
if
you
mix
together
different
kinds
of
trig
functions
.
for
example
,
the
sine
of
arc
tan
of
x
happens
to
be
equal
to
x
divided
by
the
square
root
of
1
plus
x
squared
.
where
would
you
possibly
get
a
formula
like
that
?
well
the
trick
is
to
draw
a
right
triangle
,
the
correct
triangle
.
well
here
i
've
drawn
a
right
triangle
.
and
i
've
got
an
angle
theta
.
and
i
've
drawn
this
triangle
so
that
theta
's
tangent
is
x.
that
means
that
theta
is
the
arc
tangent
of
x.
now
by
the
pythagorean
theorem
,
i
know
the
hypotenuse
of
this
triangle
has
length
of
square
root
of
1
plus
x
squared
.
and
that
gives
me
enough
information
to
compute
the
sine
of
theta
.
the
sine
of
theta
is
this
opposite
side
x
,
divided
by
the
hypotenuse
,
the
square
root
of
1
plus
x
squared
.
this
tells
me
that
the
sine
of
arc
tan
of
x
must
be
x
over
the
square
root
of
1
plus
x
squared
.
drawing
pictures
will
get
you
very
far
in
understanding
all
of
these
relationships
.
i
think
it
's
basically
impossible
just
to
memorize
all
of
the
possible
formulas
that
relate
inverse
trig
and
trig
functions
.
but
if
you
're
ever
wondering
what
those
formulas
are
,
you
just
draw
the
appropriate
picture
,
and
then
you
can
figure
it
out
right
away
.
.
