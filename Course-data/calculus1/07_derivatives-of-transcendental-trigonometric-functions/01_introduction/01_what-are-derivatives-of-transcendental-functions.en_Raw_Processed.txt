we learned to differentiate 
a ton functions 
if we differentiate two functions, we 
differentiate sum 
we differentiate difference 
we differentiate polynomial 
if we differentiate two functions, we 
learned product 
quotient rule, so we differentiate 
product quotient 
weve also seen to differentiate e to 

x, we know to differentiate 
natural log 
there still functions that we 
cant differentiate 
we cant differentiate trig functions yet 
we dont yet know to differentiate 
sine cosine, that is task 
is derivative sine 
is derivative cosine 
we know derivatives, we will 
able to calculate, complicated 
expressions involving trig functions 
weve already learned change 
rule, 
lets us differentiate 
composition functions 
so if we figure 
derivative sine x is, 
derivative cosine x is, 
going to 
able to differentiate kinds 
complicated expressions
