we
have
learned
how
to
differentiate
just
a
ton
of
functions
.
if
we
can
differentiate
two
functions
,
we
can
differentiate
their
sum
.
we
can
differentiate
their
difference
.
we
can
differentiate
any
polynomial
.
if
we
can
differentiate
two
functions
,
we
learned
about
the
product
and
the
quotient
rule
,
so
we
can
differentiate
their
product
and
their
quotient
.
we
've
also
seen
how
to
differentiate
e
to
the
x
,
and
we
know
how
to
differentiate
natural
log
.
but
there
are
still
some
functions
that
we
ca
n't
differentiate
.
we
ca
n't
differentiate
trig
functions
yet
.
we
do
n't
yet
know
how
to
differentiate
sine
or
cosine
,
and
that
is
now
our
task
.
what
is
the
derivative
of
sine
?
what
is
the
derivative
of
cosine
?
once
we
know
those
derivatives
,
we
will
be
able
to
calculate
,
very
complicated
expressions
involving
trig
functions
.
because
we
've
already
learned
the
change
rule
,
which
lets
us
differentiate
the
composition
of
functions
.
so
if
we
can
just
figure
out
what
the
derivative
of
sine
of
x
is
,
and
what
the
derivative
of
cosine
of
x
is
,
then
we
're
going
to
be
able
to
differentiate
all
kinds
of
very
complicated
expressions
.
