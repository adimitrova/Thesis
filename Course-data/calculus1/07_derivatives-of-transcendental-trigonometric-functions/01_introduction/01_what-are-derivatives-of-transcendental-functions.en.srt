2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:09,640
We have learned how to differentiate just
a ton of functions.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,800
If we can differentiate two functions, we
can differentiate their sum.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,570
We can differentiate their difference.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,620
We can differentiate any polynomial.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,740
If we can differentiate two functions, we
learned about the product and

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,100
the quotient rule, so we can differentiate
their product and their quotient.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,790
We've also seen how to differentiate e to
the

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,410
x, and we know how to differentiate
natural log.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,110
But there are still some functions that we
can't differentiate.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,320
We can't differentiate trig functions yet.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,550
We don't yet know how to differentiate
sine or cosine, and that is now our task.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,340
What is the derivative of sine?

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,330
What is the derivative of cosine?

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,346
Once we know those derivatives, we will be

16
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:54,640
able to calculate, very complicated
expressions involving trig functions.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,380
Because we've already learned the change
rule,

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,690
which lets us differentiate the
composition of functions.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,906
So if we can just figure out what the
derivative of sine of x is, and what the

20
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:07,626
derivative of cosine of x is, then we're
going to

21
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:11,850
be able to differentiate all kinds of very
complicated expressions.
