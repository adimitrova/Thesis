music anyone compute sine 
i mean nowadays, people use computers 
caluculators 
mysterious force 
computational devices able to perform 
computations 
machine know sine one 
is equal to 
so, thats a good question 
we compute sine radian 
one way is to use a little bit 
calculus 
so, calculus tell us 
so lets let f equals sine x, 
derivative x is cosine x, value 
f is , sine , value 
derivative is , cosine is 
now, i use derivative to 
approximate functions value 
functions value near zero is 
functions value zero, plus much i 
would input by, times ratio 
output change to input change, 
derivative zero 
well given this, in specific case 
value function derivative is 
, that means functions value 
h, h small, is h 
that means that sine a small angle 
is close to that value 
lets actually use numbers 
so concretely, sine say nd is 
really close to nd 
now, in addition to this, weve also got a 
double angle formula 
double angle formula sine says 
that sine x is times sine x times 
cosine x 
you derive this formula angle 
sum formula sine 
sine x plus x gives you this 
alright 
another way to rewrite that a double angle 
formula is to write entirely in terms 
sine 
alright 
cosine is square root minus sine 
squared x 
well, long cosine is positive, 
this is true 
so, if im working a value x, 
cos sins positive, sin x 
is times sin x times square root 
minus sin squared x 
we put pieces together 
well, heres we 
i know that sin nd is close to 
nd nd is close to 
and, sin a number close to zero is 
that 
that number 
i use this doubleangle formula 
entirely in terms sign to get an 
approximate value sign th 
using approximate value sign 
nd 
then, i use this doubleangle formula 
to get an approximate value sign 
th, to get an approximate 
value sign th, to get 
an approximate value sign half, 
to get an approximate value 
sign 
is really quite close to actual 
value sine 
so, happened 
calculus told us that sine a small 
number, is close to that small number 
double angle formula let us transport 
that bit information around zero to 
points much away 
way to approximate sine
