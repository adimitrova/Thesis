sine is a periodic function 
you follow graph sine wiggles 
down, forever ever 
lets try to get a sense to this is 
case 
graph sine look like this 
is sine moving 
to get intuition this, lets 
first imagine a different situation 
lets suppose that velocity is equal to 
position 
and, i gotta imagine im starting here, 
i start moving, right 
im going to start moving slowly 
first, position increases, im 
going to moving faster faster, 
right 
position is larger larger, 
velocity becomes larger larger, 
makes position larger larger 
so if this is way world works, im 
bouncing around minus to like 
sine 
im thrown towards 
infinity 
we know that situation looks like 
if f is position time t, f 
prime t, derivative f is 
velocity time 
so saying that velocity equals position is 
saying ive got function whose 
derivative is equal to 
and, we know an example that 
f equals e to is one example 
a function 
so, to cook a different situation, 
lets imagine something a little bit 
different 
instead, suppose that in 
situation acceleration is 
negative position 
so that means that if im standing 
here, position is positive, im 
to right zero, acceleration 
is negative im pulled back 
towards zero 
then, i swing past toward zero, 
position is negative, so 
acceleration is positive, so im 
pulled back in direction 
thats kind producing this swinging 
back forth across 
this situation comes physically in 
real world 
if you attach a spring to ceiling, 
springs acceleration is proportional to 
negative displacement 
theres a function also that realizes this 
model 
to say that acceleration is negative 
position is is second derivative 
position, is acceleration, 
is negative function 
yeah, we know an example 
if f is sine t, derivative 
sin is cosine 
derivative cosine, is 
second derivative sine, is minus sine 

we know another function like 
this 
look if, if g is cosine t, g 
prime is minus sine 
then, g double prime t, second 
derivative cosine, is minus cosine 
t, derivative sine is 
cosine 
so cosine is another example a function 
whose second derivative is negative 

we know even functions like this 
instance, if f function 
f equals sine minus cosine 
well then, derivative f would 
times derivative sine, is 
cosine, minus times derivative 
cosine 
derivative cosine is minus 
sine 
so this is plus sine 
so thats derivative f 
second derivative f is 
derivative derivative 
thisll times derivative cosine 
is minus sin, plus derivative 
sin, is cosine 
so yeah, this is another example a 
function whose second derivative is 
negative 
if i take this function differentiate 
twice, i get negative original 
function 
so if you like, reason 
functions bouncing 
like this, is in every case, 
functions second derivative is negative 
value 
function is positive, second 
derivative is negative, pulling 
functions value is negative, 
second derivative is positive, pushing 
back 
so function bounces 
like this forever
