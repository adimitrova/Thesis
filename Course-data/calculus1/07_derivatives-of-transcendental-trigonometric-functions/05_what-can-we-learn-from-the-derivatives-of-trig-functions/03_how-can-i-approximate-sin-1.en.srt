00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,312
>> [music] How can anyone compute sine?
I mean nowadays, people use computers or

2
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:12,335
caluculators.
But by what mysterious force are these

3
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:18,039
computational devices able to perform
these computations?

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,155
How does the machine know what sine of one
is equal to?

5
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:27,027
So, that's a good question.
How do we compute sine of 1 radian?

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,226
One way is to use a little bit of
calculus.

7
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:35,551
So, what does calculus tell us?
So let's let f of equals sine x, and the

8
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:41,503
derivative of x is cosine x, the value of
f at 0 is 0, sine 00, and the value of the

9
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,825
derivative at 0 is 1, because cosine 0 is
1.

10
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:48,945
Now, I can use the derivative to
approximate the functions value.

11
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:53,361
The functions value near zero is the
functions value at zero, plus how much I

12
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:57,701
would be the input by, times the ratio of
output change to input change, the

13
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:02,452
derivative at zero.
Well given this, in our specific case the

14
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:09,152
value of function 0 and derivative at 0 is
1, and that means the functions value at

15
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:15,052
h, for h very small, is about h.
That means that sine of a very small angle

16
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:20,559
is very close to that same value.
Let's actually use some numbers.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,371
So very concretely, sine of say 1 32nd is
really close to 1 32nd.

18
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:32,046
Now, in addition to this, we've also got a
double angle formula.

19
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:38,624
The double angle formula for sine says
that sine of 2x is 2 times sine x times

20
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:43,227
cosine x.
You can derive this formula from the angle

21
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:47,825
sum formula for sine.
Sine of x plus x gives you this.

22
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:51,660
Alright.
Another way to rewrite that a double angle

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,239
formula is to write it entirely in terms
of sine.

24
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,896
Alright.
Cosine is the square root of 1 minus sine

25
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:02,715
squared x.
Well, as long as the cosine is positive,

26
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:06,199
this is true.
So, if I'm working with a value of x,

27
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:11,511
which cos sins positive, then sin of 2 x
is 2 times sin x times the square root of

28
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:15,311
1 minus sin squared x.
We can put these pieces together.

29
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:21,056
Well, here's what we do.
I know that sin of 1 32nd is very close to

30
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,049
1 32nd because 1 32nd is close to 0.
And, sin of a number close to zero is

31
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,121
about that.
That same number.

32
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,653
Then I can use this double-angle formula
entirely in terms of sign to get an

33
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,398
approximate value for sign of 1 16th by
using my approximate value for sign of 1

34
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:41,285
32nd.
Then, I can use this double-angle formula

35
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:46,046
again to get an approximate value for sign
of 1 18th, and again to get an approximate

36
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:50,531
value for sign of 1 4th, and again to get
an approximate value for sign of 1 half,

37
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,801
and then again to get an approximate value
of sign of 1.

38
00:02:53,801 --> 00:03:00,987
Which is really quite close to the actual
value of sine of 1.

39
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:06,726
So, what happened?
Calculus told us that sine of a small

40
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:15,052
number, is close to that small number.
The double angle formula let us transport

41
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:21,718
that bit of information around zero to
points much further away.

42
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:25,477
All the way to approximate sine of 1.
