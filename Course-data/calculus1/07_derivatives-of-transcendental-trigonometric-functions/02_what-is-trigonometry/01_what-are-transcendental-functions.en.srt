1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,482
, Welcome back to Calculus One. And
welcome to week six of our time together.

2
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:10,579
Can you believe that we've been at the
Calculus game for more than a month

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:15,905
already? And we've done a ton of stuff so
far. Way back at the beginning of the

4
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:21,566
course, we first met limits. We explored
what it meant to evaluate a function near,

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,385
but not at, a particular import point. And
once we have limits, we were able to

6
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:30,511
define the derivative. We explore how
wiggling the input to a function would

7
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:34,628
effect the function in some way. That
ratio given by the derivative. Then, we

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,897
spent a lot of time focusing on how to
actually compute the derivative. Alright?

9
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:43,427
We learned all these derivatives rules of
the product rule, and quotient rule last

10
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,907
with the chain rule for actually computing
derivative of functions. And this week is

11
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:52,683
no exception. We continue that proud
tradition of actually differentiating. But

12
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:57,061
in week six, we focus in on the
transcendental functions. What are

13
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:02,579
transcendental functions? Now, most of the
functions that we've been looking at thus

14
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:07,768
far are really algebraic functions.
They're, say, polynomials or rational

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,655
functions, roots. Transcendental functions
are functions that transcend algebra, like

16
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,652
e to the x, or log. Functions that we
couldn't have gotten to if all we had at

17
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:20,897
our disposal was algebra. Another great
example of transcendental functions are

18
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,520
sine, cosine, and tangent, the
trigonometric functions. And if your not

19
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:28,373
feeling super comfortable with trig
functions, no worries. We're going to

20
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:32,802
review trig functions this week, as well.
But by the end of this week, we're going

21
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:37,081
to know how to differentiate those trick
functions, and that sets us up for week

22
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:41,421
seven. And what happens in week seven?
Applications of the derivative. We're

23
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:45,589
spending a ton of time focusing on
techniques of differentiation, and next

24
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:49,857
week we'll see some applications. The pay
off is going to be huge. Just one more

25
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,272
week of calculations to get through, and
then we can see what all of this is used
