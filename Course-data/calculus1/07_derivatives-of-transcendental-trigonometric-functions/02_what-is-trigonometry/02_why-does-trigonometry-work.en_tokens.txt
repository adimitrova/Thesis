what
's
trigonometry
?
well
here
's
the
basic
idea
.
so
i
've
got
a
bunch
of
right
triangles
,
these
are
all
right
triangles
,
and
this
angle
is
the
same
in
all
of
them
,
but
they
're
all
different
sizes
.
so
the
side
lengths
are
all
different
but
the
ratios
between
the
corresponding
sides
are
the
same
.
what
do
i
mean
?
well
,
take
a
look
at
this
big
triangle
.
it
's
got
some
height
that
i
'll
label
in
,
in
orange
,
and
it
's
got
some
width
that
i
'll
label
in
blue
.
now
the
width
of
this
triangle
is
n't
the
same
as
this
triangle
,
is
n't
the
same
as
this
triangle
,
is
n't
the
same
as
this
small
triangle
.
and
the
height
of
this
triangle
is
different
than
the
heights
of
these
three
triangles
.
but
look
at
the
ratio
of
this
height
to
this
width
.
alright
,
here
's
the
height
,
here
's
the
width
,
and
if
i
double
the
width
,
width
.
it
's
a
little
bit
more
than
the
height
.
in
other
words
the
height
is
just
a
little
bit
less
than
the
twice
the
width
and
that
's
true
for
all
of
these
triangles
.
the
ratio
of
their
heights
to
their
widths
are
all
the
same
,
even
though
they
're
different
sizes
.
that
's
the
key
fact
that
makes
trigonometry
work
.
if
you
just
draw
some
random
right
triangle
with
given
angles
,
it
does
n't
really
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
ask
questions
about
the
side
lengths
,
it
really
depends
on
how
big
the
triangle
you
drew
.
but
it
does
make
sense
to
ask
questions
about
the
ratios
of
side
lengths
,
those
only
depend
on
the
angles
.
so
we
can
give
names
to
these
ratios
.
we
call
the
sine
of
theta
as
the
ratio
between
the
height
and
the
hypotenuse
.
so
if
you
like
,
the
opposite
side
and
hypotenuse
.
so
y
over
r
in
this
diagram
.
the
cosine
of
theta
is
the
ratio
between
the
adjacent
side
and
the
hypotenuse
of
the
right
triangle
.
it
's
x
over
r
in
this
picture
.
and
the
tangent
of
theta
.
that
's
the
opposite
side
over
the
adjacent
side
,
it
's
y
over
x
in
this
picture
because
the
sine
,
cosine
,
and
tangent
of
this
angle
theta
.
and
they
're
all
just
defined
in
terms
of
ratios
of
side
lengths
.
now
that
we
've
got
a
definition
of
sine
.
we
can
,
for
instance
,
calculate
sine
of
pi
over
5.
if
we
build
a
triangle
,
any
right
triangle
with
an
angle
of
measure
pi
over
5.
i
built
a
right
triangle
.
and
this
angle
is
pi
over
5.
i
can
use
my
little
ruler
to
measure
the
hypotenuse
.
the
hypotenuse
here
is
about
25.2
centimeters
.
and
i
can
measure
the
opposite
side
,
and
the
opposite
side
's
about
14.8
centimetres
.
and
sine
is
the
opposite
side
over
the
hypotenuse
,
which
means
sine
of
pi
over
five
is
about
14.8.
over
25.2
,
which
is
about
0.59.
.
