music whats trigonometry 
well heres basic idea 
so ive got a bunch right triangles, 
right triangles, this 
angle is in them, 
theyre different sizes 
so side lengths different 
ratios between corresponding sides 

i mean 
well, take a look this big triangle 
got height that ill label in, 
in orange, got width that 
ill label in blue 
width this triangle isnt 
this triangle, isnt 
this triangle, isnt this 
small triangle 
height this triangle is 
different heights three 
triangles 
look ratio this height to 
this width 
alright, heres height, heres 
width, if i double width, width 
a little bit height 
in words height is a little 
bit less twice width 
thats true triangles 
ratio heights to widths 
same, even though theyre 
different sizes 
thats key fact that makes 
trigonometry work 
if you draw random right 
triangle given angles, doesnt 
really make a lot sense to ask 
questions side lengths, 
really depends big triangle you 
drew 
make sense to ask questions 
ratios side lengths, 
depend angles 
so we give names to ratios 
we call sine theta ratio 
between height hypotenuse 
so if you like, opposite side 
hypotenuse 
so y r in this diagram 
cosine theta is ratio between 
adjacent side hypotenuse 
right triangle 
x r in this picture 
tangent theta 
thats opposite side adjacent 
side, y x in this picture 
sine, cosine, tangent 
this angle theta 
theyre defined in terms 
ratios side lengths 
that weve got a definition sine 
we can, instance, calculate sine pi 

if we build a triangle, right triangle 
an angle measure pi 
i built a right triangle 
this angle is pi 
i use little ruler to measure 
hypotenuse 
hypotenuse here is 
centimeters 
i measure opposite side, 
opposite sides 
centimetres 
sine is opposite side 
hypotenuse, means sine pi 
five is 
, is
