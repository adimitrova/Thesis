music so we know sine cosine 
funny trig 
functions 
so maybe we already know sine 
cosine, we saw tangent already 
tangent could defined in terms 
sine cosine sine theta cosine 
theta 
cosecant is defined to sine 
theta 
secant is cosine theta 
cotangent is tangent theta 
whats so special functions 
i mean wed a function called 
cosecant if sine theta 
dont we always try sine 
theta 
that matter even a function 
called tangent if you compute tangent 
in terms sines cosines 
doesnt seeming like we need 
functions 
to make matters worse, theres even 
functions that practically one knows 
anymore 
in addition to these, theres 
haversine function is defined 
to sine squared angle 
i mean you really dont need haversine 
youve got sine 
considering that functions 
defined in terms ones, 
reason studying, you know, 
trig functions isnt really mathematical 
you dont really need cosecant if youve 
got sine 
reason emphasizing trig 
functions is cultural 
functions that people 
likely to see open 
technical manual knowing 
functions sometimes give you right 
intuition to attack a problem 
sine cosine legs a 
right triangle angle theta 
hypotenuse length 
pythagorean theorem we get this that sine 
squared plus cosine squared is equal to 
if you believe this identity you 
could divide this identity cosine 
squared you get sine squared cosine 
squared plus cosine squared cosine 
squared is cosine squared 
weve got 
functions i could rewrite sine squared 
cosine squared tangent squared, 
cosine cosine is , cosine 
squared is secant squared 
this is maybe an example 
knowing functions 
helpful 
a little bit easier to internalize 
this identity, i mean if you walk around 
you happen to notice that secant 
squared you think always going to 
place tangent squared plus 
say trying to internalize this middle 
identity 
this also a lovely geometric picture that 
kind a sells you an idea that 
trig functions special role 
example, here is a unit circle 
ive drawn an angle measure theta 
we know lengths in this 
picture 
this length across bottom here is 
cosine theta 
this length here, height that 
right triangle is sine theta 
turns that trig 
functions also encoded in lengths 
relevant lines in this diagram 
instance this line here length 
tangent theta this line between 
point y axis length cotangent 
theta 
if you measure bottom here 
length origin to this 
tangent line crosses that length 
secant theta 
and, if we measure here, 
origin to that tangent line crosses 
y axis, that segment length 
cosecant theta 
so you put functions 
weve got cosine sine weve also 
got visibly cotangent, tangent, 
secant, cosecant 
secant is measuring you know 
something thats crossing circle 
tangent is really measuring length 
part this tangent line 
if we take this picture we go 
fader you wont get idea 
trig functions vary together 
instance by, looking this 
picture theta moving you get a 
sense functions moving 
together 
instance, tangent secant 
moving together right tangent is 
really big, secant is really big 
conversely cotangent is really 
small, cosecant is you know small, close 
to 
use idea to tangent 
is called tangent 
is sine called sine 
so sine comes this latin word sinus, 
you know, like thing in nose 
like a opening, if like that 
an inaudible device you remember 
that sine is measuring this side 
right triangle you imagine 
right triangle sort opens in that 
side
