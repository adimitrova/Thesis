,
welcome
back
to
calculus
one
.
and
welcome
to
week
six
of
our
time
together
.
can
you
believe
that
we
've
been
at
the
calculus
game
for
more
than
a
month
already
?
and
we
've
done
a
ton
of
stuff
so
far
.
way
back
at
the
beginning
of
the
course
,
we
first
met
limits
.
we
explored
what
it
meant
to
evaluate
a
function
near
,
but
not
at
,
a
particular
import
point
.
and
once
we
have
limits
,
we
were
able
to
define
the
derivative
.
we
explore
how
wiggling
the
input
to
a
function
would
effect
the
function
in
some
way
.
that
ratio
given
by
the
derivative
.
then
,
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
focusing
on
how
to
actually
compute
the
derivative
.
alright
?
we
learned
all
these
derivatives
rules
of
the
product
rule
,
and
quotient
rule
last
with
the
chain
rule
for
actually
computing
derivative
of
functions
.
and
this
week
is
no
exception
.
we
continue
that
proud
tradition
of
actually
differentiating
.
but
in
week
six
,
we
focus
in
on
the
transcendental
functions
.
what
are
transcendental
functions
?
now
,
most
of
the
functions
that
we
've
been
looking
at
thus
far
are
really
algebraic
functions
.
they
're
,
say
,
polynomials
or
rational
functions
,
roots
.
transcendental
functions
are
functions
that
transcend
algebra
,
like
e
to
the
x
,
or
log
.
functions
that
we
could
n't
have
gotten
to
if
all
we
had
at
our
disposal
was
algebra
.
another
great
example
of
transcendental
functions
are
sine
,
cosine
,
and
tangent
,
the
trigonometric
functions
.
and
if
your
not
feeling
super
comfortable
with
trig
functions
,
no
worries
.
we
're
going
to
review
trig
functions
this
week
,
as
well
.
but
by
the
end
of
this
week
,
we
're
going
to
know
how
to
differentiate
those
trick
functions
,
and
that
sets
us
up
for
week
seven
.
and
what
happens
in
week
seven
?
applications
of
the
derivative
.
we
're
spending
a
ton
of
time
focusing
on
techniques
of
differentiation
,
and
next
week
we
'll
see
some
applications
.
the
pay
off
is
going
to
be
huge
.
just
one
more
week
of
calculations
to
get
through
,
and
then
we
can
see
what
all
of
this
is
used
