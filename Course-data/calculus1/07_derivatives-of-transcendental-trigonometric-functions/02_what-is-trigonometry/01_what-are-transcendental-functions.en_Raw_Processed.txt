, welcome back to calculus one 
welcome to week six time together 
you believe that weve 
calculus game a month 
already weve done a ton stuff so 
far way back beginning 
course, we first met limits we explored 
meant to evaluate a function near, 
at, a particular import point 
we limits, we able to 
define derivative we explore 
wiggling input to a function would 
effect function in way that 
ratio given derivative then, we 
spent a lot time focusing to 
actually compute derivative alright 
we learned derivatives rules 
product rule, quotient rule last 
chain rule actually computing 
derivative functions this week is 
exception we continue that proud 
tradition actually differentiating 
in week six, we focus in 
transcendental functions 
transcendental functions now, 
functions that weve looking thus 
far really algebraic functions 
theyre, say, polynomials rational 
functions, roots transcendental functions 
functions that transcend algebra, like 
e to x, log functions that we 
couldnt gotten to if we 
disposal algebra another great 
example transcendental functions 
sine, cosine, tangent, 
trigonometric functions if 
feeling super comfortable trig 
functions, worries going to 
review trig functions this week, well 
end this week, going 
to know to differentiate trick 
functions, that sets us week 
seven happens in week seven 
applications derivative 
spending a ton time focusing 
techniques differentiation, next 
week well see applications pay 
is going to huge one 
week calculations to get through, 
we see this is used
