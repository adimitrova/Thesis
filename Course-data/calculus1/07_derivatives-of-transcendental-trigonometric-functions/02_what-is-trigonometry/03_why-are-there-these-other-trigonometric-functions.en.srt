1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,109
[music] So we know about sine and cosine
but what about all those other funny trig

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,028
functions?
So maybe we already know about sine and

3
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:15,852
cosine, we saw tangent already too.
But tangent could be defined in terms of

4
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,538
sine and cosine as sine theta over cosine
theta.

5
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:23,253
Cosecant is just defined to be 1 over sine
theta.

6
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:28,512
Secant is 1 over cosine theta and
cotangent is 1 over tangent theta.

7
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:33,286
What's so special about those 6 functions?
I mean why we'd have a function called

8
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:37,813
cosecant if its just 1 over sine theta.
Why don't we always just try 1 over sine

9
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,692
theta.
For that matter why even have a function

10
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:44,776
called tangent if you can compute tangent
in terms of sines and cosines.

11
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:48,010
It doesn't seeming like we need all of
these functions.

12
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:53,483
To make matters worse, there's even other
functions that practically no one knows

13
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,567
about anymore.
In addition to these, there's the

14
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:01,352
haversine function which is just defined
to be sine squared of the angle over 2.

15
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,979
I mean you really don't need haversine
once you've got sine.

16
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,256
Considering that most of these functions
can be defined in terms of other ones, the

17
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:15,579
reason for studying, you know, these 6
trig functions isn't really mathematical.

18
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,823
You don't really need cosecant if you've
got sine.

19
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:22,715
The reason for emphasizing these 6 trig
functions is cultural.

20
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:27,101
These are the functions that people are
likely to see when they open some

21
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:32,284
technical manual and knowing about these
functions can sometimes give you the right

22
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:36,979
intuition for how to attack a problem.
Because sine and cosine are the legs of a

23
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,843
right triangle with angle theta and
hypotenuse length 1 just by the

24
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:45,797
Pythagorean theorem we get this that sine
squared plus cosine squared is equal to 1.

25
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:50,219
Now if you believe this identity and you
could divide this identity by cosine

26
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,911
squared you get sine squared over cosine
squared plus cosine squared over cosine

27
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:58,917
squared is 1 over cosine squared.
Now because we've got all these other

28
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:03,272
functions I could rewrite sine squared
over cosine squared as tangent squared,

29
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:07,071
cosine over cosine is 1, and 1 over cosine
squared is secant squared.

30
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:11,107
And this is maybe an example of how
knowing about the other functions can be

31
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,166
helpful.
Its a little bit easier to internalize

32
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,702
this identity, I mean if you walk around
and you happen to notice that secant

33
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:23,160
squared you can think always going to
place over tangent squared plus 1.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,445
Then say trying to internalize this middle
identity.

35
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:31,269
This also a lovely geometric picture that
kind a sells you on an idea that these 6

36
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:36,015
trig functions have some special role.
For example, here is a unit circle and

37
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:40,911
I've drawn an angle of measure theta and
we know what some of the lengths in this

38
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,880
picture are.
This length across the bottom here is

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,086
cosine theta.
And this length here, the height of that

40
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:51,049
right triangle is sine theta.
But it turns out that the other 4 trig

41
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:56,108
functions are also encoded in the lengths
of other relevant lines in this diagram.

42
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:03,594
For instance this line here has length
tangent theta and this line between the

43
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:07,960
point and the y axis has length cotangent
theta.

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:14,701
And if you measure on the bottom here the
length from the origin to where this

45
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:19,406
tangent line crosses that has length
secant theta.

46
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:25,286
And, if we measure over here, from the
origin to where that tangent line crosses

47
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:29,163
the y axis, that segment has length
cosecant theta.

48
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:34,251
So when you put all these functions down
we've got cosine and sine but we've also

49
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:38,261
got very visibly cotangent, tangent,
secant, and cosecant.

50
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:43,266
And the secant is measuring you know
something that's crossing the circle and

51
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:48,087
the tangent is really measuring the length
of part of this tangent line.

52
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:52,972
And if we take this picture and we go
fader you won't get idea of how all the

53
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:57,402
trig functions vary together.
For instance by, by looking at this

54
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:02,537
picture with theta moving you can get a
sense of how these functions are moving

55
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:05,807
together.
For instance, tangent and secant are

56
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:10,728
moving together right when tangent is
really big, secant is really big.

57
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:16,564
And conversely when cotangent is really
small, cosecant is you know small, close

58
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,600
to 1.
They can use some idea as to why tangent

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,613
is called tangent.
Why is sine called sine?

60
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:28,082
So sine comes from this Latin word sinus,
you know, like the thing in your nose.

61
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:35,617
It's like a opening, and if like that as
an [inaudible] device you can remember

62
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:43,782
that sine is measuring this side of the
right triangle because you can imagine the

63
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:48,062
right triangle sort of opens up in that
side.
