i
want
to
differentiate
tangent
theta
.
how
am
i
going
to
do
this
?
well
,
hopefully
you
remember
that
tangent
theta
is
sine
theta
over
cosine
theta
.
why
is
this
?
if
you
think
back
to
the
business
about
the
right
triangles
,
right
,
sine
is
this
opposite
side
that
i
'm
calling
y
over
the
hypotenuse
.
and
cosine
is
this
adjacent
side
whose
length
i
'll
call
x
over
the
hypotenuse
.
i
'll
call
this
angle
theta
.
then
sine
theta
is
y
over
r
,
and
cosine
theta
is
x
over
r
,
so
this
fraction
can
be
simplified
to
y
over
x.
that
's
the
opposite
side
over
the
adjacent
side
.
that
's
tangent
of
theta
.
so
good
.
i
can
express
tangent
theta
as
sin
theta
over
cosine
theta
,
how
does
that
help
?
well
,
i
know
how
to
differentiate
sine
and
cosine
,
and
by
writing
tangent
this
way
,
tangents
now
a
quotient
,
so
i
can
use
the
.
quotient
rule
.
all
right
,
so
i
'll
use
the
quotient
rule
,
and
the
derivative
of
tangent
theta
is
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
,
which
is
cosine
,
times
the
der
,
denominator
,
which
is
just
cosine
,
minus
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
,
which
is
minus
sine
,
times
the
numerator
,
which
is
sine
.
and
this
whole
thing
is
over
the
denominator
squared
,
cosine
squared
theta
.
now
,
is
this
very
helpful
?
well
,
i
've
got
cosine
times
cosine
,
so
i
can
write
that
as
cosine
squared
theta
.
and
here
i
've
got
minus
negative
sine
theta
times
sine
theta
,
so
that
ends
up
being
plus
sine
squared
theta
.
and
the
whole
thing
is
still
being
divided
by
cosine
squared
theta
.
can
i
simplify
that
at
all
?
well
cosine
squared
plus
sine
squared
,
that
's
the
pythagorean
identity
.
that
's
just
one
.
so
i
can
replace
the
numerator
with
just
one
,
still
over
cosine
squared
theta
.
and
one
over
cosine
squared
theta
,
well
,
one
over
cosine
is
called
secant
,
so
this
is
really
secant
squared
theta
.
.
so
what
all
this
shows
is
the
derivative
of
tangent
theta
is
second
squared
theta
.
a
moment
ago
we
did
a
calculation
using
the
quotient
rule
to
see
that
the
derivative
of
tangent
theta
is
second
squared
theta
.
and
now
i
want
to
see
how
this
plays
out
in
some
concrete
example
to
get
a
,
a
real
sense
as
to
why
a
formula
like
this
is
true
.
so
here
's
a
couple
triangles
.
they
're
both
right
triangles
and
the
length
of
their
hypotenuse
is
the
same
.
this
angle
i
am
calling
alpha
,
let
's
this
be
a
little
bit
less
than
45
degree
.
and
this
angle
i
am
calling
beta
,
and
it
's
more
than
45
degrees
.
now
what
you
can
say
about
the
secant
of
alpha
and
the
secant
of
beta
?
you
know
,
the
secant
of
alpha
is
definitely
bigger
than
one
.
i
mean
,
what
's
the
secant
?
it
's
this
hypotenuse
length
divided
by
this
length
here
.
and
that
's
bigger
than
one
.
how
does
it
compare
to
beta
?
well
,
the
secant
of
beta
is
quite
a
bit
bigger
than
the
secant
of
alpha
,
and
why
is
that
?
well
,
the
secant
of
beta
is
this
length
here
,
the
hypotenuse
,
divided
by
this
width
,
but
this
triangle
is
quite
a
bit
narrower
than
this
triangle
.
so
the
secant
has
the
same
numerator
,
the
hypotenuse
,
the
same
length
,
but
the
denominator
here
is
quite
a
bit
smaller
,
and
if
the
denominator
's
a
lot
smaller
,
then
the
ratio
,
which
is
the
secant
,
is
quite
a
bit
bigger
.
some
of
the
secan
of
beta
is
bigger
than
the
secan
of
alpha
,
and
the
secan
of
alpha
is
bigger
than
one
.
and
that
means
that
secan
squared
alpha
is
also
bigger
than
one
.
and
secan
squared
alpha
is
less
than
secan
squared
beta
.
and
the
significance
of
that
is
right
here
,
the
derivative
of
tangent
theta
is
secan
squared
theta
.
so
what
does
this
mean
?
well
,
this
,
this
is
telling
me
how
wiggling
theta
affects
tangent
.
it
affects
it
like
a
factor
of
secant
squared
theta
.
so
in
this
example
,
where
secant
squared
beta
is
a
lot
bigger
than
secant
squared
alpha
,
the
effect
of
wiggling
beta
on
the
tangent
of
beta
should
be
a
lot
larger
than
the
effect
of
wiggling
alpha
on
the
tangent
of
alpha
.
and
you
can
see
that
.
let
me
draw
a
triangle
,
where
i
've
wiggled
the
angle
alpha
up
a
little
bit
.
i
've
made
it
a
little
bit
bigger
.
but
i
'm
going
to
make
the
same
hypotenuse
.
all
right
,
so
this
hypotenuse
length
is
the
same
as
this
length
,
but
i
've
made
the
angle
a
little
bit
bigger
.
and
how
is
the
tangent
of
the
slightly
larger
alpha
compared
to
the
tangent
of
alpha
.
well
,
the
tangent
of
the
slightly
larger
alpha
is
bigger
than
tangent
alpha
,
but
not
by
all
that
much
.
now
compare
that
to
when
i
wiggle
beta
up
by
the
same
amount
.
i
make
beta
a
little
bit
bigger
.
right
.
so
i
make
beta
a
little
bit
bigger
by
the
same
amount
that
i
made
alpha
larger
.
and
i
think
about
how
that
affects
the
tangent
of
beta
.
the
tangent
of
beta
is
this
height
divided
by
,
divided
by
this
width
.
and
you
can
think
about
it
,
i
mean
this
,
this
height
maybe
is
n't
increasing
a
whole
lot
.
but
the
width
of
this
triangle
is
getting
quite
a
bit
narrower
.
and
because
it
's
the
ratio
of
that
height
to
that
width
the
tangent
of
the
perturbed
value
of
beta
is
quite
a
bit
larger
than
the
tangent
of
beta
.
and
you
can
,
you
know
it
's
reflected
in
the
fact
the
secant
squared
beta
is
a
lot
larger
than
secant
squared
alpha
.
so
these
,
these
kind
of
facts
,
right
?
the
fact
that
the
derivative
of
tangent
is
secant
squared
theta
you
,
you
can
really
get
a
sense
for
why
these
things
might
be
true
by
thinking
about
triangles
and
how
wiggling
the
angle
will
affect
certain
ratios
of
sides
of
the
triangles
.
but
,
if
this
seems
a
little
too
abstract
we
can
kind
of
pull
back
a
little
bit
and
do
do
a
numeric
example
next
.
you
know
,
and
maybe
the
numerical
example
is
sort
of
another
way
to
see
a
formula
like
this
in
action
.
let
's
do
a
numerical
example
to
get
a
sense
as
to
what
you
might
do
with
the
fact
that
the
derivative
of
tangent
is
secen
squared
.
here
's
an
example
,
let
's
try
to
approximate
the
value
of
tangent
of
46
degrees
.
why
is
this
an
interesting
example
?
well
,
we
know
the
tangent
of
45
degrees
exactly
,
all
right
.
and
figure
that
out
by
looking
at
a
triangle
,
here
's
the
angle
,
45
degrees
,
a
right
triangle
,
because
the
an
,
angles
add
up
to
,
180
degrees
.
so
it
's
45
plus
90
plus
what
?
well
,
this
must
also
be
45.
it
's
an
isosceles
triangle
now
,
so
these
two
sides
are
the
same
.
a
tangent
is
the
ratio
of
this
side
to
this
side
because
they
are
equal
that
ratio
was
one
.
so
i
know
the
tangent
of
45
exactly
.
it
's
one
.
but
i
am
trying
to
figure
out
an
approximation
for
the
tangent
of
46
degrees
,
the
derivative
tells
me
how
wrigly
an
input
affects
the
output
,
so
i
can
use
this
fact
and
the
fact
that
i
know
the
derivative
to
try
to
approximate
the
tangent
of
46.
in
particular
the
tangent
of
46
degrees
is
the
tangent
of
45
plus
one
degree
.
and
here
you
can
see
how
i
am
perturbing
the
input
a
bit
.
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
derivative
would
tell
me
something
about
.
a
little
bit
of
bad
news
,
the
derivative
of
tangent
is
only
secant
squared
if
i
do
the
measurement
in
radians
.
if
i
convert
this
to
a
problem
in
radians
.
with
radians
,
says
the
tangent
of
pi/4
,
which
is
45
degrees
,
plus
with
one
degree
in
radians
,
is
pi/180
radians
,
right
?
this
is
what
i
want
to
compute
.
i
want
to
compute
the
tangent
of
pi/4
plus
pi/180
.
and
i
'll
do
that
with
approximation
using
the
derivative
.
so
according
to
the
derivative
this
is
about
the
tangent
of
pi
over
four
,
which
is
the
tangent
of
45
degrees
,
it
's
one
.
plus
the
derivative
of
pi
over
four
,
which
is
secant
squared
pi
over
four
.
times
how
much
i
wiggled
the
input
by
,
which
is
pi
over
180.
i
know
the
tangent
of
pi
over
four
.
it
's
one
.
what
's
the
secant
of
pi
over
four
squared
?
well
,
if
i
pretend
that
these
sides
have
length
one
,
by
the
pythagorean
theorem
,
this
side
must
have
length
square
root
of
two
.
the
secant
is
hypotenuse
over
this
width
.
so
the
secant
of
pi
over
four
is
square
root
of
two
.
so
secant
squared
pi
over
four
is
square
root
of
two
squared
,
which
is
two
times
pi
over
180.
now
if
you
know
an
approximation
for
pi
,
you
can
compute
two
times
pi
over
180
plus
one
.
and
this
is
approximately
1.0349
,
and
it
keeps
going
pi
's
irrational
.
and
this
is
not
so
far
off
of
the
actual
value
.
if
we
actually
compute
tangent
of
46
,
the
actual
value
is
about
1.0355
and
it
keeps
going
.
andÃ£ÂÃ
«
ÂÃ£ÂÃ¢Â
1
0355.
is
awfully
close
to
1.0349.
so
we
've
successfully
used
the
derivative
to
approximate
the
value
of
tangent
46
degrees
.
