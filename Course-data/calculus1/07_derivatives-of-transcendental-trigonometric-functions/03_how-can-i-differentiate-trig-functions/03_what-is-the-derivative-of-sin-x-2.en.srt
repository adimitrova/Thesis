00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,953
[music].
Let's combine the change rule and the

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:10,681
derivative of sign to differentiate a
slightly more complicated function.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,706
Let's try to differentiate sine of x
squared.

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:20,506
We can realize this function as the
composition of two functions.

5
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:26,428
I can write sine of x squared as the
composition of f and g, where f is the

6
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:30,365
sine function and g is the squaring
function.

7
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:35,015
Now, how do I differentiate a composition
of two functions?

8
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:39,940
I use the chain rule.
So I differentiate f and the derivative of

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,165
f is cosine x, where the derivative of
sine is cosine.

10
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:52,021
And the derivative of g is just 2x.
So now I want to differentiate the

11
00:00:52,021 --> 00:01:01,109
composition of f and g and that's by the
chain rule f prime of g of x times g prime

12
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,240
of x.
In this case, f prime is cosine, so it's

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,273
cosine of just g of x, which is x squared
times the derivative of g, which is 2 x.

14
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:19,555
So, the derivative of sine x squared with
respect to x, is cosine of x squared times

15
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:23,629
2x.
Honestly, this is a pretty neat example.

16
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:28,957
In magnitude, this function, sine of x
squared, is no bigger than 1.

17
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:33,471
And yet, what do we know about this
function's derivative?

18
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:39,056
Well, the derivative of sine of x squared
is cosine of x squared times 2x.

19
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,513
And that function can be as large as you
like.

20
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:48,564
You can make cosine of x squared times 2x
as big as you want, as long as you choose

21
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:52,870
x appropriately.
So what we have here is a function which

22
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,052
isn't very big.
The function's value is no bigger than 1

23
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:01,656
in magnitude, but the function's
derivative is very large.

24
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:06,080
And you can see that on the graph.
The values of this function really aren't

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,692
that large.
The values are all hugging zero.

26
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,345
But the derivative, the slope of the
tangent line is enormous.

27
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,284
Look over here.
If you imagine a tangent line, that

28
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:17,837
tangent line is going to have enormous
slope.

29
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,718
The derivative over here is going to be
very large.

30
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,932
In spite of the fact, that the actual
values of the function really aren't that

31
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:29,096
large.
This actually provides another lesson.

32
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:34,553
Just because 2 functions are nearby in
value, doesn't mean that their derivatives

33
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:39,750
are anything close to each other.
For instance, here is the graph of the

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,484
cosine function.
And here is the graph of a function sine

35
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:51,200
of x square over 10 plus cosine of x.
Since sine of x squared is between minus 1

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,462
and 1, this differs from the cosine by no
more than a tenth.

37
00:02:56,462 --> 00:03:02,230
And, yeah, you can see the graph is really
close to the graph of cosine and yet this

38
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,353
graph is way more wriggly.
Let's zoom in and we can see the same sort

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,799
of thing.
Here's a zoomed in copy of just a cosine

40
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,161
curve.
And here's what happens if you zoom in on

41
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:18,284
this other function.
And in terms of the value, this other

42
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:22,380
function really isn't different from
cosine very much.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,658
But in terms of derivative, this function
is totally different than cosine.

44
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:33,208
This function is super wiggly, so the
derivative of this function is enormous,

45
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:38,173
even though the derivative of cosine is no
bigger than 1 in magnitude.

46
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:42,499
If you think this is kind of an
interesting example, it's worth trying to

47
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:47,396
cook up an even more elaborate example.
Here's a very specific challenge for you.

48
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:52,154
Can you find a function that, just make
one up, so that your functions values and

49
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:56,906
magnitude are less than c, and your
functions derivative and magnitude is less

50
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,922
than c?
So I want a specific number c, so that no

51
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:04,947
matter what value of x you plug in, the
function's value there and the function's

52
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,869
derivative there is less than c in
magnitude.

53
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:12,685
But, I want that function to have second
derivative which can't be bounded by a

54
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:17,104
constant.
I want you to cook up a function so that,

55
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:22,495
yeah, the values of the first derivative
are bounded by c.

56
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:29,781
But the second derivative can be as big or
as negative as I'd like, by choosing x

57
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:35,934
appropriately.
Can you find a function like that?
