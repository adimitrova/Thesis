i want to differentiate tangent theta 
i going to this 
well, hopefully you remember that tangent 
theta is sine theta cosine theta 
is this 
if you think back to business 
right triangles, right, sine is this 
opposite side that im calling y 
hypotenuse 
cosine is this adjacent side whose 
length ill call x hypotenuse 
ill call this angle theta 
sine theta is y r, cosine 
theta is x r, so this fraction 
simplified to y x 
thats opposite side 
adjacent side 
thats tangent theta 
so good 
i express tangent theta sin theta 
cosine theta, that help 
well, i know to differentiate sine 
cosine, writing tangent this 
way, tangents a quotient, so i 
use 
quotient rule 
right, so ill use quotient rule, 
derivative tangent theta is 
derivative numerator, is 
cosine, times der, denominator, 
is cosine, minus derivative 
denominator, is minus sine, 
times numerator, is sine 
this whole thing is 
denominator squared, cosine squared 
theta 
now, is this helpful 
well, ive got cosine times cosine, so i 
write that cosine squared theta 
here ive got minus negative sine 
theta times sine theta, so that ends 
plus sine squared theta 
whole thing is still 
divided cosine squared theta 
i simplify that 
well cosine squared plus sine squared, 
thats pythagorean identity 
thats one 
so i replace numerator 
one, still cosine squared theta 
one cosine squared theta, well, 
one cosine is called secant, so this 
is really secant squared theta 
so this shows is derivative 
tangent theta is second squared theta 
a moment ago we a calculation using 
quotient rule to see that 
derivative tangent theta is second 
squared theta 
i want to see this plays 
in concrete example to get a, a real 
sense to a formula like this is 
true 
so heres a couple triangles 
theyre right triangles 
length hypotenuse is 
this angle i calling alpha, lets this 
a little bit less degree 
this angle i calling beta, 
degrees 
you say secant 
alpha secant beta 
you know, secant alpha is 
definitely bigger one 
i mean, whats secant 
this hypotenuse length divided 
this length here 
thats bigger one 
compare to beta 
well, secant beta is quite a bit 
bigger secant alpha, 
is that 
well, secant beta is this length 
here, hypotenuse, divided this 
width, this triangle is quite a bit 
narrower this triangle 
so secant numerator, 
hypotenuse, length, 
denominator here is quite a bit smaller, 
if denominators a lot smaller, 
ratio, is secant, is 
quite a bit bigger 
secan beta is bigger 
secan alpha, secan 
alpha is bigger one 
that means that secan squared alpha 
is also bigger one 
secan squared alpha is less 
secan squared beta 
significance that is right 
here, derivative tangent theta is 
secan squared theta 
so this mean 
well, this, this is telling 
wiggling theta affects tangent 
affects like a factor secant 
squared theta 
so in this example, secant squared 
beta is a lot bigger secant squared 
alpha, effect wiggling beta 
tangent beta a lot larger 
effect wiggling alpha 
tangent alpha 
you see that 
let draw a triangle, ive 
wiggled angle alpha a little bit 
ive made a little bit bigger 
im going to make 
hypotenuse 
right, so this hypotenuse length is 
this length, ive made 
angle a little bit bigger 
is tangent slightly 
larger alpha compared to tangent 
alpha 
well, tangent slightly larger 
alpha is bigger tangent alpha, 
that much 
compare that to i wiggle beta 
amount 
i make beta a little bit bigger 
right 
so i make beta a little bit bigger 
amount that i made alpha larger 
i think that affects 
tangent beta 
tangent beta is this height 
divided by, divided this width 
you think it, i mean this, 
this height maybe isnt increasing a 
whole lot 
width this triangle is getting 
quite a bit narrower 
ratio that height 
to that width tangent 
perturbed value beta is quite a bit 
larger tangent beta 
you can, you know reflected in 
fact secant squared beta is a lot 
larger secant squared alpha 
so these, kind facts, right 
fact that derivative tangent 
is secant squared theta you, you 
really get a sense things 
might true thinking triangles 
wiggling angle will affect 
certain ratios sides triangles 
but, if this seems a little abstract 
we kind pull back a little bit 
a numeric example next 
you know, maybe numerical example 
is sort another way to see a formula 
like this in action 
lets a numerical example to get a 
sense to you might 
fact that derivative tangent is 
secen squared 
heres an example, lets try to 
approximate value tangent 
degrees 
is this an interesting example 
well, we know tangent degrees 
exactly, right 
figure that looking a 
triangle, heres angle, degrees, a 
right triangle, an, angles 
add to, degrees 
so plus plus 
well, this must also 
an isosceles triangle now, so 
two sides 
a tangent is ratio this side to 
this side equal that 
ratio one 
so i know tangent exactly 
one 
i trying to figure an 
approximation tangent 
degrees, derivative tells 
wrigly an input affects output, so i 
use this fact fact that i 
know derivative to try to approximate 
tangent 
in particular tangent degrees 
is tangent plus one degree 
here you see i perturbing 
input a bit 
this is exactly derivative 
would tell something 
a little bit bad news, derivative 
tangent is secant squared if i 
measurement in radians 
if i convert this to a problem in 
radians 
radians, says tangent pi, 
is degrees, plus one degree 
in radians, is pi radians, right 
this is i want to compute 
i want to compute tangent pi 
plus pi 
ill that approximation using 
derivative 
so according to derivative this is 
tangent pi four, 
is tangent degrees, one 
plus derivative pi four, 
is secant squared pi four 
times much i wiggled input by, 
is pi 
i know tangent pi four 
one 
whats secant pi four 
squared 
well, if i pretend that sides 
length one, pythagorean theorem, 
this side must length square root 
two 
secant is hypotenuse this width 
so secant pi four is square 
root two 
so secant squared pi four is square 
root two squared, is two times 
pi 
if you know an approximation pi, 
you compute two times pi 
plus one 
this is approximately , 
keeps going pis irrational 
this is so far actual 
value 
if we actually compute tangent , 
actual value is keeps 
going 

is awfully close to so weve 
successfully used derivative to 
approximate value tangent 
degrees
