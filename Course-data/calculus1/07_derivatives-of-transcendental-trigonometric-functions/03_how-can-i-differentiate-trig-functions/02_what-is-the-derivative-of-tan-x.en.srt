1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,387
I want to differentiate tangent theta. 
How am I going to do this? 

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:18,415
Well, hopefully you remember that tangent 
theta is sine theta over cosine theta. 

3
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:22,396
Why is this? 
If you think back to the business about 

4
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:27,856
the right triangles, right, sine is this 
opposite side that I'm calling y over the 

5
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:31,226
hypotenuse. 
And cosine is this adjacent side whose 

6
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:35,675
length I'll call x over the hypotenuse. 
I'll call this angle theta. 

7
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:40,933
Then sine theta is y over r, and cosine 
theta is x over r, so this fraction can 

8
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:44,978
be simplified to y over x. 
That's the opposite side over the 

9
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,540
adjacent side. 
That's tangent of theta. 

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,200
So good. 
I can express Tangent theta as sin theta 

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,804
over cosine theta, how does that help? 
Well, I know how to differentiate sine 

12
00:00:56,804 --> 00:01:02,482
and cosine, and by writing tangent this 
way, tangents now a quotient, so I can 

13
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,351
use the. 
Quotient rule. 

14
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:11,527
All right, so I'll use the quotient rule, 
and the derivative of tangent theta is 

15
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:19,067
the derivative of the numerator, which is 
cosine, times the der, denominator, which 

16
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:25,879
is just cosine, minus the derivative of 
the denominator, which is minus sine, 

17
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:31,965
times the numerator, which is sine. 
And this whole thing is over the 

18
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:35,690
denominator squared, cosine squared 
theta. 

19
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,470
Now, is this very helpful? 
Well, I've got cosine times cosine, so I 

20
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,221
can write that as cosine squared theta. 
And here I've got minus negative sine 

21
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:51,375
theta times sine theta, so that ends up 
being plus sine squared theta. 

22
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:56,840
And the whole thing is still being 
divided by cosine squared theta. 

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,140
Can I simplify that at all? 
Well cosine squared plus sine squared, 

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,055
that's the Pythagorean identity. 
That's just one. 

25
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:12,335
So I can replace the numerator with just 
one, still over cosine squared theta. 

26
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:18,859
And one over cosine squared theta, well, 
one over cosine is called secant, so this 

27
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:22,040
is really secant squared theta. 
. 

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,486
So what all this shows is the derivative 
of tangent theta is second squared theta. 

29
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:32,402
A moment ago we did a calculation using 
the quotient rule to see that the 

30
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,856
derivative of tangent theta is second 
squared theta. 

31
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:41,302
And now I want to see how this plays out 
in some concrete example to get a, a real 

32
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,225
sense as to why a formula like this is 
true. 

33
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:48,609
So here's a couple triangles. 
They're both right triangles and the 

34
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,897
length of their hypotenuse is the same. 
This angle I am calling alpha, let's this 

35
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:58,200
be a little bit less than 45 degree. 
And this angle I am calling beta, and 

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,150
it's more than 45 degrees. 
Now what you can say about the Secant of 

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,545
alpha and the Secant of beta? 
You know, the Secant of alpha is 

38
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:10,063
definitely bigger than one. 
I mean, what's the Secant? 

39
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:13,853
It's this hypotenuse length divided by 
this length here. 

40
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:17,780
And that's bigger than one. 
How does it compare to beta? 

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,745
Well, the secant of beta is quite a bit 
bigger than the secant of alpha, and why 

42
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,700
is that? 
Well, the secant of beta is this length 

43
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,414
here, the hypotenuse, divided by this 
width, but this triangle is quite a bit 

44
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:34,751
narrower than this triangle. 
So the secant has the same numerator, the 

45
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,465
hypotenuse, the same length, but the 
denominator here is quite a bit smaller, 

46
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:44,305
and if the denominator's a lot smaller, 
then the ratio, which is the secant, is 

47
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:48,031
quite a bit bigger. 
Some of the secan of beta is bigger than 

48
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,798
the secan of alpha, and the secan of 
alpha is bigger than one. 

49
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,750
And that means that secan squared alpha 
is also bigger than one. 

50
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,208
And secan squared alpha is less than 
secan squared beta. 

51
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:04,025
And the significance of that is right 
here, the derivative of tangent theta is 

52
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,584
secan squared theta. 
So what does this mean? 

53
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:10,268
Well, this, this is telling me how 
wiggling theta affects tangent. 

54
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:13,261
It affects it like a factor of secant 
squared theta. 

55
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:17,924
So in this example, where secant squared 
beta is a lot bigger than secant squared 

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,529
alpha, the effect of wiggling beta on the 
tangent of beta should be a lot larger 

57
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,868
than the effect of wiggling alpha on the 
tangent of alpha. 

58
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:29,207
And you can see that. 
Let me draw a triangle, where I've 

59
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:33,410
wiggled the angle alpha up a little bit. 
I've made it a little bit bigger. 

60
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,216
But I'm going to make the same 
hypotenuse. 

61
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:41,360
All right, so this hypotenuse length is 
the same as this length, but I've made 

62
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,971
the angle a little bit bigger. 
And how is the tangent of the slightly 

63
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:49,044
larger alpha compared to the tangent of 
alpha. 

64
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:54,323
Well, the tangent of the slightly larger 
alpha is bigger than tangent alpha, but 

65
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:58,532
not by all that much. 
Now compare that to when I wiggle beta up 

66
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:02,880
by the same amount. 
I make beta a little bit bigger. 

67
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,664
Right. 
So I make beta a little bit bigger by the 

68
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:10,072
same amount that I made alpha larger. 
And I think about how that affects the 

69
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:12,994
tangent of beta. 
The tangent of beta is this height 

70
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:17,096
divided by, divided by this width. 
And you can think about it, I mean this, 

71
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,775
this height maybe isn't increasing a 
whole lot. 

72
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:23,364
But the width of this triangle is getting 
quite a bit narrower. 

73
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,638
And because it's the ratio of that height 
to that width the tangent of the 

74
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:31,684
perturbed value of beta is quite a bit 
larger than the tangent of beta. 

75
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:36,299
And you can, you know it's reflected in 
the fact the secant squared beta is a lot 

76
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:40,027
larger than secant squared alpha. 
So these, these kind of facts, right? 

77
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:44,039
The fact that the derivative of tangent 
is secant squared theta you, you can 

78
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,367
really get a sense for why these things 
might be true by thinking about triangles 

79
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:52,590
and how wiggling the angle will affect 
certain ratios of sides of the triangles. 

80
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,392
But, if this seems a little too abstract 
we can kind of pull back a little bit and 

81
00:05:57,392 --> 00:06:01,686
do do a numeric example next. 
You know, and maybe the numerical example 

82
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:05,075
is sort of another way to see a formula 
like this in action. 

83
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:09,595
Let's do a numerical example to get a 
sense as to what you might do with the 

84
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,590
fact that the derivative of tangent is 
secen squared. 

85
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,306
Here's an example, let's try to 
approximate the value of tangent of 46 

86
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:21,483
degrees. 
Why is this an interesting example? 

87
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:25,593
Well, we know the tangent of 45 degrees 
exactly, all right. 

88
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:31,001
And figure that out by looking at a 
triangle, here's the angle, 45 degrees, a 

89
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:35,471
right triangle, because the an, angles 
add up to, 180 degrees. 

90
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:39,437
So it's 45 plus 90 plus what? 
Well, this must also be 45. 

91
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:43,980
It's an isosceles triangle now, so these 
two sides are the same. 

92
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,705
A tangent is the ratio of this side to 
this side because they are equal that 

93
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:51,774
ratio was one. 
So I know the tangent of 45 exactly. 

94
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:54,351
It's one. 
But I am trying to figure out an 

95
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,770
approximation for the tangent of 46 
degrees, the derivative tells me how 

96
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,557
wrigly an input affects the output, so I 
can use this fact and the fact that I 

97
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:07,240
know the derivative to try to approximate 
the tangent of 46. 

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,566
In particular the tangent of 46 degrees 
is the tangent of 45 plus one degree. 

99
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:18,250
And here you can see how I am perturbing 
the input a bit. 

100
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,861
And this is exactly what the derivative 
would tell me something about. 

101
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:28,263
A little bit of bad news, the derivative 
of tangent is only secant squared if I do 

102
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:32,281
the measurement in radians. 
If I convert this to a problem in 

103
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,312
radians. 
With radians, says the tangent of pi/4, 

104
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:40,318
which is 45 degrees, plus with one degree 
in radians, is pi/180 radians, right? 

105
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:44,864
This is what I want to compute. 
I want to compute the tangent of pi/4 

106
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,421
plus pi/180. 
And I'll do that with approximation using 

107
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:52,506
the derivative. 
So according to the derivative this is 

108
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:58,700
about the tangent of pi over four, which 
is the tangent of 45 degrees, it's one. 

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,822
Plus the derivative of pi over four, 
which is secant squared pi over four. 

110
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:09,770
Times how much I wiggled the input by, 
which is pi over 180. 

111
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,005
I know the tangent of pi over four. 
It's one. 

112
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:16,094
What's the secant of pi over four 
squared? 

113
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:21,831
Well, if I pretend that these sides have 
length one, by the pythagorean theorem, 

114
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,214
this side must have length square root of 
two. 

115
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:31,171
The secant is hypotenuse over this width. 
So the secant of pi over four is square 

116
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:35,069
root of two. 
So secant squared pi over four is square 

117
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:39,380
root of two squared, which is two times 
pi over 180. 

118
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,118
Now if you know an approximation for pi, 
you can compute two times pi over 180 

119
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:49,746
plus one. 
And this is approximately 1.0349, 

120
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:57,684
and it keeps going Pi's irrational. 
And this is not so far off of the actual 

121
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:03,317
value. 
If we actually compute tangent of 46, the 

122
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:09,070
actual value is about 1.0355 and it keeps 
going. 

123
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:15,543
AndÂˇÂ 1 0355. 
is awfully close to 1.0349. So we've 

124
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:24,173
successfully used the derivative to 
approximate the value of tangent 46 

125
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,132
degrees.
