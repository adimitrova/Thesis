lets combine change rule 
derivative sign to differentiate a 
slightly complicated function 
lets try to differentiate sine x 
squared 
we realize this function 
composition two functions 
i write sine x squared 
composition f g, f is 
sine function g is squaring 
function 
now, i differentiate a composition 
two functions 
i use chain rule 
so i differentiate f derivative 
f is cosine x, derivative 
sine is cosine 
derivative g is x 
so i want to differentiate 
composition f g thats 
chain rule f prime g x times g prime 
x 
in this case, f prime is cosine, so 
cosine g x, is x squared 
times derivative g, is x 
so, derivative sine x squared 
respect to x, is cosine x squared times 
x 
honestly, this is a pretty neat example 
in magnitude, this function, sine x 
squared, is bigger 
yet, we know this 
functions derivative 
well, derivative sine x squared 
is cosine x squared times x 
that function large you 
like 
you make cosine x squared times x 
big you want, long you choose 
x appropriately 
so we here is a function 
isnt big 
functions value is bigger 
in magnitude, functions 
derivative is large 
you see that graph 
values this function really arent 
that large 
values hugging zero 
derivative, slope 
tangent line is enormous 
look here 
if you imagine a tangent line, that 
tangent line is going to enormous 
slope 
derivative here is going to 
large 
in spite fact, that actual 
values function really arent that 
large 
this actually provides another lesson 
functions nearby in 
value, doesnt mean that derivatives 
anything close to 
instance, here is graph 
cosine function 
here is graph a function sine 
x square plus cosine x 
since sine x squared is between minus 
, this differs cosine 
a tenth 
and, yeah, you see graph is really 
close to graph cosine yet this 
graph is way wriggly 
lets zoom in we see sort 
thing 
heres a zoomed in copy a cosine 
curve 
heres happens if you zoom in 
this function 
in terms value, this 
function really isnt different 
cosine much 
in terms derivative, this function 
is totally different cosine 
this function is super wiggly, so 
derivative this function is enormous, 
even though derivative cosine is 
bigger in magnitude 
if you think this is kind an 
interesting example, worth trying to 
cook an even elaborate example 
heres a specific challenge you 
you find a function that, make 
one up, so that functions values 
magnitude less c, 
functions derivative magnitude is less 
c 
so i want a specific number c, so that 
matter value x you plug in, 
functions value there functions 
derivative there is less c in 
magnitude 
but, i want that function to second 
derivative cant bounded a 
constant 
i want you to cook a function so that, 
yeah, values first derivative 
bounded c 
second derivative big 
negative id like, choosing x 
appropriately 
you find a function like that
