once, we believe that sine cosine 
important functions, theyre 
connection between angles lengths 
well, we want to apply usual 
calculus trick 
happens if i wiggle input to sine 
cosine 
you might think trigonometry 
something right triangles 
but, here, ive drawn a picture a 
circle you rephrase this stuff 
in terms geometry unit 
circle 
so this is unit circle 
length this radius is ive 
got a right triangle here this angle 
is theta 
that means this base here like cosine 
theta height this triangle is 
sine theta 
coordinates then, this point 
unit circle cosine theta sine theta 
now, lets make that angle a little 
bit bigger 
lets suppose that i make this angle 
a big bigger, instead thinking 
theta, im thinking an angle 
measure theta plus h that means 
this angle in between measure h 
well a little bit geometry to 
figure far that point moved i 
wiggled theta to theta plus h 
so lets think this point here 
lets draw tangent line to circle 
that particular point 
well, im going to draw a little tiny 
triangle, is heading in 
direction that that tangent line 
and, so that tangent to circle, 
hypotenuse that little tiny right 
triangle here in red will perpendicular 
to this line here 
i actually determine angles in 
that little, tiny right triangle 
so we go this big right triangle 
here, a triangle, 
this angle theta plus this angle in here 
plus this right angle to add to 
degrees 
ive also got a straight line here 
that means that this top angle plus this 
right angle plus this mystery angle must 
also add to degrees 
well, this plus this plus this is 
degrees 
this plus this, right angle, plus 
this mystery angle add to degrees 
that means that, that mystery angle 
that little tiny right triangle must also 
theta 
id also like to know length 
hypotenuse little tiny triangle 
radians save day 
so 
well, i want to know length this 
little piece arc 
else i know 
i know this is a unit circle 
i know this angle here is h in 
radians 
definition radiance means that 
this little length arc here length 
h 
now, lets put tiny right triangle back 
there 
im going to hypotenuse that 
little right triangle also h 
going to close enough, right, 
this little piece curved arch 
this straight line awfully close 
that i know length 
hypotenuse angles in that right 
triangle i use sine cosine to 
determine side lengths 
two sides 
so ive got a little tiny right triangle, 
hypotenuse h, that angle there is theta, 
that means that this vertical distance 
here is h times cosine theta 
horizontal distance that little 
tiny red triangle is h sine theta 
okay 
so much wiggling theta to 
theta plus h move point around 
circle 
so original point here angle 
theta coordinates cosine theta sine 
theta 
point here i got i 
wiggled theta to theta plus h, that 
point coordinates cosine theta plus h 
sine theta plus h 
so much wiggling theta to 
theta plus h move point 
well, if i use this little right triangle 
approximation, sine theta increased 
h cosign data, cosign data 
decreased h sine theta 
in a position to make a claim 
derivative 
in words, picture, we 
learned that sine theta plus h is 
sine theta plus h cosine theta 
cosine theta plus h is cosine 
theta minus h sine theta 
a result, we say something 
derivatives 
changing theta affect sine 
well, a factor cosine theta 
compared to input 
so derivative sine is cosine theta 
changing theta affect cosine 
well, a factor negative sine 
so derivative cosine is negative 
sine 
maybe you dont find this geometry 
convincing 
well, we could go back to definition 
derivative in terms limits 
calculate derivative sin directly 
so if i want to calculate derivative 
sin using limit definition 
derivative, well, derivative sine 
would limit h approaches 
sine theta plus h minus sine theta h 
trouble now, is that ive gotta 
somehow calculate sine theta plus h 
i that 
well, you might remember, theres an angle 
sum formula sine 
sine alpha plus beta is sine alpha 
cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta 
if i use this, replace alpha theta 
beta h, i get this 
sine theta plus h replaced 
sine theta cosine h plus cosine theta sine 
h 
so lets that 
so, derivative is limit h 
approaches zero of, instead sine theta 
plus h, sine theta times cosine h 
this first term, plus cosine theta sine h 
minus sine theta here this 
whole thing is divided h 
so, this is sine theta plus h minus sine 
theta h 
now, i simplify this a bit 
ive got a common factor sine theta, so 
i pull that 
this is limit h approaches zero, 
pull that common factor sine theta 
whats left is cosine h minus 
h plus, ive still got this term here, 
cosine theta sine h h 
ill write that cosine theta times sine 
h h 
right 
so this limit calculates derivative 
sine 
now, written a limit a sum, 
is a sum limits, provided 
limits exist 
so, i also note that sine theta 
cosine theta constants 
right, h is thing thats wiggling, so 
i pull constants 
limits well 
so im left is sine theta 
times limit h approaches 
cosine h minus h 
plus cosine theta times limit h 
approaches sine h h 
now, i calculate limits 
well, weve got to remember way back to 
we calculating limits a long, 
long time ago 
we calculate limits hand, 
using say, squeeze theorem 
happens that this first limit is 
equal to second limit is equal 
to 
so im left plus cosine theta 
so, this is a limit argument, back 
definition derivative that 
derivative sine is cosine 
so, regardless whether you think 
geometrically algebraically, 
derivative sine is cosine 
derivative cosine is minus sine 
now, you believe this, there is 
sort weird things you might notice, 
like if you differentiate sine a 
whole bunch times 
so derivative sine is cosine 
second derivative sine, is 
derivative derivative 
derivative cosine is 
minus sine 
third derivative sine is 
derivative second derivative 
derivative minus sine is minus 
cosine 
fourth derivative sine, well, 
thats derivative third 
derivative, is minus cosine 
derivative a cosine is minus 
sine 
so, derivative minus cosine is 
sine 
so fourth derivative sine is sine 
so thats kind interesting 
if you differentiate sine four times, you 
get back to 
we already know a function that if you 
differentiate once, spits 
again, e to x is 
derivative 
so sort a fun challenge, you might 
try to find a function f, so that if you 
differentiate twice, you get back 
original function, if you 
differentiate once, you dont get 
back original function 
if you this, you ask 
question even higher derivatives 
we know a function whose fourth derivative 
is itself, none earlier 
derivatives function 
you find a function whose third 
derivative is itself, first 
second derivatives arent original 
function 
thats a fun little game to play, anyway, 
a little challenge you to try to 
find a function
