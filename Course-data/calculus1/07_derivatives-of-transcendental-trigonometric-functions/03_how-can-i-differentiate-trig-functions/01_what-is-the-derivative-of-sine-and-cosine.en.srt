1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,084
[music].
Once, we believe that sine and cosine are

2
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:10,213
important functions, they're all about the
connection between angles and lengths.

3
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:14,465
Well, then we want to apply our usual
calculus trick.

4
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,602
What happens if I wiggle the input to sine
and cosine?

5
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:22,062
You might think about trigonometry as
being something about right triangles.

6
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:26,484
But, here, I've drawn a picture of a
circle and you can rephrase all this stuff

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,137
in terms of just geometry of the unit
circle.

8
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:32,830
So this is the unit circle.
The length of this radius is 1 and I've

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,827
got a right triangle here and this angle
is theta.

10
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:41,165
That means this base here has like cosine
theta and the height of this triangle is

11
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:44,698
sine theta.
The coordinates then, or this point on the

12
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:50,037
unit circle are cosine theta sine theta.
Now, let's make that angle just a little

13
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:53,691
bit bigger.
Let's suppose that I make this angle just

14
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:59,086
a big bigger, and instead of thinking
about theta, I'm thinking about an angle

15
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:04,266
of measure theta plus h and that means
this angle in between has measure h.

16
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:09,690
We'll do a little bit of geometry to
figure out how far that point moved when I

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,722
wiggled from theta to theta plus h.
So let's think about this point here and

18
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:21,660
let's draw the tangent line to the circle
at that particular point.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,602
Well, I'm going to draw a little tiny
triangle, which is heading in the

20
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:34,664
direction of that of that tangent line.
And, so that it's tangent to the circle,

21
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:41,524
the hypotenuse of that little tiny right
triangle here in red will be perpendicular

22
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:45,947
to this line here.
I can actually determine the angles in

23
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:51,362
that little, tiny right triangle.
So we go this big right triangle down

24
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:57,342
here, and just because its a triangle,
this angle theta plus this angle in here

25
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:01,321
plus this right angle have to add up to
180 degrees.

26
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:08,608
But I've also got a straight line here and
that means that this top angle plus this

27
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:14,687
right angle plus this mystery angle must
also add up to 180 degrees.

28
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:18,711
Well, this plus this plus this is 180
degrees.

29
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:24,999
And this plus this, same right angle, plus
this mystery angle add up to 180 degrees.

30
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:31,303
That means that, that mystery angle and
that little tiny right triangle must also

31
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:34,823
be theta.
I'd also like to know the length of the

32
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:39,503
hypotenuse of the little tiny triangle.
Radians save the day.

33
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:42,782
How so?
Well, I want to know the length of this

34
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:45,824
little piece of arc.
What else do I know?

35
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:50,357
I know this is a unit circle.
And I know this angle here is h in

36
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:54,199
radians.
And the definition of radiance means that

37
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,431
this little length of arc here has length
h.

38
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:01,516
Now, let's put my tiny right triangle back
there.

39
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:06,718
I'm going to have the hypotenuse of that
little right triangle also be h.

40
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:11,235
It's going to be close enough, right,
because this little piece of curved arch

41
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:15,651
and this straight line are awfully close.
Now that I know the length of the

42
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:20,124
hypotenuse and the angles in that right
triangle I can use sine and cosine to

43
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:23,138
determine the side lengths of the other
two sides.

44
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:28,720
So I've got a little tiny right triangle,
hypotenuse h, that angle there is theta,

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,746
and that means that this vertical distance
here is h times cosine theta.

46
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:39,881
And the horizontal distance of that little
tiny red triangle is h sine theta.

47
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,425
Okay.
So how much did wiggling from theta to

48
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:47,241
theta plus h move the point around the
circle?

49
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:52,597
So the original point here from angle
theta had coordinates cosine theta sine

50
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,645
theta.
And the point up here which I got when I

51
00:03:55,645 --> 00:04:01,057
wiggled theta up to theta plus h, that
point has coordinates cosine theta plus h

52
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:04,932
sine theta plus h.
So how much did wiggling from theta to

53
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:09,759
theta plus h move the point?
Well, if I use this little right triangle

54
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,624
as the approximation, sine theta increased
by about H cosign data, and cosign data

55
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:20,702
decreased by about h sine theta.
We're now in a position to make a claim

56
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:25,126
about the derivative.
In other words, from the picture, we

57
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:30,409
learned that sine theta plus h is about
sine theta plus h cosine theta.

58
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:34,780
And cosine theta plus h is about cosine
theta minus h sine theta.

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,052
And as a result, we can say something now
about the derivatives.

60
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:43,927
How does changing theta affect sine?
Well, about a factor of cosine theta

61
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:48,287
compared to the input.
So the derivative of sine is cosine theta.

62
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:53,830
And how does changing theta affect cosine?
Well, about a factor of negative sine.

63
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,453
So the derivative of cosine is negative
sine.

64
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,602
Maybe you don't find all this geometry
convincing.

65
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:04,207
Well, we could go back to the definition
of derivative in terms of limits and

66
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:09,357
calculate the derivative of sin directly.
So if I want to calculate the derivative

67
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:14,389
of sin using the limit definition of the
derivative, well, the derivative of sine

68
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,206
would be the limit as h approaches 0 of
sine theta plus h minus sine theta over h.

69
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:23,961
The trouble now, is that I've gotta
somehow calculate sine theta plus h.

70
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:27,983
How can I do that?
Well, you might remember, there's an angle

71
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:31,801
sum formula for sine.
Sine of alpha plus beta is sine alpha

72
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:37,242
cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta.
If I use this, but replace alpha by theta

73
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:42,432
and beta by h, I get this.
Sine of theta plus h can be replaced by

74
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:46,554
sine theta cosine h plus cosine theta sine
h.

75
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:51,303
So let's do that.
So, the derivative is the limit as h

76
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:58,699
approaches zero of, instead of sine theta
plus h, it's sine theta times cosine h.

77
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,849
This first term, plus cosine theta sine h
minus sine theta from up here and this

78
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,923
whole thing is divided by h.
So, this is sine theta plus h minus sine

79
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:16,271
theta all over h.
Now, I can simplify this a bit.

80
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:21,665
I've got a common factor of sine theta, so
I can pull that out.

81
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:29,129
This is the limit as h approaches zero,
pull out that common factor of sine theta.

82
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:36,553
What's left over is cosine h minus 1 over
h plus, I've still got this term here,

83
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:43,002
cosine theta sine h over h.
I'll write that as cosine theta times sine

84
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,684
h over h.
All right.

85
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,656
So this limit calculates the derivative of
sine.

86
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:52,398
Now, it's written as a limit of a sum,
which is a sum of the limits, provided the

87
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,617
limits exist.
So, I can also note that sine theta and

88
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:59,896
cosine theta are constants.
Right, h is the thing that's wiggling, so

89
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:03,117
I can pull those constants out of the
limits as well.

90
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:08,834
So what I'm left with is sine theta.
Times the limit as h approaches 0 of

91
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:14,741
cosine h minus 1 over h.
Plus cosine theta times the limit as h

92
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:21,297
approaches 0 of sine h over h.
Now, how do I calculate these limits?

93
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:29,123
Well, we've got to remember way back to
when we were calculating limits a long,

94
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:34,452
long time ago.
We can calculate these limits by hand,

95
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:41,032
using say, the squeeze theorem.
And it happens that this first limit is

96
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:45,000
equal to 0 and the second limit is equal
to 1.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,378
So I'm left with 0 plus cosine theta.
So, this is a limit argument, back from

98
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:56,686
the definition of derivative that the
derivative of sine is cosine.

99
00:07:56,686 --> 00:08:03,202
So, regardless of whether you think more
geometrically or more algebraically, the

100
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:08,922
derivative of sine is cosine and the
derivative of cosine is minus sine.

101
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:15,998
Now, once you believe this, there is some
sort of weird things you might notice,

102
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:21,222
like what if you differentiate sine a
whole bunch of times?

103
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:28,788
So the derivative of sine is cosine and
the second derivative of sine, is the

104
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:35,715
derivative of the derivative.
It's the derivative of cosine which is

105
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:41,031
minus sine.
And the third derivative of sine is the

106
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:49,416
derivative of the second derivative and
the derivative of minus sine is minus

107
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:53,891
cosine.
And the fourth derivative of sine, well,

108
00:08:53,891 --> 00:09:00,106
that's the derivative of the third
derivative, which is minus cosine.

109
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,019
And the derivative of a cosine is minus
sine.

110
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,788
So, the derivative of minus cosine is
sine.

111
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:12,423
So the fourth derivative of sine is sine.
So that's kind of interesting.

112
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:16,369
If you differentiate sine four times, you
get back to itself.

113
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:21,457
And we already know a function that if you
differentiate just once, it spits out

114
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:24,559
itself again, e to the x is its own
derivative.

115
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,326
So as sort of a fun challenge, you might
try to find a function f, so that if you

116
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,748
differentiate it twice, you get back the
original function, but if you

117
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:35,312
differentiate it only once, you don't get
back the original function.

118
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:41,146
And if you can do this, you can ask the
same question for even higher derivatives.

119
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:46,016
We know a function whose fourth derivative
is itself, but none of the earlier

120
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:50,742
derivatives are the function again.
Can you find a function whose third

121
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:56,102
derivative is itself, but the first and
second derivatives aren't the original

122
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:59,715
function?
That's a fun little game to play, anyway,

123
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:03,998
it's a little challenge for you to try to
find such a function.
