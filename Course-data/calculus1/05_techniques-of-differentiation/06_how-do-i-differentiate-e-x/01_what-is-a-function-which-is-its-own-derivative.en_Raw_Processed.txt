music until now, weve 
considering functions that you 
get starting variables 
numbers, combining using sums, 
products, quotients, differences 
so we write down, you know, functions 
like fxxxxx, this, 
x 
theres things in heaven 
earth that dreamt in rational 
functions 
instance, you imagine a function 
f, is derivative im 
looking a functions, that if i 
differentiate it, i get back 
now, if youre thinking cleverly, you 
might able to cook a function 
quickly 
if f is zero function 
if i differentiate zero function, 
differentiate a constant function, thats 
zero 
so this would an example function 
in deriviative 
but, thats a exciting example 
sound so lets try to think a 
nonzero function, is 
derivative 
might we try to find a function 
so to make this concrete, im looking 
a function f, so if i differentiate it, i 
get make sure that 
zero function lets this 
function output one if i plug in zero 
now, could i rig this function to 
correct derivative zero 
if derivative this function 
itself, derivative this function 
zero also one 
you think a function whose value 
zero is one whose derivative 
zero is one 
yes 
here is a function, fxx 
this functions value zero is one, 
this functions derivative zero is 
also one 
if derivative f is f, 
derivative derivative f is also 
derivative f, is also f 
so, second derivative must f 
well 
so, if this function is 
derivative, second derivative f 
would also equal to f 
now, specifically, point zero, 
that means second derivative 
function point zero would 
functions value zero 
equal to one 
is this functions second derivative 
zero equal to one 

if i differentiate this function twice, i 
get zero function, 
i fix this least to point 
zero if i add x, 
now, this functions derivative zero 
is one this functions second 
derivative zero is one 
since f is derivative, third 
derivative f must also f 
worries 
if thid derivative f is also equal 
to f, is a consequence 
derivative f equal to f 
that means third derivative f 
zero is equal to one, this things 
third derivative is zero 
if i add x, now, if i take 
third derivative this function 
plug in zero, i get one 
fourth derivative f must also 
f 
okay, yeah i gotta deal fourth 
derivative 
im space here, worries, 
ill get paper 
here, ive written a function whose 
value zero is one, whose derivative 
zero is one, whose second derivative 
zero is one, whose third derivative 
zero is one, whose fourth derivative 
zero is one 
you see, this is sort building 
closer closer to a function 
is derivative 
if i try to differentiate this function, 
i get well, derivative 
one is zero, derivative x is 
one, derivative x is x, 
derivative x, well, thats 
x, derivative x, 
well, thats x 
yeah, 
i mean, this function isnt 
derivative, 
things looking better better 
fifth derivative f must also 
equal to f 
okay, yeah 
fifth derivative 
ill add another term, 
x 
if you check, take fifth 
derivative this function, 
value zero is one 
ive written a function, 
so that if i take fifth derivative 
zero, 
i get one 
sixth derivative f must equal 
to f 
sixth derivative i room, 
here we, go 
here is a polynomial whose value first, 
second, third, fourth, fifth sixth 
derivative point zero one 
you see this is edging us a 
little bit closer still to a function 
is derivative, 
if i differentiate this function, 
yeah, one goes away, x gives 
one back, x, i 
differentiate that, gives x 
x, i differentiate that, gives 
x 
x, i differentiate that gives 
x 
x, i differentiate that, gives 
x x, i differentiate 
that, ive got x now, 
course, arent same, im 
better 
seventh derivative must equal to 
f 
to get seventh derivative zero to 
correct, ill add x 
eighth derivative, ill add 
x, 
ninth derivative, ill add 
x, 
okay, okay 
this is, isnt working 
really succeeding in writing 
a function is 
derivative 
lets introduce a new friend, number 
e to help us 
here is going to get to 
number e 
this limit, 
limit hh h approaches zero 
is , a little bit 
hand, this limit, 
limit three to h minus one 
h h approaches zero is a little 
bit one, 

if you think this a function that 
depends two three, you could 
define a function gx, right 
limit h approaches zero x to 
h minus one h in that case, 
this first statement, statement 
limit two to h minus one 
h, thats really saying that g is a 
bit less one 
and, this statement here, if you 
think this a function g, this 
statement is really saying that g is a 
bit 
now, if youre also willing to concede 
that this function g is continuous, 
is a huge assumption to make, 
lets suppose thats case 
if thats case, ive got a continuous 
function, lets say, if i plug in 
two, i get a value thats a little bit 
less one, 
if i plug in three, i get a value 
thats a little bit one 
well, intermediate value theorem, 
that would tell there must 
input so that output is exactly one 
im going to call that input e 
in words, e is number, so that 
limit ehh h approaches zero 
is equal to one, 
this number is blah, 
blah, blah 
lets consider function fxex 
so lets think this function 
fxex 
now, whats derivative this 
function well, definition, 
thats limit h approaches zero 
f x plus h minus f x h 
now, in this case f is ex, 
so this is limit h approaches zero 
e to x plus h minus e to x 
h 
this is e to x plus h minus e to 
x h, 
so i write this e to x times e 
to h 
this is limit h goes to zero 
e to x, e to h minus e to 
x h, 
ive got a common factor e to 
x 
so ill pull that common factor 
ive got limit h approaches zero 
e to x times e to h minus one 
h 
now, far h is concerned, e to x 
is a constant, 
this is limit a constant times 
something, 
so i pull that constant 
this is e to x time limit h 
goes to zero e to h minus one 
h 
i picked number e precisely, so 
that this limit eqal to one 
consequently, this is e to x 
times one, this is e to x 
look, 
ive got a function whose derivative is 
function 
weve done 
weve found a function is 
derivative 
derivative ex is ex 
ex is honestly different this 
polynomials rational functions 
we couldnt produced that number e 
without using a limit 
ex is function that calculus 
could provide us
