1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,209
[MUSIC] Up until now, we've been 
considering the functions that you can 

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:10,680
get by starting with variables and 
numbers, and combining them using sums, 

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,533
products, quotients, and differences. 
So we can write down, you know, functions 

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:21,442
like f(x)=x2+x/(x+1^)^10+x, all of this, 
-1/x. 

5
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:27,372
But there's more things in heaven and 
earth that are dreamt of in your rational 

6
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:31,582
functions. 
For instance, can you imagine a function 

7
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:37,137
f, which is its own derivative? I'm 
looking for a functions, that if I 

8
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:42,670
differentiate it, I get back itself. 
Now, if you're thinking cleverly, you 

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,006
might be able to cook up such a function 
very quickly. 

10
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:50,364
What if f is just the zero function? Or 
if I differentiate the zero function, 

11
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:53,255
differentiate a constant function, that's 
zero. 

12
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:57,072
So this would be an example of function 
in its own deriviative. 

13
00:00:57,072 --> 00:01:02,092
But, that's not a very exciting example. 
[SOUND] So let's try to think of a 

14
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,372
nonzero function, which is its own 
derivative. 

15
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:11,006
How might we try to find such a function? 
So to make this concrete, I'm looking for 

16
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:16,486
a function f, so if I differentiate it, I 
get itself and just make sure that it's 

17
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:21,972
not the zero function. Let's have this 
function output one if I plug in zero. 

18
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:27,617
Now, how could I rig this function to 
have the correct derivative at zero? 

19
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:33,497
If the derivative of this function 
itself, the derivative of this function 

20
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:38,282
at zero should also be one. 
Can you think of a function whose value 

21
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:41,412
at zero is one and whose derivative at 
zero is one? 

22
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:44,488
Yes. 
Here is a function, f(x)=1+x. 

23
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:50,315
This function's value with zero is one, 
and this function's derivative at zero is 

24
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:54,237
also one. 
But if the derivative of f is f, then the 

25
00:01:54,237 --> 00:02:00,490
derivative of the derivative of f is also 
the derivative of f, which is also f. 

26
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,252
So, the second derivative must be f as 
well. 

27
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:08,571
So, if this function is its own 
derivative, the second derivative of f 

28
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:12,031
would also be equal to f. 
Now, specifically, at the point zero, 

29
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,622
that means the second derivative of the 
function at the point zero would be the 

30
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:19,370
function's value with zero which should 
be equal to one. 

31
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,872
is this function's second derivative at 
zero equal to one? 

32
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:26,554
No. 
If I differentiate this function twice, I 

33
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:31,442
just get the zero function, 
but I can fix this at least to the point 

34
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:36,732
zero. If I add on x^/2, 
now, this function's derivative at zero 

35
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:41,378
is one and this function's second 
derivative at zero is one. 

36
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:47,939
Since f is its own derivative, the third 
derivative of f must also be f. 

37
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,506
No worries. 
If the thid derivative of f is also equal 

38
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:56,375
to f, which is a consequence of the 
derivative of f being equal to f. 

39
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,550
That means the third derivative of f at 
zero is equal to one, but this thing's 

40
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,128
third derivative is just zero. 
But if I add on x^3/6, now, if I take the 

41
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:09,328
third derivative of this function and 
plug in zero, I get out one. 

42
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:12,306
The fourth derivative of f must also be 
f. 

43
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:15,075
Okay, yeah. I gotta deal with the fourth 
derivative. 

44
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:18,408
I'm out of space here, but no worries, 
I'll just get more paper. 

45
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:22,694
Here, I've written down a function whose 
value at zero is one, whose derivative at 

46
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:26,864
zero is one, whose second derivative at 
zero is one, whose third derivative at 

47
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:29,658
zero is one, whose fourth derivative at 
zero is one. 

48
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,947
And you can see, this is sort of building 
me closer and closer to a function which 

49
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,566
is its own derivative. 
If I try to differentiate this function, 

50
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,371
what do I get? Well, the derivative of 
one is zero, but the derivative of x is 

51
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:47,389
one, and the derivative of x^2/2 is x, 
and the derivative of x^3/6, well, that's 

52
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,777
x^2/2, and the derivative of x^4/24, 
well, that's x^3/6. 

53
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,568
And yeah, 
I mean, this function isn't its own 

54
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,946
derivative, 
but things are looking better and better. 

55
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,195
But the fifth derivative of f must also 
be equal to f. 

56
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:03,367
Okay, yeah. 
The fifth derivative. 

57
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:06,090
I'll just add on another term, 
x^5/120. 

58
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,112
And if you check, take the fifth 
derivative now of this function, 

59
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,429
its value at zero is one. 
I've written down a function, 

60
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:16,362
so that if I take its fifth derivative at 
zero, 

61
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,314
I get one. 
The sixth derivative of f must be equal 

62
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:22,213
to f. 
The sixth derivative I am out of room, 

63
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:26,048
but here we, go. 
Here is a polynomial whose value first, 

64
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:31,334
second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth 
derivative at the point zero are all one. 

65
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:36,517
And you can see how this is edging us a 
little bit closer still to a function 

66
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:41,185
which is its own derivative, 
because if I differentiate this function, 

67
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:45,742
yeah, the one goes away, but the x gives 
me the one back, and the x^2/2, when I 

68
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:51,257
differentiate that, gives me the x. 
X^3/6, when I differentiate that, gives 

69
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,858
me x^2/2. 
X^4/24, when I differentiate that gives 

70
00:04:55,858 --> 00:05:00,602
me x^3/6. 
x^5/120, when I differentiate that, gives 

71
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:09,222
me x^4/24. X^6/720, when I differentiate 
that, I've got x^5/120. And now, of 

72
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,866
course, these aren't the same, but I'm 
doing better. 

73
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,086
The seventh derivative must be equal to 
f. 

74
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:19,982
To get the seventh derivative at zero to 
be correct, I'll add on x^7/5040. 

75
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:24,897
The eighth derivative, I'll add on 
x^8/40,320. 

76
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:29,722
The ninth derivative, I'll add on 
x^9/362,880. 

77
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:32,647
Okay, okay. 
This is, isn't working out. 

78
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:38,192
We're not really succeeding in writing 
down a function which is its own 

79
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:42,492
derivative. 
Let's introduce a new friend, the number 

80
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:46,977
e to help us. 
Here is how we're going to get to the 

81
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,567
number e. 
This limit, 

82
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:54,687
the limit of 2^h-1/h as h approaches zero 
is about 0.69, a little bit more. 

83
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,422
On the other hand, this limit, 
the limit of three to the h minus one 

84
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:02,712
over h as h approaches zero is a little 
bit more than one, 

85
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:07,211
it's about 1.099. 
If you think of this as a function that 

86
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:11,860
depends not on two or three, you could 
define a function g(x), right? 

87
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,811
The limit as h approaches zero of x to 
the h minus one over h. In that case, 

88
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,088
this first statement, the statement about 
the limit of two to the h minus one over 

89
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:23,192
h, that's really saying that g(2) is a 
bit less than one. 

90
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:27,119
And, this statement over here, and if you 
think of this as a function g, this 

91
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,123
statement is really saying that g(3) is a 
bit more than 1. 

92
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,260
Now, if you're also willing to concede 
that this function g is continuous, which 

93
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,631
is a huge assumption to make, 
but let's suppose that's the case. 

94
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,672
If that's the case, I've got a continuous 
function, let's say, and if I plug in 

95
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,188
two, I get a value that's a little bit 
less than one, 

96
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:47,842
and if I plug in three, I get a value 
that's a little bit more than one. 

97
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:54,194
Well, by the intermediate value theorem, 
that would tell me there must be some 

98
00:06:54,194 --> 00:07:00,116
input so that the output is exactly one. 
I'm going to call that input e. 

99
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:06,835
In other words, e is the number, so that 
the limit of e^h-1/h as h approaches zero 

100
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:11,235
is equal to one, 
and this number is about 2.7183 blah, 

101
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:16,583
blah, blah. 
Now lets consider the function f(x)=e^x. 

102
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,816
So let's think about this function 
f(x)=e^x. 

103
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:27,438
Now, what's the derivative of this 
function? Well, from the definition, 

104
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:31,309
that's the limit as h approaches zero of 
f of x plus h minus f of x over h. 

105
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:38,675
Now, in this case f is just e^x, 
so this is the limit as h approaches zero 

106
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,725
of e to the x plus h minus e to the x 
over h. 

107
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,662
And this is e to the x plus h minus e to 
the x over h, 

108
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:47,593
so I can write this as e to the x times e 
to the h. 

109
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:54,021
This is the limit then as h goes to zero 
of e to the x, e to the h minus e to the 

110
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,709
x over h, 
Now I've got a common factor of e to the 

111
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,679
x. 
So I'll pull out that common factor and 

112
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:05,081
I've got the limit as h approaches zero 
of e to the x times e to the h minus one 

113
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:08,330
over h. 
Now, as far as h is concerned, e to the x 

114
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,043
is a constant, 
and this is the limit of a constant times 

115
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:15,065
something, 
so I can pull that constant out. 

116
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:20,922
This is e to the x time the limit as h 
goes to zero of e to the h minus one over 

117
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:24,142
h. 
But I picked the number e precisely, so 

118
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:29,067
that this limit was eqal to one. 
And consequently, this is e to the x 

119
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,732
times one, this is just e to the x. 
Look, 

120
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:36,582
I've got a function whose derivative is 
the same function. 

121
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,032
We've done it. 
We've found a function which is its own 

122
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:43,772
derivative. 
The derivative of e^x is e^x. 

123
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:48,107
E^x is honestly different from this 
polynomials and rational functions. 

124
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:52,542
We couldn't have produced that number e 
without using a limit. 

125
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:56,165
E^x is the function that only calculus 
could provide us with.
