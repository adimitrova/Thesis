music youre lost 
youre trapped a desert island 
you to remember quotient rule 
you remember quotient rule 
even while trapped that desert island, 
youll remember vague form 
quotient rule 
youll remember, numerator looks a 
little bit like product rule 
a value times a derivative minus 
value times derivative 
but, you might remember exactly 
minus sign goes, 
right you dont know if 
fxgxgxf x, way 
around, gxfxfxgx 
one is if you werent trapped 
desert island, youd access 
to wikipedia 
you could look quotient 
rule 
music even if you could look 
lets think a little bit 
is quotient rule is to 
make easy lets suppose 
that f x is positive g x is 
positive 
im trying to understand 
derivative quotient is 
really is quotient changing 
f g changing 
lets make that really concrete 
lets suppose that numerator is 
getting bigger denominator is 
staying 
this change well that is 
bigger, right if you take bigger thing 
cut number 
pieces 
then, pieces bigger 
now, we could play game 
way 
i could keep pieces size, 
increase denominator would 
cutting pieces 
right if i take amount 
stuff divide pieces, 
pieces is smaller 
right so a size number divided a 
bigger number this fraction is 
smaller 
this relate to derivitaive 
well think back to sign, i g n 
derivative 
so set up, f x is positive, g 
x is positive, maybe denominator 
isnt really changing, numerator, 
is getting bigger i want to know, 
is fraction changing 
well, numerators getting bigger 
denominators staying same, 
fraction getting bigger, 
tells us something sign 
this derivative 
we similarly analyze situation 
involving denominator 
so, if numerator is positive 
denominator is positive numerator 
is really changing, 
denominator is getting bigger 
fraction f x g x is getting 
smaller 
so that tells us, again, something 
sign derivative this ratio 
negative, if 
denominators getting bigger, 
numerators really changing, this 
ratio is getting smaller 
this help us to identify 
actual quotient rule we get 
rid that imposter quotient rule 
so weve got to guesses to 
quotient rule might ive got 
information that we thought about, 
right if functions values 
positive numerators getting 
bigger denominators really 
changing that means fractions 
getting bigger 
if numerators really changing 
denominators getting bigger 
that fractions getting smaller 
truths 
truths compatible 
guesses 
quotient rule well, lets take a look 
this first guess quotient rule, 
lets see happens if numerators 
changing, denominators 
getting bigger 
if numerators changing, that 
kills this whole first term 
derivative f vanishes 
derivative that a nominator 
positive, im imagining value 
function is positive 
so, this is a positive number a 
negative sign there, so this is a 
negative numerator divided a positive 
number 
so, if this quotient rule, 
would telling us that an increasing 
denominator makes this ratio smaller 
makes derivative negative, 
thats good 
thats really compatible this 
picture 
now, is this compatible that well, 
would happen here if denominator 
increasing, numerator 
staying if numerators 
staying same, this is zero, 
kills this term 
im left this, 
if numerator is increasing 
this term is positive imagine 
functions unknown positive 
so you got a positive thing divided 
positive thing 
if quotient row, an 
increasing denominator 
numerator remains would make 
this ratio increase this 
derivative would positive this 
cant be, this isnt quotient rule, 
compatible this fact 
in fact, this is quotient rule we 
see that also compatible 
this first fact 
if numerator is getting bigger 
denominator is staying well 
denominator staying makes 
this term zero kills this whole 
term im left is this 
imagine g is positive 
derivative numerator is positive 
derivator is getting bigger 
this is positive, 
ive got a positive thing divided a 
positive thing 
that makes derivative positive 
that makes sense 
if numerators getting bigger 
denominators staying same, 
derivative is positive thats exactly 
this true quotient rule is saying 
fundamentally, i dont want you to 
memorize rules 
music i want you to understand 
rules 
i want you to get a feeling 
theres a negative sign in quotient 
rule 
really belongs there
