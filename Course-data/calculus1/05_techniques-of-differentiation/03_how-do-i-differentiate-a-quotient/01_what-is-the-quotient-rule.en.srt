00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,129
[MUSIC] Given what we've done so far we 
can differentiate a bunch of functions. 

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:10,530
We can differentiate sums and differences 
and products. 

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,491
But what about quotients. 
Given a fraction I'd like to be able to 

4
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:20,945
differentiate that fraction. 
I like to be able to differentiate a 

5
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:27,603
really complicated looking function like 
f(x)=2x+1/x^2+1, for instance. 

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:34,086
But we're stuck immediately because we 
don't have anyways to differentiate 

7
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:38,890
quotients, until now. 
Here's the The quotient rule so to state 

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,804
this really precisely let's suppose I got 
two functions f and g and then I define a 

9
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:46,692
new function that I'm just going to call 
h for now. 

10
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:51,137
H(x) is this quotient f(x) over g(x). 
Now I also want to make sure that the 

11
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:55,959
denominator isn't 0 at the point a so it 
makes sense to evaluate this function at 

12
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,964
the point a. 
And I want ot assume that f and g are 

13
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:02,877
differential at the point a. 
And I'm trying to understand how h 

14
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:07,674
changes so I'm going to need to know how 
f and g change when the input wiggles a 

15
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:10,364
bit. 
Alright so given all this set up, then I 

16
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:14,948
can tell you what the derivative of the 
quotient is, the derivative of the 

17
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:19,463
quotient at a is the denominator at a 
times the derivative of the numerator at 

18
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,182
a. 
Minus the numerator at a times the 

19
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:27,790
derivative of the denominator at a, all 
divided by the denominator at a^2. 

20
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,962
Let's use the quotient rule to 
differentiate the function that we saw 

21
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:36,656
earlier. 
So, the function we were thinking about 

22
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:41,138
is f(x)=2x+1/ x^2+1. 
I want to calculate the derivative of 

23
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:46,729
that, with respect to x. 
Now the derivative of this quotient is 

24
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,962
given to us by the quotient rule. 
It's just the denominator times the 

25
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:59,478
derivative of the numerator minus the 
numerator times the derivative of the 

26
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,678
denominator. 
That's all divided by the denominator 

27
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:07,528
squared. 
Now, I've calculated the derivative of 

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:13,741
this quotient in terms of the derivatives 
of the numerator and denominator. 

29
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:19,623
So we can simplify this further, 
X^2+1 times the derivative of this sum is 

30
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:24,172
the sum of the derivatives. 
It's the derivative of 2x + the 

31
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:30,530
derivative of 1-2x+1 times at again, the 
derivative of a sum, so the derivative of 

32
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,111
x^2, with respect to x plus the 
derivative of 1. 

33
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:39,762
And it's all divided by the denominator, 
the original denominator squared. 

34
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:43,701
I can keep going, 
I've got x^2+1 times what's the 

35
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:49,799
derivative of 2x? It's just 2. 
What's the derivative of this constant? 

36
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,711
zero, minus 2x+1 times, what's the 
derivative of x^2? It's 2x, 

37
00:02:54,711 --> 00:03:00,956
and what's the derivative of 1? It's the 
derivative of a constant zero, all 

38
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:04,623
divided by x^2+1^2. 
So, this is the derivative of the 

39
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:09,903
original function we're considering, 
there's no more differentiation to be 

40
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,848
done and we did it using the quotient 
rule. 

41
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:17,562
We've done a ton of work on 
differentiation so far, we differentiate 

42
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:20,790
sums, differences, products, now 
quotients. 

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,722
What sorts of functions can we 
differentiate using all of these rules? 

44
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,413
Well, here's one big collection. 
If you've got a polynomial divided by 

45
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,872
polynomial, these things are called 
rational functions. 

46
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:37,355
Sort of an analogy with rational numbers 
which are integers over integers. 

47
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:41,599
A polynomial over a polynomial is by 
analogy, being called a rational 

48
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,819
function. 
Now, since this is just a quotient of two 

49
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,811
things you can differentiate, you can 
differentiate these rational functions. 

50
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,862
This is a huge class of functions that 
you can now differentiate. 

51
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,587
[MUSIC] I encourage you to practice with 
the quotient rule. 

52
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:02,535
With some practice, you'll be able to 
differentiate any rational function that 

53
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,412
we can throw at you.
