00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,718
[MUSIC] You're lost. 
You're trapped on a desert island. 

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:08,936
You have to remember the quotient rule. 
How can you remember the quotient rule? 

3
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:14,129
Even while trapped on that desert island, 
you'll remember the vague form of the 

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,737
quotient rule. 
You'll remember, the numerator looks a 

5
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:22,638
little bit like the product rule. 
It's a value times a derivative minus the 

6
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:29,037
other value times the other derivative. 
But, you might not remember exactly where 

7
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:33,232
the minus sign goes, 
right? You don't know if it's 

8
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:40,972
f(x)*g(x)-g(x)*f (x), or the other way 
around, g(x)*f(x)-f(x)*g(x). 

9
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:50,302
Which one is it? If you weren't trapped 
on the desert island, you'd have access 

10
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:56,605
to Wikipedia. 
And you could just look up the quotient 

11
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:01,783
rule. 
[MUSIC] Even if you could just look it up 

12
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:07,962
let's think about it for a little bit. 
Why is the quotient rule what it is? To 

13
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:13,932
make it easy on ourselves let's suppose 
that f of x is positive and g of x is 

14
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:17,527
positive. 
Now I'm trying to understand some of the 

15
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:22,652
derivative of the quotient which is 
really how is the quotient changing when 

16
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:27,052
f and g are doing some changing. 
Let's make that really concrete. 

17
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:32,002
Let's suppose that the numerator is 
getting bigger but the denominator is 

18
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,852
staying the same. 
How does this change? Well then that is 

19
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:40,642
bigger, right? If you take Bigger thing 
and cut it into the same number of 

20
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,012
pieces. 
Then, those pieces are bigger. 

21
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:45,497
Now, we could play the game the other 
way. 

22
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:50,162
I could keep the pieces the same size, 
but increase the denominator which would 

23
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:54,422
be cutting them into more pieces. 
Right? And if I take the same amount of 

24
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,852
stuff and divide it into more pieces, 
then each of those pieces is smaller. 

25
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,282
Right? So a same size number divided by a 
bigger number now this fraction is 

26
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:07,566
smaller. 
How does this relate to the derivitaive? 

27
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:12,382
Well think back to the sign, the s i g n 
of the derivative. 

28
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:18,738
So same set up, f of x is positive, g of 
x is positive, maybe the denominator 

29
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:25,336
isn't really changing, but the numerator, 
is getting bigger And now I want to know, 

30
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:29,981
how is the fraction changing. 
Well, the numerator's getting bigger the 

31
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:35,058
denominator's staying the same, the 
fraction should be getting bigger, which 

32
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:38,861
then tells us something about the SIGN of 
this derivative. 

33
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:43,242
We can similarly analyze the situation 
involving the denominator. 

34
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:49,689
So, if the numerator is positive and the 
denominator is positive and the numerator 

35
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,206
is not really changing, but the 
denominator is getting bigger then the 

36
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,912
fraction f of x over g of x is getting 
smaller. 

37
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,782
So that tells us, again, something about 
the sign of the derivative of this ratio. 

38
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:07,592
It's negative, because if the 
denominator's getting bigger, and the 

39
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:11,442
numerator's not really changing, this 
ratio is getting smaller. 

40
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:16,117
How does all of this help us to identify 
the actual quotient rule? How can we get 

41
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:19,982
rid of that imposter quotient rule. 
So we've got to guesses as to what the 

42
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:23,707
quotient rule might be and I've got some 
information that we just thought about, 

43
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,032
right if the function's values are 
positive and the numerator's getting 

44
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:30,507
bigger and the denominator's not really 
changing that means the fraction's 

45
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:33,082
getting bigger. 
If the numerator's not really changing 

46
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,622
but the denominator's getting bigger then 
that fraction's getting smaller. 

47
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,574
Now these are truths. 
And which of these truths are compatible 

48
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:43,263
with which of these guesses about the 
quotient rule? Well, let's take a look. 

49
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:47,208
This first guess about the quotient rule, 
let's see what happens if the numerator's 

50
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,912
not changing, but the denominator's 
getting bigger. 

51
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:53,922
If the numerator's not changing, that 
kills this whole first term and the 

52
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:57,727
derivative of f vanishes then. 
But the derivative that a nominator be 

53
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:01,207
positive, I'm imagining the value of the 
function is positive. 

54
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:05,137
So, this is a positive number but a 
negative sign there, so this is now a 

55
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,352
negative numerator divided by a positive 
number. 

56
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:11,557
So, if this were the quotient rule, it 
would be telling us that an increasing 

57
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:16,193
denominator makes this ratio smaller. 
It makes the derivative negative, 

58
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:19,099
that's good. 
That's really compatible with this 

59
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,171
picture. 
Now, is this compatible with that? Well, 

60
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:27,009
what would happen here if the denominator 
were increasing, but the numerator was 

61
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,501
staying the same? If the numerator's 
staying the same, this is zero, which 

62
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,432
kills this term. 
And I'm just left with this, 

63
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:38,622
and if the numerator is increasing then 
this term is positive and imagine the 

64
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:42,462
function's [UNKNOWN] positive. 
So you got a positive thing divided by 

65
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:45,257
positive thing. 
If these were the quotient row, an 

66
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:49,167
increasing denominator where the 
numerator remains the same would make 

67
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:53,187
this ratio Increase because this 
derivative would be positive or this 

68
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:57,493
can't be, this isn't the quotient rule, 
it's not compatible with this fact. 

69
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:01,861
In fact, this is the quotient rule and we 
can see that it's also compatible with 

70
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,988
this first fact. 
If the numerator is getting bigger but 

71
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:09,467
the denominator is staying the same well 
the denominator staying the same makes 

72
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:13,452
this term zero which kills this whole 
term and all I'm left with is this. 

73
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:17,398
Now imagine g is positive and the 
derivative of the numerator is positive. 

74
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:20,142
The derivator is getting bigger. 
This is positive, 

75
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:23,027
I've got a positive thing divided by a 
positive thing. 

76
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:26,144
That makes the derivative positive. 
And that makes sense. 

77
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:30,297
If the numerator's getting bigger and the 
denominator's staying the same, the 

78
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:34,942
derivative is positive and that's exactly 
what this true quotient rule is saying. 

79
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:40,878
Fundamentally, I don't want you just to 
memorize all of these rules. 

80
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:46,545
[MUSIC] I want you to understand why the 
rules are what they are. 

81
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:52,825
I want you to get a feeling for why 
there's a negative sign in the quotient 

82
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,548
rule. 
It really belongs there.
