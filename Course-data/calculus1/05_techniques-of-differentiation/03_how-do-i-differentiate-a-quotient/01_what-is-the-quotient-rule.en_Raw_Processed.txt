music given weve done so far we 
differentiate a bunch functions 
we differentiate sums differences 
products 
quotients 
given a fraction id like to able to 
differentiate that fraction 
i like to able to differentiate a 
really complicated looking function like 
fxxx, instance 
stuck immediately we 
dont anyways to differentiate 
quotients, until 
heres quotient rule so to state 
this really precisely lets suppose i got 
two functions f g i define a 
new function that im going to call 
h 
hx is this quotient fx gx 
i also want to make sure that 
denominator isnt point a so 
makes sense to evaluate this function 
point a 
i want ot assume that f g 
differential point a 
im trying to understand h 
changes so im going to need to know 
f g change input wiggles a 
bit 
alright so given this set up, i 
tell you derivative 
quotient is, derivative 
quotient a is denominator a 
times derivative numerator 
a 
minus numerator a times 
derivative denominator a, 
divided denominator a 
lets use quotient rule to 
differentiate function that we saw 
earlier 
so, function we thinking 
is fxx x 
i want to calculate derivative 
that, respect to x 
derivative this quotient is 
given to us quotient rule 
denominator times 
derivative numerator minus 
numerator times derivative 
denominator 
thats divided denominator 
squared 
now, ive calculated derivative 
this quotient in terms derivatives 
numerator denominator 
so we simplify this further, 
x times derivative this sum is 
sum derivatives 
derivative x 
derivative x times again, 
derivative a sum, so derivative 
x, respect to x plus 
derivative 
divided denominator, 
original denominator squared 
i keep going, 
ive got x times whats 
derivative x 
whats derivative this constant 
zero, minus x times, whats 
derivative x x, 
whats derivative 
derivative a constant zero, 
divided x 
so, this is derivative 
original function considering, 
theres differentiation to 
done we using quotient 
rule 
weve done a ton work 
differentiation so far, we differentiate 
sums, differences, products, 
quotients 
sorts functions we 
differentiate using rules 
well, heres one big collection 
if youve got a polynomial divided 
polynomial, things called 
rational functions 
sort an analogy rational numbers 
integers integers 
a polynomial a polynomial is 
analogy, called a rational 
function 
now, since this is a quotient two 
things you differentiate, you 
differentiate rational functions 
this is a huge class functions that 
you differentiate 
music i encourage you to practice 
quotient rule 
practice, youll able to 
differentiate rational function that 
we throw you 
music
