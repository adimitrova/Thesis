you
're
lost
.
you
're
trapped
on
a
desert
island
.
you
have
to
remember
the
quotient
rule
.
how
can
you
remember
the
quotient
rule
?
even
while
trapped
on
that
desert
island
,
you
'll
remember
the
vague
form
of
the
quotient
rule
.
you
'll
remember
,
the
numerator
looks
a
little
bit
like
the
product
rule
.
it
's
a
value
times
a
derivative
minus
the
other
value
times
the
other
derivative
.
but
,
you
might
not
remember
exactly
where
the
minus
sign
goes
,
right
?
you
do
n't
know
if
it
's
f
(
x
)
*g
(
x
)
-g
(
x
)
*f
(
x
)
,
or
the
other
way
around
,
g
(
x
)
*f
(
x
)
-f
(
x
)
*g
(
x
)
.
which
one
is
it
?
if
you
were
n't
trapped
on
the
desert
island
,
you
'd
have
access
to
wikipedia
.
and
you
could
just
look
up
the
quotient
rule
.
[
music
]
even
if
you
could
just
look
it
up
let
's
think
about
it
for
a
little
bit
.
why
is
the
quotient
rule
what
it
is
?
to
make
it
easy
on
ourselves
let
's
suppose
that
f
of
x
is
positive
and
g
of
x
is
positive
.
now
i
'm
trying
to
understand
some
of
the
derivative
of
the
quotient
which
is
really
how
is
the
quotient
changing
when
f
and
g
are
doing
some
changing
.
let
's
make
that
really
concrete
.
let
's
suppose
that
the
numerator
is
getting
bigger
but
the
denominator
is
staying
the
same
.
how
does
this
change
?
well
then
that
is
bigger
,
right
?
if
you
take
bigger
thing
and
cut
it
into
the
same
number
of
pieces
.
then
,
those
pieces
are
bigger
.
now
,
we
could
play
the
game
the
other
way
.
i
could
keep
the
pieces
the
same
size
,
but
increase
the
denominator
which
would
be
cutting
them
into
more
pieces
.
right
?
and
if
i
take
the
same
amount
of
stuff
and
divide
it
into
more
pieces
,
then
each
of
those
pieces
is
smaller
.
right
?
so
a
same
size
number
divided
by
a
bigger
number
now
this
fraction
is
smaller
.
how
does
this
relate
to
the
derivitaive
?
well
think
back
to
the
sign
,
the
s
i
g
n
of
the
derivative
.
so
same
set
up
,
f
of
x
is
positive
,
g
of
x
is
positive
,
maybe
the
denominator
is
n't
really
changing
,
but
the
numerator
,
is
getting
bigger
and
now
i
want
to
know
,
how
is
the
fraction
changing
.
well
,
the
numerator
's
getting
bigger
the
denominator
's
staying
the
same
,
the
fraction
should
be
getting
bigger
,
which
then
tells
us
something
about
the
sign
of
this
derivative
.
we
can
similarly
analyze
the
situation
involving
the
denominator
.
so
,
if
the
numerator
is
positive
and
the
denominator
is
positive
and
the
numerator
is
not
really
changing
,
but
the
denominator
is
getting
bigger
then
the
fraction
f
of
x
over
g
of
x
is
getting
smaller
.
so
that
tells
us
,
again
,
something
about
the
sign
of
the
derivative
of
this
ratio
.
it
's
negative
,
because
if
the
denominator
's
getting
bigger
,
and
the
numerator
's
not
really
changing
,
this
ratio
is
getting
smaller
.
how
does
all
of
this
help
us
to
identify
the
actual
quotient
rule
?
how
can
we
get
rid
of
that
imposter
quotient
rule
.
so
we
've
got
to
guesses
as
to
what
the
quotient
rule
might
be
and
i
've
got
some
information
that
we
just
thought
about
,
right
if
the
function
's
values
are
positive
and
the
numerator
's
getting
bigger
and
the
denominator
's
not
really
changing
that
means
the
fraction
's
getting
bigger
.
if
the
numerator
's
not
really
changing
but
the
denominator
's
getting
bigger
then
that
fraction
's
getting
smaller
.
now
these
are
truths
.
and
which
of
these
truths
are
compatible
with
which
of
these
guesses
about
the
quotient
rule
?
well
,
let
's
take
a
look
.
this
first
guess
about
the
quotient
rule
,
let
's
see
what
happens
if
the
numerator
's
not
changing
,
but
the
denominator
's
getting
bigger
.
if
the
numerator
's
not
changing
,
that
kills
this
whole
first
term
and
the
derivative
of
f
vanishes
then
.
but
the
derivative
that
a
nominator
be
positive
,
i
'm
imagining
the
value
of
the
function
is
positive
.
so
,
this
is
a
positive
number
but
a
negative
sign
there
,
so
this
is
now
a
negative
numerator
divided
by
a
positive
number
.
so
,
if
this
were
the
quotient
rule
,
it
would
be
telling
us
that
an
increasing
denominator
makes
this
ratio
smaller
.
it
makes
the
derivative
negative
,
that
's
good
.
that
's
really
compatible
with
this
picture
.
now
,
is
this
compatible
with
that
?
well
,
what
would
happen
here
if
the
denominator
were
increasing
,
but
the
numerator
was
staying
the
same
?
if
the
numerator
's
staying
the
same
,
this
is
zero
,
which
kills
this
term
.
and
i
'm
just
left
with
this
,
and
if
the
numerator
is
increasing
then
this
term
is
positive
and
imagine
the
function
's
[
unknown
]
positive
.
so
you
got
a
positive
thing
divided
by
positive
thing
.
if
these
were
the
quotient
row
,
an
increasing
denominator
where
the
numerator
remains
the
same
would
make
this
ratio
increase
because
this
derivative
would
be
positive
or
this
ca
n't
be
,
this
is
n't
the
quotient
rule
,
it
's
not
compatible
with
this
fact
.
in
fact
,
this
is
the
quotient
rule
and
we
can
see
that
it
's
also
compatible
with
this
first
fact
.
if
the
numerator
is
getting
bigger
but
the
denominator
is
staying
the
same
well
the
denominator
staying
the
same
makes
this
term
zero
which
kills
this
whole
term
and
all
i
'm
left
with
is
this
.
now
imagine
g
is
positive
and
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
is
positive
.
the
derivator
is
getting
bigger
.
this
is
positive
,
i
've
got
a
positive
thing
divided
by
a
positive
thing
.
that
makes
the
derivative
positive
.
and
that
makes
sense
.
if
the
numerator
's
getting
bigger
and
the
denominator
's
staying
the
same
,
the
derivative
is
positive
and
that
's
exactly
what
this
true
quotient
rule
is
saying
.
fundamentally
,
i
do
n't
want
you
just
to
memorize
all
of
these
rules
.
[
music
]
i
want
you
to
understand
why
the
rules
are
what
they
are
.
i
want
you
to
get
a
feeling
for
why
there
's
a
negative
sign
in
the
quotient
rule
.
it
really
belongs
there
.
