[music] if we care about extreme values, 
it would really help to know how to find 
them. 
we can use a theorem, a theorem of 
fermat. 
here's fermat's theorem. 
suppose f is a function and it's defined 
on the interval between a and b. 
c, is some point in this interval, this 
backwards e, means that c is in this 
interval. 
okay, so that's the set up. 
here's fermat's theorem. 
if f(c) is an extreme value of the 
function f, and the function is 
differentiable at the point c, then the 
derivitive vanishes at the point c. 
it's actually easier to show something 
slightly different. 
so, instead of dealing with this, i'm 
going to deal with a different statement. 
same setup as before, but now i'm going 
to try to show that if f is 
differentiable at point c and the 
derivative is nonzero, then f(c) is not 
an extreme value. 
it's worth thinking a little bit about 
the relationship between the original 
statement where i'm starting off with the 
claim that f(c) is an extreme value and 
then concluding that the derivative 
vanishes. 
and here, i'm beginning, by assuming the 
derivative doesn't vanish and then 
concluding that f(c) is not an extreme 
value. 
this is the thing that i want to try to 
prove now. 
why is that theorem true? i'm going to 
get some intuitive idea as to why this is 
true. 
why is it that if you differentiable a 
point c with nonzero derivative there, 
then f(c) isn't an extreme value? well, 
to get a sense of this, let's take a look 
at this graph. 
here, i've drawn a graph of some random 
function. 
i've picked some point and f'(c) is not 
zero. 
differentiable there, but the 
derivative's nonzero. 
it's negative. 
now, what does that mean? that means if i 
wiggle the input a little bit, i actually 
do affect the output. 
if i increase the input a bit, the output 
goes down. 
if i decrease the input a bit, the output 
goes up. 
consequently, that can't be an extreme 
value. 
that's not the biggest or the smallest 
value when i plug in inputs near c, and 
that's exactly what this statement is 
saying. 
if the derivative is not zero, that means 
i do have some control over the output if 
i change the input a little bit. 
that means this output isn't an extreme 
value because i can make the output 
bigger or smaller with small pervations 
to the input. 
i'd like to have a more formal, a more 
rigorous argument for this. 
so, let's suppose that f is 
differentiable at c, and the derivative 
is equal to l, l some nonzero number. 
now, what that really means from the 
definition of derivative is that the 
limit of f(c+h)-f(c)/h as h approaches 
zero is equal to l. 
now, what does this limit say? 
well, the limit's saying that if h is 
near enough zero, i can make this 
difference quotient as close as i like to 
l. 
in particular, i can guarantee that 
f(c+h)-f(c)/h is between 1/2l and 3/2l. 
notice what just happened. so, i started 
with infinitesimal information. 
i'm just starting with a limit as h 
approaches zero. 
and i've promoted this infinitesimal 
information to local information. 
now i know that this difference quotient 
is between these two numbers as long as h 
is close enough to zero. 
now, we can continue the proof. 
so, i know that if h is close enough to 
zero, this difference quotion is between 
1/2l and 3/2l, 
i'm going to multiply all this by h. 
what do i find out then? then, i find out 
that if h is near enough zero, 
multiplying all this by h, i find that 
f(c+h)-f(c)/h*h is between 1/2hl and 
3/2hl. 
i get from here to here just by 
multiplying by h. 
now, what can i do? well, i can add f(c) 
to all of this. 
and i'll find out that if h is near 
enough zero, then f(c+h) is between 
1/2hl+f(c) and 3/2hl+f(c). 
okay. 
so, this is what we've shown. we've shown 
that if h is small enough, f(c+h) is 
between these two numbers. 
now, why would you care? well, think 
about some possibilities. 
what if l is positive? 
if l is positive and h is some small but 
positive number, this is telling me that 
f(c+h), being between these two numbers, 
f(c+h) is in particular bigger than f(c). 
that means that f(c) can't be a local 
maximum. 
same kind of game. 
what if l is positive but i picked h to 
be negative but real close to zero. 
then, f(c+h) being between these two 
numbers, f(c+h) must actually be less 
than f(c). 
that means that f(c) can't be a local 
minimum. 
you play the same game when l is 
negative. 
let's summarize what we've shown. 
so, what we've shown is this. 
we've shown that if a differentiable 
function has nonzero derivative at the 
point c, then f(c) is not an extreme 
value. 
and we can play this in reverse. that 
means that if f(c) is a local extrema, 
right? if f(c) is an extreme value, then 
either the derivative doesn't exist to 
prevent this first case from happening, 
where f is differentiable at c, or the 
derivatives equal to zero, which prevents 
this second thing, f'(c) being nonzero. 
so, this is another way to summarize what 
we've done. 
if f(c) is a local extremum, then one of 
these two possibilities occurs. 
both of these possibilities do occur. 
here's the graph of the absolute value 
function. 
there's a local and a global minimum at 
the point zero. 
the derivative of this function isn't 
defined at that point. 
here's another example. 
here's the graph of y=x^2. 
this function also has a local and a 
global minimum at the point zero. 
here, the derivative is defined but the 
derivative is equal to zero at this 
point. 
we'll often want to talk about these two 
cases together, the situation where the 
derivative doesn't exist and the 
situation where the derivative vanishes. 
let's give it a name to this phenomenon. 
here we go. if either the derivative at c 
doesn't exist, meaning the function's not 
differentiable at c, or the derivative is 
equal to zero, then i'm going to call the 
point c a critical point for the function 
f. 
this is a great definition because it 
fits so well into fermats theorem. 
here's another way to say fermot's 
theorem. 
suppose f is a function as defined in 
this interval and c is contained in 
there, then if f(c) is an extreme value 
of f, 
well, we know that one of two 
possibilities must occur. 
at that point, either the function's not 
differentiable, or the derivative's equal 
to zero. 
and that's exactly what we mean when i 
say that c is a critical point of f. 
so, giving a name to this phenomena gives 
us a really nice way of stating fermat's 
theorem. 
the upshot is that if you want to find 
extreme values for a function, you don't 
have to look everywhere. 
you only have to look at the critical 
points where the derivative either 
doesn't exist or the derivative vanishes. 
and you should probably also worry about 
the end points. 
in other words, if you're trying to find 
rain, you should just be looking for 
clouds. 
you just have to check the cloudy days to 
see if it's raining. 
in this same way, if you're looking for 
extreme values, you only need to look for 
the critical points because an extreme 
value gives you a critical point. 
so, this is a super concrete example. 
here's a function, y=x^3-x. 
i've graphed this function. 
i'm going to try to find these local 
extrema, this local maximum and this 
local minimum, using the machinery that 
we've set up. 
so, if i'm looking for local extrema, i 
should be looking for critical points. 
so, here's the function, f(x)=x^3-x. 
i'm looking for for critical points in 
this function. 
those are points whose derivative doesn't 
exist, function is not differentiable, or 
the derivative vanishes. 
but this function is differentiable 
everywhere. 
its derivative is 3x^2-1. 
so, the only critical points are going to 
be where the derivative is equal to zero, 
right? 
i'm looking for solutions to 3x^2-1=0. 
i'll write one to both sides, 3x^2=1, so 
i am trying to solve. 
i'll divide both sides by 3, 
x^2=1/3. 
so, i am trying to solve. 
take the square root of both sides. 
x is plus or minus the square root of a 
third, which is about 0.577. 
and that let's me find these critical 
points, 
right? 
these are places where the derivative is 
equal to zero. 
the tangent line is horizontal and now i 
know the x coordinate of these two red 
points. 
here, are the x coordinates about 0.577, 
and here the x coordinate is -0.577, 
about.
