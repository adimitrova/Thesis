music goal computing is 
numbers insight 
i dont care that f is equal to four 
i care qualitative features 
a function 
heres a graph random function i 
made 
a significant qualitative feature this 
graph is that right here is a valley in 
graph here is a mountaintop 
speaking mountaintops valleys is 
maybe metaphorical, precise 
enough 
lets try to work a better 
definition 
so, instead calling this a mountain 
top, im going to call that a local 
maximum 
lets even a little bit precise 
lets suppose that that maximum value 
occurs input c, output 
is fc 
im going to call fc local maximum 
value function near input c 
heres a precise definition, 
fc is a local maximum value f if 
whenever x is near input c, fc is 
bigger equal to fx 
maybe this isnt even precise enough 
a big sticking point this is this 
word near 
thats sort a weasley word 
i make this near precise like 
weve limits 
ill introduce sum epsilon 
so fc is a local maximum value 
function f, if theres small number, 
thats i mean near 
so that whenever x is near c, 
near c, now, im in between c 
epislon c epsilon 
this is really close to c if epsilon is 
real small 
okay 
so that, whenever x is contained in this 
interval, fc is bigger equal to 
fx 
we give a similar sort definition 
valleys 
heres that graph ive 
highlighted a local minimum graph 
this function 
near input c, fc is smallest 
output function 
a little bit precisely, im calling 
a local minimum value, 
whenever x is near c, fc is 
less equal to fx 
even a little bit precisely 
like local maximums, i 
replace near espilon 
so fc is a local minimum value 
function, if theres epsilon 
measuring nearness, so that whenever 
x is between c epsilon, c epsilon, 
fc is less equal to fx 
sometimes, im going to want to talk 
simultaneously local maximums 
local minimums 
so, well call either a local minimum 
a local maximum a local extremum 
this is kind a pretentious word, 
a word that we use so 
that we talk 
concepts simultaneously, 
actually share quite a few 
features in common 
if i want to talk multiple 
extremums well, if we wanted to 
talk an octopus well, thats 
really a problem, 
but, if you wanted to talk two 
things you might call an 
octopus, you might call an octopuses 

but, youll find people will get 
angry you if you that i want 
you to call octopi 
i probably dont really agree them, 
but, problem comes 
minimums maximums extremums 
youre going to find people will 
demand that you call minima, 
maxima, extrema if youre talking 
one things, 
really, either is fine 
world local here is really in 
contrast to world global 
well say, in fact, everyone will say 
that fc is a global maximum value 
function f if output 
function is larger fc 
maybe thats cute a way to say 
heres a precise way to say it, 
fc is a global maximum value 
function if whenever x is in domain 
f, 
im going to considering inputs 
in domain, course, 
fc is bigger equal to 
fx 
deal minimal values, 
fc is a global minimum value 
function if whenever ive got a point in 
domain fc is less equal to 
fx 
one subtle thing to point here is 
that im claiming, say global 
maximum values that this is biggest 
output function 
im saying is that output 
isnt larger fc, 
fc is bigger equal to 
output function deal 
this global minimum 
im saying this is smallest 
output function, im saying 
that output is bigger 
equal to this output 
we see examples this 
this 
heres that graph weve looking 
so many times here 
lets try to figure local 
extrema 
this point here is a local maximum, 
thats biggest output value 
nearby input values 
this point here is a local minimum, 
right youre sitting in that valley, 
thats smallest output valley among 
nearby inputs and, here is another 
local max this local maximum is also 
a global maximum 
i mean, if youre really assuming that 
this graph continues to 
left righthand sides, 
you also note that if you really 
believe this thing continues like 
this, this function global 
minimum 
nobodys promising you that there is a 
global minimum a global maximum, 
in this case, there isnt one 
theres global minimum 
there definitely multiple local 
maximums, 
there also multiple global 
maximums 
so here, ive drawn another graph, 
ive rigged so that two output 
values 
so local maximums, 
theyre also global maximums 
alright so in this case, 
global also local maximums 
theres even more, dare i say it, extreme 
version this 
here, ive graphed constant function 
y is a global maximum a 
global minimum this constant 
function 
distinction between local global 
maximums is really quite important, even 
in everyday life 
youre standing a local maximum, 
top this mountain, small 
changes to situation make 
things worse, 
yet, if youre willing to go 
this valley, youll eventually come 
here to least appears to to 
global maximum this function
