00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,087
[MUSIC] The goal of computing is not 
numbers but insight. 

2
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:11,462
I don't care that f(2) is equal to four. 
I do care about the qualitative features 

3
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:16,262
of a function. 
Here's a graph of some random function I 

4
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:21,212
just made up. 
A significant qualitative feature of this 

5
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:27,774
graph is that right here is a valley in 
the graph and up here is a mountaintop. 

6
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:34,020
Speaking of mountaintops and valleys is 
maybe too metaphorical, not precise 

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,973
enough. 
Let's try to work out a better 

8
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:41,162
definition. 
So, instead of calling this a mountain 

9
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:44,472
top, I'm going to call that a local 
maximum. 

10
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:49,722
Let's be even a little bit more precise. 
Let's suppose that that maximum value 

11
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:53,582
occurs at the input c, where the output 
is f(c). 

12
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:59,922
I'm going to call f(c) the local maximum 
value of the function near the input c. 

13
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:06,207
Here's a precise definition, 
f(c) is a local maximum value for f if 

14
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:12,617
whenever x is near the input c, f(c) is 
bigger than or equal to f(x). 

15
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:19,669
Maybe this isn't even precise enough. 
A big sticking point with this is this 

16
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:22,674
word near. 
That's sort of a weasley word. 

17
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:27,495
I can make this near precise just like 
we've been doing with limits. 

18
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:32,263
I'll introduce sum epsilon. 
So f(c) is a local maximum value for the 

19
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:37,109
function f, if there's some small number, 
that's what I mean by near. 

20
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,640
So that whenever x is near c, 
and by near c, now, I'm in between c- 

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,943
epislon and c+ epsilon. 
This is really close to c if epsilon is 

22
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,289
real small. 
Okay. 

23
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:53,773
So that, whenever x is contained in this 
interval, f(c) is bigger then or equal to 

24
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,103
f(x). 
We can give a similar sort of definition 

25
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:01,338
for the valleys. 
Here's that same graph again and I've 

26
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:05,932
highlighted a local minimum on the graph 
of this function. 

27
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:11,272
Near the input c, f(c) is the smallest 
output for the function. 

28
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:16,847
A little bit more precisely, I'm calling 
it a local minimum value, 

29
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:21,907
because whenever x is near c, f(c) is 
less than or equal to f(x). 

30
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:28,412
Or even a little bit more precisely again 
just like for local maximums, I can 

31
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:33,905
replace near with espilon. 
So f(c) is a local minimum value for the 

32
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:39,798
function, if there's some epsilon 
measuring the nearness, so that whenever 

33
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:44,026
x is between c- epsilon, and c+ epsilon, 
f(c) is less than or equal to f(x). 

34
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:50,031
Sometimes, I'm going to want to talk 
simultaneously about local maximums and 

35
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:53,825
local minimums. 
So, we'll call either a local minimum or 

36
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:57,962
a local maximum a local extremum. 
And this is kind of a pretentious word, 

37
00:02:57,962 --> 00:03:02,306
but it's just a word that we can use so 
that we can talk about both of these 

38
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:06,252
concepts simultaneously, 
because they actually share quite a few 

39
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,654
features in common. 
What if I want to talk about multiple 

40
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:13,947
extremums? Well, what if we wanted to 
talk about an octopus? Well, that's not 

41
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:16,889
really a problem, 
but, what if you wanted to talk about two 

42
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,903
of these things? You might not call it an 
octopus, you might call it an octopuses 

43
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:23,043
now. 
But, you'll find some people will get 

44
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,682
angry at you if you do that and I want 
you to call these octopi. 

45
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:31,620
I probably don't really agree with them, 
but, the same problem comes up with 

46
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,297
minimums and maximums and extremums. 
You're going to find some people who will 

47
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:40,888
demand that you call these minima, 
maxima, and extrema if you're talking 

48
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,972
about more than one of these things, 
but really, either is fine. 

49
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:50,549
The world local here is really in 
contrast to the world global. 

50
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:57,387
We'll say, in fact, everyone will say 
that f(c) is a global maximum value for 

51
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:03,039
the function f if no output of the 
function is larger than f(c). 

52
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,593
Maybe that's too cute of a way to say it. 
Here's a more precise way to say it, 

53
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:15,139
f(c) is a global maximum value for the 
function if whenever x is in the domain 

54
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,460
of f, 
I'm only going to be considering inputs 

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,500
in the domain, of course, 
then f(c) is bigger than or equal to 

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,592
f(x). 
Do the same deal for minimal values, 

57
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:32,240
f(c) is a global minimum value for the 
function if whenever I've got a point in 

58
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,948
the domain f(c) is less than or equal to 
f(x). 

59
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:39,457
One subtle thing to point out here is 
that I'm not claiming, say for global 

60
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:44,103
maximum values that this is the biggest 
output of the function. 

61
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:48,785
What I'm saying is that any other output 
isn't larger than f(c), 

62
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:53,368
f(c) is bigger than or equal to any other 
output of the function and the same deal 

63
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:56,968
for this global minimum. 
I'm not saying this is the smallest 

64
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:01,658
output of the function, I'm just saying 
that any other output is bigger than or 

65
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:05,422
equal to this output. 
Now we can see some examples of this. 

66
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:09,452
Of this. 
Here's that same graph we've been looking 

67
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:14,302
at so many times here. 
Let's try to figure out where the local 

68
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:18,062
extrema are. 
this point here is a local maximum, 

69
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:22,747
that's the biggest output value for 
nearby input values. 

70
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:28,552
This point here is a local minimum, 
right? You're sitting in that valley, 

71
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:34,427
that's the smallest output valley among 
nearby inputs. And, up here is another 

72
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:38,917
local max and this local maximum is also 
a global maximum. 

73
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:44,682
I mean, if you're really assuming that 
this graph just continues down to the 

74
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:48,976
left and the right-hand sides, 
you should also note that if you really 

75
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:53,449
believe this thing continues down like 
this, this function has no global 

76
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,394
minimum. 
Nobody's promising you that there is a 

77
00:05:56,394 --> 00:06:00,645
global minimum or a global maximum, but 
in this case, there isn't one. 

78
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:06,465
There's no global minimum. 
There can definitely be multiple local 

79
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:10,050
maximums, 
but there can also be multiple global 

80
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,937
maximums. 
So here, I've drawn another graph, where 

81
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:18,210
I've rigged it so that these two output 
values are the same. 

82
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,840
So these are both local maximums, 
but they're also both global maximums. 

83
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,300
Alright? So in this case, these are both 
global and also local maximums. 

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,498
There's even more, dare I say it, extreme 
version of this. 

85
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:44,620
Here, I've graphed the constant function 
y=17 is both a global maximum and a 

86
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,236
global minimum for this constant 
function. 

87
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:55,071
The distinction between local and global 
maximums is really quite important, even 

88
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:59,966
in everyday life. 
When you're standing at a local maximum, 

89
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:05,594
on the top of this mountain, small 
changes to your situation just make 

90
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:09,989
things worse, 
and yet, if you're willing to go through 

91
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:16,238
this valley, you'll eventually come up 
here to what at least appears to be to 

92
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:19,712
global maximum of this function. 

93
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,868
