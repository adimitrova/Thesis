music people idea that a local 
minimum means function decreases 
increases 
heres a local minimum graph 
this random function 
misconception is that 
look like this 
that every time you got a local minimum 
one side, functions decreasing, 
side functions 
increasing 
plenty local minima look exactly 
like that but, theres also plenty 
pathological examples 
instance, consider this a somewhat 
pathological example 
im going to define this function f a 
piecewise function 
if inputs nonzero, im going to 
this sinx, makes sense since 
x isnt zero, time x 
if input is zero, functions 
output will also zero 
in this case, theres a local minimum 
zero 
i know well, heres i know 
lets take a look this function 
claim is that fx is never negative 
i know that well, i know 
sine sine absolutely anything 
all, matter i take this sine 
of, is between 
now, if i add to this, plus sine 
absolutely anything all, 
is between zero two 
now, thats pretty good 
now, think back to definition this 
function 
here, ive got plus sine something, 
doesnt matter what, 
alright 
plus sine anything, 
this is between zero two 
now, 
im multiplying x 
i know x well, x is 
negative 
could zero, could positive 
matter x is, x is 
negative 
now, im multiplying sinx, this 
number is trapped between zero 
to, x is never negative 
that means fx is negative long 
x isnt equal to zero, 
alright 
long x isnt equal to zero i mean, 
this first case this is a 
nonnegative number times a nonnegative 
number, so product is also 
nonnegative 
now, possibility, course, is 
that i plug in zero x 
then, f is definition 
zero 
that means in either case, matter 
that i plug in x, fx is never a 
negative 
if fx is never negative f, 
i know that this must 
smallest possible output value 
function 
numbers that smaller 
zero negative numbers, output 
this function is never negative 
this isnt usual sort local 
minimum function decreases 
increases 
well, heres graph funciton 
f 
and, there is a local minimum zero, 
if i start zooming in, matter 
much i zoom in, theres little region 
graph is decreasing 
increasing 
graph is always wiggling 
upshot here is that decreasing 
increasing is one way to produce a 
local minimum, 
definition a local minimum 
every local minimum arises in 
that exact way 
a local minimum means is that 
nearby output value is smaller 
that local minimum value
