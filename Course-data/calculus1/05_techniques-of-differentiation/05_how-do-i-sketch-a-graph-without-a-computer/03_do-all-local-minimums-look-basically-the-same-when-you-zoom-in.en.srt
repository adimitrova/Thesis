[MUSIC] People have the idea that a local 
minimum means the function decreases and 

2
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:10,783
then increases. 
Here's a local minimum on the graph of 

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,597
this random function. 
And the misconception is that they all 

4
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:20,092
look like this. 
That every time you got a local minimum 

5
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:24,994
on one side, the function's decreasing, 
and on the other side the function's 

6
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:28,807
increasing. 
Plenty of local minima do look exactly 

7
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:33,138
like that. But, there's also plenty of 
pathological examples. 

8
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:37,492
For instance, consider this a somewhat 
pathological example. 

9
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:42,519
I'm going to define this function f as a 
piecewise function. 

10
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:49,826
If the input's nonzero, I'm going to do 
this. 1+sin(1/x), which makes sense since 

11
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:54,285
x isn't zero, time x^2. 
And if the input is zero, the function's 

12
00:00:54,285 --> 00:01:00,546
output will also be zero. 
In this case, there's a local minimum at 

13
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:05,087
zero. 
How do I know? Well, here's how I know. 

14
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:13,361
Let's take a look at this function The 
claim is that f(x) is never negative. 

15
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:22,447
How do I know that? Well, what do I know 
about sine? Sine of absolutely anything 

16
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:29,438
at all, no matter what I take this sine 
of, is between -1 and 1. 

17
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:36,512
Now, if I add 1 to this, 1 plus sine of 
absolutely anything at all, 

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,625
is between zero and two. 
Now, that's pretty good. 

19
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,781
Now, think back to the definition of this 
function. 

20
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:49,080
Here, I've got 1 plus sine of something, 
it doesn't matter what, 

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,233
alright? 
1 plus sine of anything, 

22
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,682
this is between zero and two. 
Now, 

23
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:59,131
I'm multiplying it by x^2. 
What do I know about x^2? Well, x^2 is 

24
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:03,812
not negative. 
It could be zero, it could be positive. 

25
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:07,742
But no matter what x is, x^2 is not 
negative. 

26
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:16,420
Now, I'm multiplying 1+sin(1/x), this 
number which is trapped between zero and 

27
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:25,329
to, by x^2 which is never negative. And 
that means f(x) is not negative as long 

28
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:28,423
as x isn't equal to zero, 
alright? 

29
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:32,539
As long as x isn't equal to zero. I mean, 
this first case and this is a 

30
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:37,494
non-negative number times a non-negative 
number, so the product is also 

31
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:41,332
non-negative. 
Now, the other possibility, of course, is 

32
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:45,192
that I plug in zero for x. 
But then, f(0) is just by definition 

33
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,991
zero. 
And that means in either case, no matter 

34
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,412
that I plug in for x, f(x) is never a 
negative. 

35
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:56,087
Now if f(x) is never negative and f(0)=0, 
then I know that this must be the 

36
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:59,227
smallest possible output value for the 
function. 

37
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:03,987
The only numbers that are smaller than 
zero are negative numbers, and the output 

38
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:08,632
of this function is never negative. But 
this isn't the usual sort of local 

39
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:12,592
minimum where the function just decreases 
and then increases. 

40
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,206
Well, here's the graph for our funciton 
f. 

41
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:20,019
And, there is a local minimum at zero, 
but if I start zooming in, no matter how 

42
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,841
much I zoom in, there's no little region 
on which the graph is just decreasing and 

43
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,746
then increasing. 
The graph is always wiggling. 

44
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:32,501
The upshot here is that decreasing and 
then increasing is one way to produce a 

45
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,402
local minimum, but it's not the 
definition of a local minimum. 

46
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:39,732
And not every local minimum arises in 
that exact way. 

47
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:45,099
What a local minimum means is just that 
no nearby output value is smaller than 

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,825
that local minimum value.
