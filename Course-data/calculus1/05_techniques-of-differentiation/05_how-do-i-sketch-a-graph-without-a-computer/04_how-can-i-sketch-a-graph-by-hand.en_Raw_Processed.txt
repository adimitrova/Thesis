music suppose ive got function 
given a rule i want to make a 
graph that function 
i wanted to plot say this function fx 
equals x cubed minus x squared minus 
first thing i might is plug in 
values 
right ill pick 
pick inputs ill see 
function outputs inputs 
ive got this table values, i 
could plot points a graph 
issue is, i really know 
happens between points that i 
plotted graph i know 
graph isnt crazy wiggling in 
between i know that ive really 
picked enough input points to really get 
a good idea this graph is 
going to use derivatives to make 
sure that really capturing 
qualitative features function 
i might trying to graph a 
function, like fx equals sin pi x, 
if i plugged in whole number 
inputs, function would always output 
that might trick making a graph 
like this, i plot output 
whole number inputs 
i might, then, tempted to fill in 
this graph drawing a straight line 
across 
thats totally ridiculous, right 
this graph, you know, actually looks like 
this 
a horizontal straight line 
theres kinds extra wiggling 
thats happening that i missed i 
chose in points badly 
going to use derivatives to make 
sure that really capturing 
qualitative features function 
theres a ton different ways to 
this 
so lets work this in one specific 
concrete example 
so lets keep working graph 
this function, fx equals x cubed minus 
x squared minus x 
first thing im going to is 
differentiate this, 
derivative is xx, 
cause derivative x is x, 
derivative minus x is minus x, 
derivative minus x is minus 
theres a common factor here i 
pull out, im left this 
quadratic, i factor that 
quadratic x times x 
ive got this nice factorized 
version derivative, i 
figure derivative is 
positive negative 
derivative is positive input 
is negative minus 
positive input is positive 

in between , derivative is 
negative 
point , point , 
derivative is equal to zero 
now, since this function is 
differentiable everywhere, 
critical points derivative 
is equal to zero 
critical points, minus 

alright 
so i found critical points 
i found derivative 
now, ill also find second derivative 
this function 
i get differentiating this 
derivative 
if i differentiate x i get x, if i 
differentiate minus x i get minus , 
if i differentiate minus i get 
zero 
again, ive got a common factor six so 
ill pull that im left 
x 
i think sign 
second derivative 
i know that well, 
second derivative is negative if i plug 
in an x value is less 
second derivative is positive if i 
plug in an x value is bigger 
right, i know a lot 
information sign first 
second derivative, so i use 
this information to say something 
function 
let look back to preliminary graph 
that i made plugging in a few 
points 
right, so here i plugged in a few 
points id like to able to 
say is is function 
increasing decreasing 
looking sign first 
derivative i know that functions 
increasing, decreasing, 
increasing 
minus critical point 
in fact, theyre local extrema 
this is a local maximum value, this 
is a local minimum value here, i 
also see that considering 
information given in sine 
second derivative 
since second derivatives negative 
here, functions concave 
since second derivative is 
positive here, function is 
concave 
that makes this point a local 
maximum this point a local 
minimum 
alright, that ive got that 
information i try to fix 
graph here filling in 
so lets see, so ive got points 
here i know i know 
function is increasing here, i 
know that decreasing here 
i know that concaved in 
this region 
rest graph rest 
concave 
theres an inflection point here 
x this point here is a local 
minumum 
functions decreasing looking 
sign first derivative, until i 
get to two 
i get to two, first 
derivative tells functions 
increasing 
so there we go, 
ive drawn a graph function 
point here is to capture a 
perfect picture function 
like an impressionistic painting, 
point is to capture 
meaning emotion 
function 
compare that to a photograph might 
a perfectly accurate portrayal, 
somehow misses everything thats 
essential 
so heres graph that i drew in red, 
here is a perfect graph 
admittedly, that soulless robot drew 
youll see that graph really is 
good 
i mean, captures qualitative 
information is really a human 
cares 
functions increasing, decreasing, 
increasing 
you see concave 
concave 
you kind see roughly 
this function crosses x axis 
lets summarize situation 
theres really basic pieces that youre 
gluing together youre a 
lot curve sketching problems 
depends sign first 
derivative, sign second 
derivative 
if derivative is positive, 
second derivative is positive, 
function is increasing, slopes 
tangent lines increasing 
if functions derivative is negative 
second derivative is positive, 
that means although functions 
decreasing, slopes tangent 
lines increasing 
weve got kind complementary pictures 
here second derivatives 
negative, here functions increasing 
slopes tangent lines 
decreasing, here function is 
decreasing slopes tangent 
lines decreasing 
a lot curve sketching problems 
amount to gluing together four 
basic pieces in appropriate way
