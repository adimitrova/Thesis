music if we care extreme values, 
would really help to know to find 

we use a theorem, a theorem 
fermat 
heres fermats theorem 
suppose f is a function defined 
interval between a b 
c, is point in this interval, this 
backwards e, means that c is in this 
interval 
okay, so thats set 
heres fermats theorem 
if fc is an extreme value 
function f, function is 
differentiable point c, 
derivitive vanishes point c 
actually easier to show something 
slightly different 
so, instead dealing this, im 
going to deal a different statement 
setup before, im going 
to try to show that if f is 
differentiable point c 
derivative is nonzero, fc is 
an extreme value 
worth thinking a little bit 
relationship between original 
statement im starting 
claim that fc is an extreme value 
concluding that derivative 
vanishes 
here, im beginning, assuming 
derivative doesnt vanish 
concluding that fc is an extreme 
value 
this is thing that i want to try to 
prove 
is that theorem true im going to 
get intuitive idea to this is 
true 
is that if you differentiable a 
point c nonzero derivative there, 
fc isnt an extreme value well, 
to get a sense this, lets take a look 
this graph 
here, ive drawn a graph random 
function 
ive picked point fc is 
zero 
differentiable there, 
derivatives nonzero 
negative 
now, that mean that means if i 
wiggle input a little bit, i actually 
affect output 
if i increase input a bit, output 
goes 
if i decrease input a bit, output 
goes 
consequently, that cant an extreme 
value 
thats biggest smallest 
value i plug in inputs near c, 
thats exactly this statement is 
saying 
if derivative is zero, that means 
i control output if 
i change input a little bit 
that means this output isnt an extreme 
value i make output 
bigger smaller small pervations 
to input 
id like to a formal, a 
rigorous argument this 
so, lets suppose that f is 
differentiable c, derivative 
is equal to l, l nonzero number 
now, that really means 
definition derivative is that 
limit fchfch h approaches 
zero is equal to l 
now, this limit say 
well, limits saying that if h is 
near enough zero, i make this 
difference quotient close i like to 
l 
in particular, i guarantee that 
fchfch is between l l 
notice happened so, i started 
infinitesimal information 
im starting a limit h 
approaches zero 
ive promoted this infinitesimal 
information to local information 
i know that this difference quotient 
is between two numbers long h 
is close enough to zero 
now, we continue proof 
so, i know that if h is close enough to 
zero, this difference quotion is between 
l l, 
im going to multiply this h 
i find then, i find 
that if h is near enough zero, 
multiplying this h, i find that 
fchfchh is between hl 
hl 
i get here to here 
multiplying h 
now, i well, i add fc 
to this 
ill find that if h is near 
enough zero, fch is between 
hlfc hlfc 
okay 
so, this is weve shown weve shown 
that if h is small enough, fch is 
between two numbers 
now, would you care well, think 
possibilities 
if l is positive 
if l is positive h is small 
positive number, this is telling that 
fch, between two numbers, 
fch is in particular bigger fc 
that means that fc cant a local 
maximum 
kind game 
if l is positive i picked h to 
negative real close to zero 
then, fch between two 
numbers, fch must actually less 
fc 
that means that fc cant a local 
minimum 
you play game l is 
negative 
lets summarize weve shown 
so, weve shown is this 
weve shown that if a differentiable 
function nonzero derivative 
point c, fc is an extreme 
value 
we play this in reverse that 
means that if fc is a local extrema, 
right if fc is an extreme value, 
either derivative doesnt exist to 
prevent this first case happening, 
f is differentiable c, 
derivatives equal to zero, prevents 
this second thing, fc nonzero 
so, this is another way to summarize 
weve done 
if fc is a local extremum, one 
two possibilities occurs 
possibilities occur 
heres graph absolute value 
function 
theres a local a global minimum 
point zero 
derivative this function isnt 
defined that point 
heres another example 
heres graph yx 
this function also a local a 
global minimum point zero 
here, derivative is defined 
derivative is equal to zero this 
point 
well often want to talk two 
cases together, situation 
derivative doesnt exist 
situation derivative vanishes 
lets give a name to this phenomenon 
here we go if either derivative c 
doesnt exist, meaning functions 
differentiable c, derivative is 
equal to zero, im going to call 
point c a critical point function 
f 
this is a great definition 
fits so well fermats theorem 
heres another way to say fermots 
theorem 
suppose f is a function defined in 
this interval c is contained in 
there, if fc is an extreme value 
f, 
well, we know that one two 
possibilities must occur 
that point, either functions 
differentiable, derivatives equal 
to zero 
thats exactly we mean i 
say that c is a critical point f 
so, giving a name to this phenomena gives 
us a really nice way stating fermats 
theorem 
upshot is that if you want to find 
extreme values a function, you dont 
to look everywhere 
you to look critical 
points derivative either 
doesnt exist derivative vanishes 
you probably also worry 
end points 
in words, if youre trying to find 
rain, you looking 
clouds 
you to check cloudy days to 
see if raining 
in this way, if youre looking 
extreme values, you need to look 
critical points an extreme 
value gives you a critical point 
so, this is a super concrete example 
heres a function, yxx 
ive graphed this function 
im going to try to find local 
extrema, this local maximum this 
local minimum, using machinery that 
weve set 
so, if im looking local extrema, i 
looking critical points 
so, heres function, fxxx 
im looking critical points in 
this function 
points whose derivative doesnt 
exist, function is differentiable, 
derivative vanishes 
this function is differentiable 
everywhere 
derivative is x 
so, critical points going to 
derivative is equal to zero, 
right 
im looking solutions to x 
ill write one to sides, x, so 
i trying to solve 
ill divide sides , 
x 
so, i trying to solve 
take square root sides 
x is plus minus square root a 
third, is 
that lets find critical 
points, 
right 
places derivative is 
equal to zero 
tangent line is horizontal i 
know x coordinate two red 
points 
here, x coordinates , 
here x coordinate is ,
