people
have
the
idea
that
a
local
minimum
means
the
function
decreases
and
then
increases
.
here
's
a
local
minimum
on
the
graph
of
this
random
function
.
and
the
misconception
is
that
they
all
look
like
this
.
that
every
time
you
got
a
local
minimum
on
one
side
,
the
function
's
decreasing
,
and
on
the
other
side
the
function
's
increasing
.
plenty
of
local
minima
do
look
exactly
like
that
.
but
,
there
's
also
plenty
of
pathological
examples
.
for
instance
,
consider
this
a
somewhat
pathological
example
.
i
'm
going
to
define
this
function
f
as
a
piecewise
function
.
if
the
input
's
nonzero
,
i
'm
going
to
do
this
.
1+sin
(
1/x
)
,
which
makes
sense
since
x
is
n't
zero
,
time
x^2
.
and
if
the
input
is
zero
,
the
function
's
output
will
also
be
zero
.
in
this
case
,
there
's
a
local
minimum
at
zero
.
how
do
i
know
?
well
,
here
's
how
i
know
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
this
function
the
claim
is
that
f
(
x
)
is
never
negative
.
how
do
i
know
that
?
well
,
what
do
i
know
about
sine
?
sine
of
absolutely
anything
at
all
,
no
matter
what
i
take
this
sine
of
,
is
between
-1
and
1.
now
,
if
i
add
1
to
this
,
1
plus
sine
of
absolutely
anything
at
all
,
is
between
zero
and
two
.
now
,
that
's
pretty
good
.
now
,
think
back
to
the
definition
of
this
function
.
here
,
i
've
got
1
plus
sine
of
something
,
it
does
n't
matter
what
,
alright
?
1
plus
sine
of
anything
,
this
is
between
zero
and
two
.
now
,
i
'm
multiplying
it
by
x^2
.
what
do
i
know
about
x^2
?
well
,
x^2
is
not
negative
.
it
could
be
zero
,
it
could
be
positive
.
but
no
matter
what
x
is
,
x^2
is
not
negative
.
now
,
i
'm
multiplying
1+sin
(
1/x
)
,
this
number
which
is
trapped
between
zero
and
to
,
by
x^2
which
is
never
negative
.
and
that
means
f
(
x
)
is
not
negative
as
long
as
x
is
n't
equal
to
zero
,
alright
?
as
long
as
x
is
n't
equal
to
zero
.
i
mean
,
this
first
case
and
this
is
a
non-negative
number
times
a
non-negative
number
,
so
the
product
is
also
non-negative
.
now
,
the
other
possibility
,
of
course
,
is
that
i
plug
in
zero
for
x.
but
then
,
f
(
0
)
is
just
by
definition
zero
.
and
that
means
in
either
case
,
no
matter
that
i
plug
in
for
x
,
f
(
x
)
is
never
a
negative
.
now
if
f
(
x
)
is
never
negative
and
f
(
0
)
=0
,
then
i
know
that
this
must
be
the
smallest
possible
output
value
for
the
function
.
the
only
numbers
that
are
smaller
than
zero
are
negative
numbers
,
and
the
output
of
this
function
is
never
negative
.
but
this
is
n't
the
usual
sort
of
local
minimum
where
the
function
just
decreases
and
then
increases
.
well
,
here
's
the
graph
for
our
funciton
f.
and
,
there
is
a
local
minimum
at
zero
,
but
if
i
start
zooming
in
,
no
matter
how
much
i
zoom
in
,
there
's
no
little
region
on
which
the
graph
is
just
decreasing
and
then
increasing
.
the
graph
is
always
wiggling
.
the
upshot
here
is
that
decreasing
and
then
increasing
is
one
way
to
produce
a
local
minimum
,
but
it
's
not
the
definition
of
a
local
minimum
.
and
not
every
local
minimum
arises
in
that
exact
way
.
what
a
local
minimum
means
is
just
that
no
nearby
output
value
is
smaller
than
that
local
minimum
value
.
