1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,641
[MUSIC] If we care about extreme values, 
it would really help to know how to find 

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,924
them. 
We can use a theorem, a theorem of 

3
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:12,800
Fermat. 
Here's Fermat's theorem. 

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,792
Suppose f is a function and it's defined 
on the interval between a and b. 

5
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:24,330
c, is some point in this interval, this 
backwards e, means that c is in this 

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,153
interval. 
Okay, so that's the set up. 

7
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:31,520
Here's Fermat's Theorem. 
If f(c) is an extreme value of the 

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,684
function f, and the function is 
differentiable at the point c, then the 

9
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:42,557
derivitive vanishes at the point c. 
It's actually easier to show something 

10
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:46,864
slightly different. 
So, instead of dealing with this, I'm 

11
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:52,917
going to deal with a different statement. 
Same setup as before, but now I'm going 

12
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:57,299
to try to show that if f is 
differentiable at point c and the 

13
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,692
derivative is nonzero, then f(c) is not 
an extreme value. 

14
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:06,536
It's worth thinking a little bit about 
the relationship between the original 

15
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:11,764
statement where I'm starting off with the 
claim that f(c) is an extreme value and 

16
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:14,779
then concluding that the derivative 
vanishes. 

17
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:19,577
And here, I'm beginning, by assuming the 
derivative doesn't vanish and then 

18
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:22,562
concluding that f(c) is not an extreme 
value. 

19
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,500
This is the thing that I want to try to 
prove now. 

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,079
Why is that theorem true? I'm going to 
get some intuitive idea as to why this is 

21
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,741
true. 
Why is it that if you differentiable a 

22
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,253
point c with nonzero derivative there, 
then f(c) isn't an extreme value? Well, 

23
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,682
to get a sense of this, let's take a look 
at this graph. 

24
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:43,572
Here, I've drawn a graph of some random 
function. 

25
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:46,694
I've picked some point and f'(c) is not 
zero. 

26
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:49,930
Differentiable there, but the 
derivative's nonzero. 

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,316
It's negative. 
Now, what does that mean? That means if I 

28
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:57,098
wiggle the input a little bit, I actually 
do affect the output. 

29
00:01:57,098 --> 00:02:00,195
If I increase the input a bit, the output 
goes down. 

30
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:03,160
If I decrease the input a bit, the output 
goes up. 

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,959
Consequently, that can't be an extreme 
value. 

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,914
That's not the biggest or the smallest 
value when I plug in inputs near c, and 

33
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,766
that's exactly what this statement is 
saying. 

34
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:18,568
If the derivative is not zero, that means 
I do have some control over the output if 

35
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:22,955
I change the input a little bit. 
That means this output isn't an extreme 

36
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:27,793
value because I can make the output 
bigger or smaller with small pervations 

37
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:31,956
to the input. 
I'd like to have a more formal, a more 

38
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:36,416
rigorous argument for this. 
So, let's suppose that f is 

39
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,539
differentiable at c, and the derivative 
is equal to L, L some nonzero number. 

40
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,562
Now, what that really means from the 
definition of derivative is that the 

41
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:53,717
limit of f(c+h)-f(c)/h as h approaches 
zero is equal to L. 

42
00:02:53,717 --> 00:03:01,299
Now, what does this limit say? 
Well, the limit's saying that if h is 

43
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:10,561
near enough zero, I can make this 
difference quotient as close as I like to 

44
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:15,522
L. 
In particular, I can guarantee that 

45
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:26,317
f(c+h)-f(c)/h is between 1/2L and 3/2L. 
Notice what just happened. So, I started 

46
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:30,949
with infinitesimal information. 
I'm just starting with a limit as h 

47
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:34,493
approaches zero. 
And I've promoted this infinitesimal 

48
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:39,657
information to local information. 
Now I know that this difference quotient 

49
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:43,933
is between these two numbers as long as h 
is close enough to zero. 

50
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:48,567
Now, we can continue the proof. 
So, I know that if h is close enough to 

51
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:53,467
zero, this difference quotion is between 
1/2L and 3/2L, 

52
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:58,292
I'm going to multiply all this by h. 
What do I find out then? Then, I find out 

53
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:09,057
that if h is near enough zero, 
multiplying all this by h, I find that 

54
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:18,411
f(c+h)-f(c)/h*h is between 1/2hL and 
3/2hL. 

55
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:23,586
I get from here to here just by 
multiplying by h. 

56
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:29,161
Now, what can I do? Well, I can add f(c) 
to all of this. 

57
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:37,202
And I'll find out that if h is near 
enough zero, then f(c+h) is between 

58
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:42,267
1/2hL+f(c) and 3/2hL+f(c). 
Okay. 

59
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:50,448
So, this is what we've shown. We've shown 
that if h is small enough, f(c+h) is 

60
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:56,327
between these two numbers. 
Now, why would you care? Well, think 

61
00:04:56,327 --> 00:05:00,135
about some possibilities. 
What if L is positive? 

62
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:06,192
If L is positive and h is some small but 
positive number, this is telling me that 

63
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:12,600
f(c+h), being between these two numbers, 
f(c+h) is in particular bigger than f(c). 

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,452
That means that f(c) can't be a local 
maximum. 

65
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:20,278
Same kind of game. 
What if L is positive but I picked h to 

66
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,152
be negative but real close to zero. 
Then, f(c+h) being between these two 

67
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:28,791
numbers, f(c+h) must actually be less 
than f(c). 

68
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,093
That means that f(c) can't be a local 
minimum. 

69
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:35,029
You play the same game when L is 
negative. 

70
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:39,763
Let's summarize what we've shown. 
So, what we've shown is this. 

71
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:45,443
We've shown that if a differentiable 
function has nonzero derivative at the 

72
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:48,588
point c, then f(c) is not an extreme 
value. 

73
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:54,040
And we can play this in reverse. That 
means that if f(c) is a local extrema, 

74
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,933
right? If f(c) is an extreme value, then 
either the derivative doesn't exist to 

75
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:05,403
prevent this first case from happening, 
where f is differentiable at c, or the 

76
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:10,795
derivatives equal to zero, which prevents 
this second thing, f'(c) being nonzero. 

77
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:14,424
So, this is another way to summarize what 
we've done. 

78
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:19,692
If f(c) is a local extremum, then one of 
these two possibilities occurs. 

79
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:25,866
Both of these possibilities do occur. 
Here's the graph of the absolute value 

80
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:29,847
function. 
There's a local and a global minimum at 

81
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,530
the point zero. 
The derivative of this function isn't 

82
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,395
defined at that point. 
Here's another example. 

83
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:42,206
Here's the graph of y=x^2. 
This function also has a local and a 

84
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:46,318
global minimum at the point zero. 
Here, the derivative is defined but the 

85
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,655
derivative is equal to zero at this 
point. 

86
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:53,320
We'll often want to talk about these two 
cases together, the situation where the 

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,819
derivative doesn't exist and the 
situation where the derivative vanishes. 

88
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,282
Let's give it a name to this phenomenon. 
Here we go. If either the derivative at c 

89
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:09,337
doesn't exist, meaning the function's not 
differentiable at c, or the derivative is 

90
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:14,722
equal to zero, then I'm going to call the 
point c a critical point for the function 

91
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:17,587
f. 
This is a great definition because it 

92
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:22,092
fits so well into Fermats theorem. 
Here's another way to say Fermot's 

93
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,812
Theorem. 
Suppose f is a function as defined in 

94
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:29,227
this interval and c is contained in 
there, then if f(c) is an extreme value 

95
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,907
of f, 
well, we know that one of two 

96
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:34,912
possibilities must occur. 
At that point, either the function's not 

97
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,387
differentiable, or the derivative's equal 
to zero. 

98
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,812
And that's exactly what we mean when I 
say that c is a critical point of f. 

99
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:46,106
So, giving a name to this phenomena gives 
us a really nice way of stating Fermat's 

100
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:48,623
Theorem. 
The upshot is that if you want to find 

101
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:52,193
extreme values for a function, you don't 
have to look everywhere. 

102
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:56,058
You only have to look at the critical 
points where the derivative either 

103
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,454
doesn't exist or the derivative vanishes. 
and you should probably also worry about 

104
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,412
the end points. 
In other words, if you're trying to find 

105
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,697
rain, you should just be looking for 
clouds. 

106
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:08,797
You just have to check the cloudy days to 
see if it's raining. 

107
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:12,877
In this same way, if you're looking for 
extreme values, you only need to look for 

108
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:16,742
the critical points because an extreme 
value gives you a critical point. 

109
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:20,860
So, this is a super concrete example. 
Here's a function, y=x^3-x. 

110
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,577
I've graphed this function. 
I'm going to try to find these local 

111
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:29,282
extrema, this local maximum and this 
local minimum, using the machinery that 

112
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:32,421
we've set up. 
So, if I'm looking for local extrema, I 

113
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:36,444
should be looking for critical points. 
So, here's the function, f(x)=x^3-x. 

114
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,066
I'm looking for for critical points in 
this function. 

115
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:46,148
Those are points whose derivative doesn't 
exist, function is not differentiable, or 

116
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:49,874
the derivative vanishes. 
But this function is differentiable 

117
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:52,219
everywhere. 
Its derivative is 3x^2-1. 

118
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:57,032
So, the only critical points are going to 
be where the derivative is equal to zero, 

119
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:00,037
right? 
I'm looking for solutions to 3x^2-1=0. 

120
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,792
I'll write one to both sides, 3x^2=1, so 
I am trying to solve. 

121
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,261
I'll divide both sides by 3, 
x^2=1/3. 

122
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:14,102
So, I am trying to solve. 
Take the square root of both sides. 

123
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:21,115
x is plus or minus the square root of a 
third, which is about 0.577. 

124
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:25,017
And that let's me find these critical 
points, 

125
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:29,547
right? 
These are places where the derivative is 

126
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:34,257
equal to zero. 
The tangent line is horizontal and now I 

127
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:38,287
know the x coordinate of these two red 
points. 

128
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:46,142
Here, are the x coordinates about 0.577, 
and here the x coordinate is -0.577, 

129
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:46,680
about.
