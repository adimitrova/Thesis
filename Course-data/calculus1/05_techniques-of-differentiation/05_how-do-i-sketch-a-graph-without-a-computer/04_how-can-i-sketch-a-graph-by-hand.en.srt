00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,512
[MUSIC] Suppose I've got some function 
given by a rule and I want to make a 

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:10,307
graph of that function. 
I wanted to plot say this function f(x) 

3
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:13,557
equals 2x cubed minus 3x squared minus 
12. 

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:17,342
First thing I might do is just plug in 
some values. 

5
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:21,384
All right I'll pick. 
Pick some inputs and I'll see what the 

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:26,248
function outputs at those inputs. 
And once I've got this table of values, I 

7
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:31,331
could then plot those points on a graph. 
The issue is, how do I really know what 

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:36,123
happens between these points that I 
plotted on the graph? How do I know the 

9
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:41,275
graph isn't doing some crazy wiggling in 
between? How do I know that I've really 

10
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:46,792
picked enough input points to really get 
a good idea of what this graph is doing? 

11
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:51,545
We're going to use derivatives to make 
sure that we're really capturing the 

12
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:56,348
qualitative features of the function. 
I might have been trying to graph a 

13
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:01,253
function, like f(x) equals sin Pi x, and 
if I just plugged in some whole number 

14
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:04,037
inputs, the function would always output 
0. 

15
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:08,708
That might trick me into making a graph 
like this, where I plot 0 as the output 

16
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:13,312
for all these whole number inputs. 
I might, then, be tempted to just fill in 

17
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:16,083
this graph by drawing a straight line 
across. 

18
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:21,039
But that's totally ridiculous, right? 
This graph, you know, actually looks like 

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,744
this. 
Not a horizontal straight line. 

20
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:28,933
There's all kinds of extra wiggling 
that's happening that I missed because I 

21
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:33,286
chose my in points badly. 
We're going to use derivatives to make 

22
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:38,602
sure that we're really capturing the 
qualitative features of the function and 

23
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:41,512
there's a ton of different ways to do 
this. 

24
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:45,402
So let's work this out in one specific 
concrete example. 

25
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:51,021
So let's keep working on the graph of 
this function, f(x) equals 2x cubed minus 

26
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:54,309
3x squared minus 12x. 
First thing I'm going to do is 

27
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:58,921
differentiate this, 
the derivative is 6x^2-6x-12, 

28
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,412
cause' the derivative of 2x^3 is 6x^2, 
the derivative of minus 3x^2 is minus 6x, 

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,223
and the derivative of minus 12x is minus 
12. 

30
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:12,780
There's a common factor of 6 here which I 
can pull out, and then I'm left with this 

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,292
quadratic, and I can factor that 
quadratic into (x+1) times (x-2). 

32
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:22,455
Now once I've got this nice factorized 
version of the derivative, I can then 

33
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:26,429
figure out where the derivative is 
positive and negative. 

34
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:31,491
The derivative is positive when the input 
is more negative than minus and it's 

35
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:34,982
positive when the input is more positive 
than 2. 

36
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:38,457
In between -1 and 2, the derivative is 
negative. 

37
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:42,642
And at the point -1, and at the point 2, 
the derivative is equal to zero. 

38
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:47,317
Now, since this function is 
differentiable everywhere, the only 

39
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:50,582
critical points are where the derivative 
is equal to zero. 

40
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:53,682
These are the critical points, minus 1 
and 2. 

41
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:56,389
Alright. 
So I found the critical points. 

42
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,729
I found the derivative. 
Now, I'll also find the second derivative 

43
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,264
of this function. 
Which I get by differentiating this 

44
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:07,728
derivative. 
If I differentiate 6x^2 I get 12x, if I 

45
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:11,826
differentiate minus 6x I get minus 6, 
and if I differentiate minus 12 I get 

46
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:14,979
zero. 
Again, I've got a common factor of six so 

47
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,915
I'll pull that out and I'm left with 
2x-1. 

48
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:22,348
And now I can think about the SIGN of the 
second derivative. 

49
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:27,933
And what do I know about that? Well, the 
second derivative is negative if I plug 

50
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:33,335
in an x value which is less than 1/2 and 
the second derivative is positive if I 

51
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:36,542
plug in an x value which is bigger than 
1/2. 

52
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:41,310
All right, now I know a lot of 
information about the SIGN of the first 

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,730
and the second derivative, so I can use 
this information to say something about 

54
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,515
the function. 
Let me look back to my preliminary graph 

55
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:54,222
that I made with just plugging in a few 
points. 

56
00:03:54,222 --> 00:04:00,066
All right, so here I plugged in a few 
points and what I'd like to be able to 

57
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:04,891
say now is where is the function 
increasing and decreasing. 

58
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:10,999
And by looking at the sign of the first 
derivative I know that the function's 

59
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,932
increasing, decreasing, and then 
increasing. 

60
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:19,103
Minus 1 and 2 are my critical point and 
in fact, they're local extrema. 

61
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:24,323
This is a local maximum value, and this 
is a local minimum value down here, and I 

62
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:29,053
can also see that by considering the 
information given in the sine of the 

63
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:32,976
second derivative. 
Since the second derivative's negative 

64
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:37,555
here, the functions concave down. 
And since the second derivative is 

65
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:40,485
positive over here, the function is 
concave up. 

66
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:44,880
And that makes this point into a local 
maximum and this point into a local 

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,609
minimum. 
Alright, now that I've got all that 

68
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,376
information I can try to just fix the 
graph here filling it in. 

69
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:55,737
So let's see, so I've got these points 
here and what do I know? I know the 

70
00:04:55,737 --> 00:05:01,412
function is increasing here, and now I 
know that it's decreasing here. 

71
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:05,377
And I know that it's concaved down in 
this region. 

72
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:09,522
Over the rest of the graph the rest 
concave up. 

73
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:15,797
There's an inflection point here when 
x=1/2 and this point over here is a local 

74
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:20,469
minumum. 
The function's decreasing by looking at 

75
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:26,470
the sign of the first derivative, until I 
get to two. 

76
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,633
And then when I get to two, the first 
derivative tells me the function's 

77
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,844
increasing. 
So there we go, 

78
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:43,242
I've drawn a graph of my function. 
The point here is not to capture a 

79
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,758
perfect picture of the function. 
It's like an impressionistic painting, 

80
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:51,805
the point is to capture all of the 
meaning all of the emotion of the 

81
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,954
function. 
Compare that to a photograph which might 

82
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,445
be a perfectly accurate portrayal, but 
somehow misses everything that's 

83
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:02,608
essential. 
So here's the graph that I drew in red, 

84
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:07,166
and here is a more perfect graph 
admittedly, that the soulless robot drew. 

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,238
And you'll see that my graph really is 
just as good. 

86
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:15,035
I mean, it captures all the qualitative 
information which is really what a human 

87
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:19,047
being cares about. 
Functions increasing, decreasing, 

88
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:22,307
increasing. 
You can see where it's concave down and 

89
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:25,967
where it's concave up. 
And you can kind of see roughly where 

90
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,262
this function crosses the x axis. 
Let's summarize the situation. 

91
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:34,890
There's really 4 basic pieces that you're 
just gluing together when you're doing a 

92
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,047
lot of these curve sketching problems. 
It depends on the SIGN of the first 

93
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,963
derivative, and the SIGN of the second 
derivative. 

94
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:46,430
If the derivative is positive, and the 
second derivative is positive, then the 

95
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,992
function is increasing, and the slopes of 
the tangent lines are increasing. 

96
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:55,397
If the function's derivative is negative 
but the second derivative is positive, 

97
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:59,537
that means although the function's 
decreasing, the slopes of those tangent 

98
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:03,027
lines are increasing. 
We've got kind of complementary pictures 

99
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:07,467
over here when the second derivative's 
negative, here the function's increasing 

100
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:12,007
but the slopes of those tangent lines are 
decreasing, and here both the function is 

101
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:15,522
decreasing and the slopes of the tangent 
lines are decreasing. 

102
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:20,558
A lot of the curve sketching problems 
amount to just gluing together these four 

103
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,826
basic pieces in the appropriate way.
