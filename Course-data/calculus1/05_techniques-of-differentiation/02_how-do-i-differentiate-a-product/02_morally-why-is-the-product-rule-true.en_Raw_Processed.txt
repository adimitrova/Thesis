weve used product rule to calculate 
derivatives 
weve even seen a proof using limits, 
theres still this nagging question, 
instance, is there this 
sign in product rule i mean, really, 
chiastic laws, limit 
a sum is sum limits, limit 
products is product limits, 
youd probably think derivative a 
product is product 
derivatives, i mean, you think that if 
you differentiated a product, itd 
product derivatives 
no, 
thats products work 
happens you wiggle terms in 
a product we explore this 
numerically, 
so play around this 
ive got a number a another number b, 
im multiplying together to get 
new number, ab 
initially, ive said a b, so 
ab 
i wiggle terms see 
that affects output 
so if i take a move to 
well, that affects output, 
output is 
conversely if i move that back 
i move b to well, that 
makes output to 
deal here is that wiggling input 
affects output a magnitude thats 
related to size number, 
right i went to , 
output affected three times 
much, 
i moved a to a , 
output affected two times 
much affects add together 
if i simultaneously move a to 
move b to , 
output is , is close to 
is you guessed answer 
would if you add together 
effects 
we see thing geometrically 
geometrically, product is really 
measuring an area 
so let start a rectangle base 
fx height gx 
product fx gx is 
area this rectangle 
now, i want to know this area is 
affected i wiggle x to say xh 
so lets suppose that i that 
lets suppose that i slightly change 
size rectangle, so that 
base isnt fx anymore, fxh 
height isnt gx more, 
gxh 
now, area change 
input goes x to xh 
well, thats exactly computing this 
area this lshaped region here 
i that approximately 
i actually know much base changes 
approximately, using derivative, 
right whats this length here 
approximately well, derivative f 
x times input change is an 
approximation to much output 
changes i go x to xh 
so this distance is approximately f prime 
x times h 
deal here 
input goes x to xh, 
output is changed approximately 
derivative times input change, 
so this length here is g prime x 
times h 
now, im trying to compute area 
this lshaped region to figure 
area, product changes i go 
x to xh 
let cut this lshaped region 
three pieces 
this corner piece is pretty small, so im 
going to end disregarding that corner 
piece 
lets look two big 
pieces here 
this piece here is a rectangle whats 
area well, base is fx 
height is g prime x times h 
so area this piece, is fx times 
g prime x times h 
whats area this rectangle 
here well, base is f prime x 
times h height is gx, so 
area this piece is f prime x g x 
times h now, i want to know 
area change i went x to xh 
well, thats pretty close to the, sum 
two rectangles 
so change in area is f x 
times g prime x times h plus f prime 
x times g x times h 
derivative is ratio output 
change, is this, to input 
change, in this case is h 
i went x to xh 
so now, i cancel hs, 
im left is f x times g 
prime x plus f prime x times g x 
thats product rule 
thats change in area this 
rectangle i went x to xh 
divided much i changed input 
h 
power rule isnt something that we 
made 
sort sinister calculus 
plot designed to turn mathematical 
dreams nightmares 
this rule, product rule, arises 
understandable reasons 
if you wiggle one terms in a 
product, effect product to 
size term 
you add together two effects 
you idea to 
product changes based terms 
change 
this is a rule to 
memorize 
that a algorithm to apply 
product rule is telling you something 
deep a product is effected 
terms changed
