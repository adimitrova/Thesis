[music] we can drive the product rule by  just going back, to the definition of  derivative.
so what is the definition of derivative  say?
it tell us that the derivative of  the product of f of x and g of x is a  limit.
it's the limit as h approaches zero.
of the function at x+h, which, in this  case, is the product of f and g, both  evaluated at x+h, because i'm thinking of  this as the function, so i'm plugging in  x+h, and i subtract the function  evaluated at x, which is just f(x)*g(x),  and then i divide that by h.  so, it's this limit of this difference  quotient, that gives me the derivative of  the product.
how can i evaluate that limit?
here's the  trick, i'm going to add a disguised  version of zero to this limit.
instead of just calculating the limit of  f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x), i'm going to  subtract and add the same thing.
so here, i've got f(x+h)*g(x+h), just  like up here.
now i'm going to just subtract  f(x+h)*g(x+h), and then add it back in,  plus f(x+h)*g(x).
this is just zero,  i haven't done anything.
and i'm going to subtract f(x)*g(x) right  here and i'm still dividing by h.  so these are the same limits,  i haven't really done anything, but i've  actually done everything i need.
by introducing these extra factors, i've  now got a common factor of f(x+h) here  and a common factor of g(x) here.
so, i can collect those out and i'll get  some good things happening as a result.
let's see exactly how this happens.
so this is the limit as h goes to zero,  i'm going to pull out that common factor  of f(x+h) [sound].
and i'm going to multiply by what's left  over g(x+h)-g(x) [sound] and i can put it  over h.  so that's these two terms.
now, what's left over here?
i've got a  common factor of g(x).
and what's left over?
f(x+h)-f(x) i'll  divide this by h,  and then the factor i pull out is g(x).
so this limit is the same as this limit.
now this is a limit of a sum.
so that's a sum of the limits provided  the limits exist and we'll see that they  do.
so this is the limit as h goes to zero of  f(x+h)*g(x+h)-g(x)/h plus the lim as h  goes to zero of f(x+h)-f(x)/h*g(x).
now what do i have here i've got limits  of products which are the products of  limits providing the limits exist, and  they do and we'll see, so let's rewrite  these limits of products as products of  limits.
this is the limit as h goes to zero of  f(x+h) times the limit as h goes to zero  of g(x+h)-g(x)/h.
you might begin to see what's happening  here,  plus the limit as h goes to zero of  f(x+h)-f(x)/h times the limit as h goes  to zero of g(x).
okay,  now we've got to check that all these  limits exist, in order to justify  replacing limits [inaudible] limits.
but these limits do exist,  let's see why?
this first limit, the limit of f(x+h) as  h goes to zero, it's actually the hardest  one i think, of all these to see.
remember back, we showed that  differentiable functions are continuous.
this is really calculating the limit of f  of something, as the something approaches  x.  and that's really what this limit is, and  because f is continuous, because f is  differentiable, this limit is actually  just f(x).
but i think seeing that step is probably  the hardest in this whole argument.
what's this thing here?
well, this is the  limit of the thing that calculates the  derivative of g, and g is differentiable  by assumption.
so, this is the derivative of g at x  plus, what's this limit?
this is the  limit that calculates the derivative of  f, and f is differentiable by assumption,  so that's f (x)'.
this is the limit of g(x), as h goes to  zero.
this is the limit of a constant.
wiggling h doesn't affect this at all, so  that's just g(x).
and look at what we've calculated here.
the limit that calculates the derivative  of the product is f(x)*g'(x)+f'(x)*g,  that is the product rule.
what have we really shown here?
well,  here is one way to write down the product  rule very precisely.
confusingly, i'm going to define a new  function that i'm calling h.  so h is just the product of f and g now,  h(x)=f(x)*g(x).
if f and g are differentiable at some  point, a, then i know the derivative of  their product.
the derivative of their product is the  derivative of f times the value of g plus  the value of f times the derivative of g.  this is a precise statement of the  product rule, and you can really see, for  instance, where this differentiability  condition was necessary.
in our proof, at some point in the proof  here, i wanted to go from a limit of a  product to the product of limits.
but in order to do that, i need to know  that this limit exists.
and that limit is exactly calculating the  derivative of g.  so you can really see where these  conditions are playing a crucial role in  the proof of the product rule.
