[music] what's the derivative of a  product of two functions?
the derivative  of a product is given by this, the  product rule.
the derivative of f times g is the  derivative of f times g plus f times the  derivative of g.  it's a bunch of things to be warned about  here.
this is the product of two functions, but  the derivative involves the sum of two  different products.
it's the derivative of the first times  the second plus the first times the  derivative of the second.
let's see an example of this rule in  action.
for example, let's work out the  derivative of this product, the product  of 1+2x and 1+x^2.
alright, well here we go.
this is a  derivative of product, so by the product  rule, i'm going to differentiate the  first thing, multiply by the second, and  add that to the first thing times the  derivative of the second.
so, it's the derivative of the first term  in the product times the second term in  the product, derivative of the first  function times the second, plus the first  function, 1+2x, times the derivative of  the second.
so, that's an instance of the product  rule.
now, this is the derivative of a sum,  which is the sum of the derivatives.
so, it's the derivative of 1 plus the  derivative of 2x times 1+x^2 plus 1+2x  times the derivative of a sum, which is  the sum of the derivatives.
now, the derivative of 1, that's a  derivative of a constant function that's  just 0,  this is the derivative of a constant  multiple so i can pull that constant  multiple out of the derivative,  times 1+x^2+1+2x times, the derivative of  1 is 0,  it's the derivative of a constant, plus  the derivative of x^2 is 2x.
alright.
now, i've got 0+2 times the derivative of  x.  the derivative of x is just 1.  so, that's just  2*1*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*(0+2x).
so, there it is.
i could maybe write this a little bit  more neatly.
2*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*2x.
this is the derivative of our original  function (1+2x)*(1+x^2).
we din't really need the product rule to  compute that derivative.
so, instead of using the product rule on  this, i'm going to first multiply this  out and then do the differentiation.
here, watch.
so, this is the derivative but i'm going  to multiply all this out, alright?
so,  1+2x^3, which is what i get when i  multiply 2x by x^2, plus x^2, which is  1*x^2+2x*1.  so now, i could differentiate this  without using the product rule, right?
this is the derivatives of big sum,  so it's the sum of the derivatives.
the derivative of one, the derivative of  2x^3, the derivative of x^2, and the  derivative of 2x.
now, the derivative of 1, that's the  derivative of a constant,  that's just 0.  the derivative of this constant multiple  of x^3, i can pull out the constant  multiple.
the derivative of x^2 is 2x and the  derivative of 2-x, so i can pull out the  constant multiple.
now, what's 2 times the derivative of  x^3?
that's 2 times, the derivative of  x^3 is 3x^2+2x+2 times the derivative of  x, which is 2*1.  and then, i could write this maybe a  little bit more nicely.
this is 6x^2+2x+2.
so, this is the derivative of our  original function.
woah.
what just happened?
i'm trying to  differentiate 1+2x*1+x^2.
when i just used the product rule, i got  this, 2*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*(2x).
when i expanded and then differentiated,  i got this,  6x^2+2x+2.
so, are these two answers the same?
yeah.
these two answers are the same.
let's see how.
i can expand out this first answer.
this is 2*1+2x^2+1*2x plus 2x*2x is 4x^2.
now look,  2, 2x^2+4x^2 gives me 6x^2.
and 1*2x gives me this 2x here.
these are, in fact, the same.
should we really be surprised by this?
i  mean, i did do these things in a  different order.
so, in this first case, i differentiated  using the product rule and then i  expanded what i got.
in the second case, first, i expanded and  after doing expansion, then i  differentiated.
more succintly in the first case, i  differentiated than expanded.
in the  second case, i expanded then i  differentiated.
look, you'd think the order would matter.
usually, the order does matter.
if you take a shower and then get  dressed, that's a totally different  experience from getting dressed and then  stepping into the shower.
the order usually does matter and you'd  think that differentiating and then  expanding would do something really  different than expanding and then  differentiating.
but you've got real choices when you do  these derivative calculations, and yet  somehow, mathematics is conspiring so  that we can all agree on the derivative,  no matter what choices we might make on  our way there.
and i think we can also all agree that  that's pretty cool.
