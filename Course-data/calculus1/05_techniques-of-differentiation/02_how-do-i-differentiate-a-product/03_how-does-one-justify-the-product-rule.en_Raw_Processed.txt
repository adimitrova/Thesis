music we drive product rule 
going back, to definition 
derivative 
so is definition derivative 
say tell us that derivative 
product f x g x is a 
limit 
limit h approaches zero 
function xh, which, in this 
case, is product f g, 
evaluated xh, im thinking 
this function, so im plugging in 
xh, i subtract function 
evaluated x, is fxgx, 
i divide that h 
so, this limit this difference 
quotient, that gives derivative 
product 
i evaluate that limit heres 
trick, im going to add a disguised 
version zero to this limit 
instead calculating limit 
fxhgxhfxgx, im going to 
subtract add thing 
so here, ive got fxhgxh, 
like here 
im going to subtract 
fxhgxh, add back in, 
plus fxhgx 
this is zero, 
i havent done anything 
im going to subtract fxgx right 
here im still dividing h 
so limits, 
i havent really done anything, ive 
actually done everything i need 
introducing extra factors, ive 
got a common factor fxh here 
a common factor gx here 
so, i collect ill get 
good things happening a result 
lets see exactly this happens 
so this is limit h goes to zero, 
im going to pull that common factor 
fxh sound 
im going to multiply whats left 
gxhgx sound i put 
h 
so thats two terms 
now, whats left here ive got a 
common factor gx 
whats left fxhfx ill 
divide this h, 
factor i pull is gx 
so this limit is this limit 
this is a limit a sum 
so thats a sum limits provided 
limits exist well see that 

so this is limit h goes to zero 
fxhgxhgxh plus lim h 
goes to zero fxhfxhgx 
i here ive got limits 
products products 
limits providing limits exist, 
well see, so lets rewrite 
limits products products 
limits 
this is limit h goes to zero 
fxh times limit h goes to zero 
gxhgxh 
you might begin to see whats happening 
here, 
plus limit h goes to zero 
fxhfxh times limit h goes 
to zero gx 
okay, 
weve got to check that 
limits exist, in order to justify 
replacing limits inaudible limits 
limits exist, 
lets see 
this first limit, limit fxh 
h goes to zero, actually hardest 
one i think, to see 
remember back, we showed that 
differentiable functions continuous 
this is really calculating limit f 
something, something approaches 
x 
thats really this limit is, 
f is continuous, f is 
differentiable, this limit is actually 
fx 
i think seeing that step is probably 
hardest in this whole argument 
whats this thing here well, this is 
limit thing that calculates 
derivative g, g is differentiable 
assumption 
so, this is derivative g x 
plus, whats this limit this is 
limit that calculates derivative 
f, f is differentiable assumption, 
so thats f x 
this is limit gx, h goes to 
zero 
this is limit a constant 
wiggling h doesnt affect this all, so 
thats gx 
look weve calculated here 
limit that calculates derivative 
product is fxgxfxg, 
that is product rule 
we really shown here well, 
here is one way to write product 
rule precisely 
confusingly, im going to define a new 
function that im calling h 
so h is product f g now, 
hxfxgx 
if f g differentiable 
point, a, i know derivative 
product 
derivative product is 
derivative f times value g plus 
value f times derivative g 
this is a precise statement 
product rule, you really see, 
instance, this differentiability 
condition necessary 
in proof, point in proof 
here, i wanted to go a limit a 
product to product limits 
in order to that, i need to know 
that this limit exists 
that limit is exactly calculating 
derivative g 
so you really see 
conditions playing a crucial role in 
proof product rule
