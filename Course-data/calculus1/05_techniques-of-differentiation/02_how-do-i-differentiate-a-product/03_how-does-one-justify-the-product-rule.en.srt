00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,644
[MUSIC] We can drive the product rule by 
just going back, to the definition of 

2
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:12,841
derivative. 
So what is the definition of derivative 

3
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:19,807
say? It tell us that the derivative of 
the product of f of x and g of x is a 

4
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:23,812
limit. 
It's the limit as h approaches zero. 

5
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:29,607
Of the function at x+h, which, in this 
case, is the product of f and g, both 

6
00:00:29,607 --> 00:00:35,650
evaluated at x+h, because I'm thinking of 
this as the function, so I'm plugging in 

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:41,507
x+h, and I subtract the function 
evaluated at x, which is just f(x)*g(x), 

8
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:46,605
and then I divide that by h. 
So, it's this limit of this difference 

9
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:50,896
quotient, that gives me the derivative of 
the product. 

10
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:56,664
How can I evaluate that limit? Here's the 
trick, I'm going to add a disguised 

11
00:00:56,664 --> 00:01:02,206
version of zero to this limit. 
Instead of just calculating the limit of 

12
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:07,852
f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x), I'm going to 
subtract and add the same thing. 

13
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:11,749
So here, I've got f(x+h)*g(x+h), just 
like up here. 

14
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,698
Now I'm going to just subtract 
f(x+h)*g(x+h), and then add it back in, 

15
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:19,260
plus f(x+h)*g(x). 
This is just zero, 

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,904
I haven't done anything. 
And I'm going to subtract f(x)*g(x) right 

17
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:28,152
here and I'm still dividing by h. 
So these are the same limits, 

18
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:33,090
I haven't really done anything, but I've 
actually done everything I need. 

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,548
By introducing these extra factors, I've 
now got a common factor of f(x+h) here 

20
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:44,101
and a common factor of g(x) here. 
So, I can collect those out and I'll get 

21
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:49,768
some good things happening as a result. 
Let's see exactly how this happens. 

22
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:55,342
So this is the limit as h goes to zero, 
I'm going to pull out that common factor 

23
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:59,774
of f(x+h) [SOUND]. 
And I'm going to multiply by what's left 

24
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:05,550
over g(x+h)-g(x) [SOUND] and I can put it 
over h. 

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,968
So that's these two terms. 
Now, what's left over here? I've got a 

26
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:20,195
common factor of g(x). 
And what's left over? f(x+h)-f(x) I'll 

27
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:25,496
divide this by h, 
and then the factor I pull out is g(x). 

28
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:31,587
So this limit is the same as this limit. 
Now this is a limit of a sum. 

29
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:38,643
So that's a sum of the limits provided 
the limits exist and we'll see that they 

30
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:45,353
do. 
So this is the limit as h goes to zero of 

31
00:02:45,353 --> 00:03:00,802
f(x+h)*g(x+h)-g(x)/h plus the lim as h 
goes to zero of f(x+h)-f(x)/h*g(x). 

32
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:08,033
Now what do I have here I've got limits 
of products which are the products of 

33
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:13,178
limits providing the limits exist, and 
they do and we'll see, so let's rewrite 

34
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:16,372
these limits of products as products of 
limits. 

35
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:24,702
This is the limit as h goes to zero of 
f(x+h) times the limit as h goes to zero 

36
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:31,883
of g(x+h)-g(x)/h. 
You might begin to see what's happening 

37
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:35,385
here, 
plus the limit as h goes to zero of 

38
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:40,479
f(x+h)-f(x)/h times the limit as h goes 
to zero of g(x). 

39
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,581
Okay, 
now we've got to check that all these 

40
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:51,408
limits exist, in order to justify 
replacing limits [INAUDIBLE] limits. 

41
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:55,442
But these limits do exist, 
let's see why? 

42
00:03:55,442 --> 00:04:00,734
This first limit, the limit of f(x+h) as 
h goes to zero, it's actually the hardest 

43
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:04,747
one I think, of all these to see. 
Remember back, we showed that 

44
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:09,987
differentiable functions are continuous. 
This is really calculating the limit of f 

45
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,682
of something, as the something approaches 
x. 

46
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:17,772
And that's really what this limit is, and 
because f is continuous, because f is 

47
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:20,817
differentiable, this limit is actually 
just f(x). 

48
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:25,372
But I think seeing that step is probably 
the hardest in this whole argument. 

49
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:31,209
What's this thing here? Well, this is the 
limit of the thing that calculates the 

50
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,445
derivative of g, and g is differentiable 
by assumption. 

51
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:40,047
So, this is the derivative of g at x 
plus, what's this limit? This is the 

52
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:44,700
limit that calculates the derivative of 
f, and f is differentiable by assumption, 

53
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,903
so that's f (x)'. 
This is the limit of g(x), as h goes to 

54
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:50,075
zero. 
This is the limit of a constant. 

55
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:53,592
Wiggling h doesn't affect this at all, so 
that's just g(x). 

56
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:58,906
And look at what we've calculated here. 
The limit that calculates the derivative 

57
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:04,082
of the product is f(x)*g'(x)+f'(x)*g, 
that is the product rule. 

58
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:09,204
What have we really shown here? Well, 
here is one way to write down the product 

59
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:12,777
rule very precisely. 
Confusingly, I'm going to define a new 

60
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:16,791
function that I'm calling h. 
So h is just the product of f and g now, 

61
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,111
h(x)=f(x)*g(x). 
If f and g are differentiable at some 

62
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,406
point, a, then I know the derivative of 
their product. 

63
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,827
The derivative of their product Is the 
derivative of f times the value of g plus 

64
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,242
the value of f times the derivative of g. 
This is a precise statement of the 

65
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:37,447
product rule, and you can really see, for 
instance, where this differentiability 

66
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:41,577
condition was necessary. 
In our proof, at some point in the proof 

67
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:46,017
here, I wanted to go from a limit of a 
product to the product of limits. 

68
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:49,922
But in order to do that, I need to know 
that this limit exists. 

69
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:56,273
And that limit is exactly calculating the 
derivative of G. 

70
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:04,187
So you can really see where these 
conditions are playing a crucial role in 

71
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:08,343
the proof of the product rule.
