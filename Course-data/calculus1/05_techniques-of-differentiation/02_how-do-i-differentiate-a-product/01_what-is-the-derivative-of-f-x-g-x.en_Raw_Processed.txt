music whats derivative a 
product two functions derivative 
a product is given this, 
product rule 
derivative f times g is 
derivative f times g plus f times 
derivative g 
a bunch things to warned 
here 
this is product two functions, 
derivative involves sum two 
different products 
derivative first times 
second plus first times 
derivative second 
lets see an example this rule in 
action 
example, lets work 
derivative this product, product 
x x 
alright, well here we go this is a 
derivative product, so product 
rule, im going to differentiate 
first thing, multiply second, 
add that to first thing times 
derivative second 
so, derivative first term 
in product times second term in 
product, derivative first 
function times second, plus first 
function, x, times derivative 
second 
so, thats an instance product 
rule 
now, this is derivative a sum, 
is sum derivatives 
so, derivative plus 
derivative x times x plus x 
times derivative a sum, is 
sum derivatives 
now, derivative , thats a 
derivative a constant function thats 
, 
this is derivative a constant 
multiple so i pull that constant 
multiple derivative, 
times xx times, derivative 
is , 
derivative a constant, plus 
derivative x is x 
alright 
now, ive got times derivative 
x 
derivative x is 
so, thats 
xxx 
so, there is 
i could maybe write this a little bit 
neatly 
xxx 
this is derivative original 
function xx 
we dint really need product rule to 
compute that derivative 
so, instead using product rule 
this, im going to first multiply this 
differentiation 
here, watch 
so, this is derivative im going 
to multiply this out, alright so, 
x, is i get i 
multiply x x, plus x, is 
xx 
so now, i could differentiate this 
without using product rule, right 
this is derivatives big sum, 
so sum derivatives 
derivative one, derivative 
x, derivative x, 
derivative x 
now, derivative , thats 
derivative a constant, 
thats 
derivative this constant multiple 
x, i pull constant 
multiple 
derivative x is x 
derivative x, so i pull 
constant multiple 
now, whats times derivative 
x thats times, derivative 
x is xx times derivative 
x, is 
then, i could write this maybe a 
little bit nicely 
this is xx 
so, this is derivative 
original function 
woah happened im trying to 
differentiate xx 
i used product rule, i got 
this, xxx 
i expanded differentiated, 
i got this, 
xx 
so, two answers yeah 
two answers 
lets see 
i expand this first answer 
this is xx plus xx is x 
look, 
, xx gives x 
x gives this x here 
are, in fact, 
we really surprised this i 
mean, i things in a 
different order 
so, in this first case, i differentiated 
using product rule i 
expanded i got 
in second case, first, i expanded 
expansion, i 
differentiated 
succintly in first case, i 
differentiated expanded in 
second case, i expanded i 
differentiated 
look, youd think order would matter 
usually, order matter 
if you take a shower get 
dressed, thats a totally different 
experience getting dressed 
stepping shower 
order usually matter youd 
think that differentiating 
expanding would something really 
different expanding 
differentiating 
youve got real choices you 
derivative calculations, yet 
somehow, mathematics is conspiring so 
that we agree derivative, 
matter choices we might make 
way there 
i think we also agree that 
thats pretty cool 
music
