[MUSIC] What's the derivative of a 
product of two functions? The derivative 

2
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:11,761
of a product is given by this, the 
Product Rule. 

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:18,558
The derivative of f times g is the 
derivative of f times g plus f times the 

4
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:23,236
derivative of g. 
It's a bunch of things to be warned about 

5
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:26,748
here. 
This is the product of two functions, but 

6
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:31,148
the derivative involves the sum of two 
different products. 

7
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:36,561
It's the derivative of the first times 
the second plus the first times the 

8
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:40,821
derivative of the second. 
Let's see an example of this rule in 

9
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,293
action. 
For example, let's work out the 

10
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,943
derivative of this product, the product 
of 1+2x and 1+x^2. 

11
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:52,734
Alright, well here we go. This is a 
derivative of product, so by the Product 

12
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:57,202
Rule, I'm going to differentiate the 
first thing, multiply by the second, and 

13
00:00:57,202 --> 00:01:01,804
add that to the first thing times the 
derivative of the second. 

14
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:08,895
So, it's the derivative of the first term 
in the product times the second term in 

15
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:15,936
the product, derivative of the first 
function times the second, plus the first 

16
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:20,842
function, 1+2x, times the derivative of 
the second. 

17
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,402
So, that's an instance of the Product 
Rule. 

18
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:30,909
Now, this is the derivative of a sum, 
which is the sum of the derivatives. 

19
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,855
So, it's the derivative of 1 plus the 
derivative of 2x times 1+x^2 plus 1+2x 

20
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:42,942
times the derivative of a sum, which is 
the sum of the derivatives. 

21
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:49,678
Now, the derivative of 1, that's a 
derivative of a constant function that's 

22
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:53,636
just 0, 
this is the derivative of a constant 

23
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:59,942
multiple so I can pull that constant 
multiple out of the derivative, 

24
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:04,806
times 1+x^2+1+2x times, the derivative of 
1 is 0, 

25
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:11,066
it's the derivative of a constant, plus 
the derivative of x^2 is 2x. 

26
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:19,914
Alright. 
Now, I've got 0+2 times the derivative of 

27
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:24,012
x. 
The derivative of x is just 1. 

28
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,716
So, that's just 
2*1*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*(0+2x). 

29
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:36,536
So, there it is. 
I could maybe write this a little bit 

30
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:41,331
more neatly. 
2*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*2x. 

31
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:48,448
This is the derivative of our original 
function (1+2x)*(1+x^2). 

32
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:54,842
We din't really need the Product Rule to 
compute that derivative. 

33
00:02:54,842 --> 00:03:00,194
So, instead of using the Product Rule on 
this, I'm going to first multiply this 

34
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:03,913
out and then do the differentiation. 
Here, watch. 

35
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:11,517
So, this is the derivative but I'm going 
to multiply all this out, alright? So, 

36
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:20,775
1+2x^3, which is what I get when I 
multiply 2x by x^2, plus x^2, which is 

37
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:26,832
1*x^2+2x*1. 
So now, I could differentiate this 

38
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:32,502
without using the Product Rule, right? 
This is the derivatives of big sum, 

39
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:38,257
so it's the sum of the derivatives. 
The derivative of one, the derivative of 

40
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:43,532
2x^3, the derivative of x^2, and the 
derivative of 2x. 

41
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:48,042
Now, the derivative of 1, that's the 
derivative of a constant, 

42
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:52,052
that's just 0. 
The derivative of this constant multiple 

43
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:55,447
of x^3, I can pull out the constant 
multiple. 

44
00:03:55,447 --> 00:04:01,412
The derivative of x^2 is 2x and the 
derivative of 2-x, so I can pull out the 

45
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:06,544
constant multiple. 
Now, what's 2 times the derivative of 

46
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:14,804
x^3? That's 2 times, the derivative of 
x^3 is 3x^2+2x+2 times the derivative of 

47
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:20,521
x, which is 2*1. 
And then, I could write this maybe a 

48
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:25,522
little bit more nicely. 
This is 6x^2+2x+2. 

49
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:31,104
So, this is the derivative of our 
original function. 

50
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:37,046
Woah. What just happened? I'm trying to 
differentiate 1+2x*1+x^2. 

51
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:46,899
When I just used the Product Rule, I got 
this, 2*(1+x^2)+(1+2x)*(2x). 

52
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,989
When I expanded and then differentiated, 
I got this, 

53
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:56,990
6x^2+2x+2. 
So, are these two answers the same? Yeah. 

54
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,702
These two answers are the same. 
let's see how. 

55
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,458
I can expand out this first answer. 
This is 2*1+2x^2+1*2x plus 2x*2x is 4x^2. 

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,718
Now look, 
2, 2x^2+4x^2 gives me 6x^2. 

57
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:27,962
And 1*2x gives me this 2x here. 
These are, in fact, the same. 

58
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:33,806
Should we really be surprised by this? I 
mean, I did do these things in a 

59
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:38,545
different order. 
So, in this first case, I differentiated 

60
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:43,055
using the Product Rule and then I 
expanded what I got. 

61
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:48,792
In the second case, first, I expanded and 
after doing expansion, then I 

62
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:52,887
differentiated. 
More succintly in the first case, I 

63
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:58,227
differentiated than expanded. In the 
second case, I expanded then I 

64
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,897
differentiated. 
Look, you'd think the order would matter. 

65
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:05,263
Usually, the order does matter. 
If you take a shower and then get 

66
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:09,308
dressed, that's a totally different 
experience from getting dressed and then 

67
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:12,798
stepping into the shower. 
The order usually does matter and you'd 

68
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:16,644
think that differentiating and then 
expanding would do something really 

69
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,532
different than expanding and then 
differentiating. 

70
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:25,779
But you've got real choices when you do 
these derivative calculations, and yet 

71
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:32,239
somehow, Mathematics is conspiring so 
that we can all agree on the derivative, 

72
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:36,675
no matter what choices we might make on 
our way there. 

73
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:41,462
And I think we can also all agree that 
that's pretty cool. 

74
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:45,787
