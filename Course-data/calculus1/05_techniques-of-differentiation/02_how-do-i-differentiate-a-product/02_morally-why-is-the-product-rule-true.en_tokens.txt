we
've
used
the
product
rule
to
calculate
some
derivatives
.
we
've
even
seen
a
proof
using
limits
,
but
there
's
still
this
nagging
question
,
why
?
for
instance
,
why
is
there
this
+
sign
in
the
product
rule
?
i
mean
,
really
,
with
all
those
chiastic
laws
,
the
limit
of
a
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
,
limit
of
products
is
the
product
of
limits
,
you
'd
probably
think
the
derivative
of
a
product
is
the
product
of
the
derivatives
,
i
mean
,
you
think
that
if
you
differentiated
a
product
,
it
'd
just
be
the
product
of
the
derivatives
.
no
,
that
's
not
how
products
work
.
what
happens
when
you
wiggle
the
terms
in
a
product
?
we
can
explore
this
numerically
,
so
play
around
with
this
.
i
've
got
a
number
a
and
another
number
b
,
and
i
'm
multiplying
them
together
to
get
some
new
number
,
ab
.
initially
,
i
've
said
a=2
and
b=3
,
so
ab=6
.
but
now
i
can
wiggle
the
terms
and
see
how
that
affects
the
output
.
so
what
if
i
take
a
and
move
it
from
2
to
2.1
?
well
,
that
affects
the
output
,
the
output
is
now
6.3.
conversely
what
if
i
move
that
back
down
and
i
move
b
from
3
to
3.1
?
well
,
that
makes
the
output
from
6
to
now
6.2.
the
deal
here
is
that
wiggling
the
input
affects
the
output
by
a
magnitude
that
's
related
to
the
size
of
the
other
number
,
right
?
when
i
went
from
2
to
2.1
,
the
output
was
affected
by
about
three
times
as
much
,
the
3.
when
i
moved
the
3
from
a
3
to
a
3.1
,
the
output
was
affected
by
about
two
times
as
much
and
these
affects
add
together
.
what
if
i
simultaneously
move
a
from
2
to
2.1
and
move
b
from
3
to
3.1
,
then
the
output
is
6.51
,
which
is
close
to
6.5
which
is
what
you
guessed
the
answer
would
be
if
you
just
add
together
these
effects
.
we
can
see
the
same
thing
geometrically
.
geometrically
,
the
product
is
really
measuring
an
area
.
so
let
me
start
with
a
rectangle
of
base
f
(
x
)
and
height
g
(
x
)
.
the
product
of
f
(
x
)
and
g
(
x
)
is
then
the
area
of
this
rectangle
.
now
,
i
want
to
know
how
this
area
is
affected
when
i
wiggle
from
x
to
say
x+h
.
so
lets
suppose
that
i
do
that
.
let
's
suppose
that
i
slightly
change
the
size
of
the
rectangle
,
so
that
now
the
base
is
n't
f
(
x
)
anymore
,
it
's
f
(
x+h
)
and
the
height
is
n't
g
(
x
)
any
more
,
it
's
g
(
x+h
)
.
now
,
how
does
the
area
change
when
the
input
goes
from
x
to
x+h
?
well
,
that
's
exactly
just
computing
this
area
and
this
l-shaped
region
here
.
i
can
do
that
approximately
.
i
actually
know
how
much
the
base
changes
approximately
,
by
using
the
derivative
,
right
?
what
's
this
length
here
approximately
?
well
,
the
derivative
of
f
at
x
times
the
input
change
is
an
approximation
to
how
much
the
output
changes
when
i
go
from
x
to
(
x+h
)
.
so
this
distance
is
approximately
f
prime
of
x
times
h.
same
deal
over
here
.
when
the
input
goes
from
x
to
x+h
,
the
output
is
changed
by
approximately
the
derivative
times
the
input
change
,
so
this
length
here
is
about
g
prime
of
x
times
h.
now
,
i
'm
trying
to
compute
the
area
of
this
l-shaped
region
to
figure
out
how
the
area
,
the
product
changes
when
i
go
from
x
to
x+h
.
let
me
cut
this
l-shaped
region
up
into
three
pieces
.
this
corner
piece
is
pretty
small
,
so
i
'm
going
to
end
up
disregarding
that
corner
piece
.
but
let
's
just
look
at
these
two
big
pieces
here
.
this
piece
here
is
a
rectangle
and
what
's
its
area
?
well
,
its
base
is
f
(
x
)
and
its
height
is
g
prime
of
x
times
h.
so
the
area
of
this
piece
,
is
f
(
x
)
times
g
prime
of
x
times
h.
what
's
the
area
of
this
rectangle
over
here
?
well
,
its
base
is
f
prime
of
x
times
h
and
its
height
is
g
(
x
)
,
so
the
area
of
this
piece
is
f
prime
of
x
g
of
x
times
h
now
,
i
want
to
know
how
did
the
area
change
when
i
went
from
x
to
x+h
?
well
,
that
's
pretty
close
to
the
,
the
sum
of
these
two
rectangles
.
so
the
change
in
area
is
about
f
of
x
times
g
prime
of
x
times
h
plus
f
prime
of
x
times
g
of
x
times
h.
the
derivative
is
the
ratio
of
output
change
,
which
is
about
this
,
to
input
change
,
which
in
this
case
is
h.
i
went
from
x
to
x+h
.
so
now
,
i
can
cancel
these
h
's
,
and
what
i
'm
left
with
is
f
of
x
times
g
prime
of
x
plus
f
prime
x
times
g
of
x.
that
's
the
product
rule
.
that
's
the
change
in
the
area
of
this
rectangle
when
i
went
from
x
to
x+h
divided
by
how
much
i
changed
the
input
h.
the
power
rule
is
n't
something
that
we
just
made
up
.
it
's
not
some
sort
of
sinister
calculus
plot
designed
to
turn
your
mathematical
dreams
into
nightmares
.
this
rule
,
the
product
rule
,
arises
for
understandable
reasons
.
if
you
wiggle
one
of
the
terms
in
a
product
,
the
effect
on
the
product
has
to
do
with
the
size
of
the
other
term
.
you
add
together
these
two
effects
and
then
you
have
some
idea
as
to
how
the
product
changes
based
on
how
the
terms
change
.
this
is
more
than
just
a
rule
to
memorize
.
it
's
more
that
just
a
algorithm
to
apply
.
the
product
rule
is
telling
you
something
deep
about
how
a
product
is
effected
when
it
's
terms
are
changed
.
