.
earlier
we
saw
how
the
sign
,
the
s-i-g-n
,
of
the
derivative
encoded
whether
the
function
was
increasing
or
decreasing
.
thinking
back
to
the
graph
,
here
i
've
just
drawn
some
random
graph
.
what
is
the
derivative
encoding
?
well
here
this
point
a
,
the
slope
of
this
tangent
line
is
negative
,
the
derivative
is
negative
,
and
yeah
,
the
function
's
going
down
here
.
at
this
point
b
,
the
slope
of
this
tangent
line
is
positive
and
the
function
's
increasing
through
here
.
all
right
?
the
derivative
is
negative
here
,
and
it
's
positive
here
.
the
function
's
decreasing
here
,
and
increasing
here
.
so
that
's
what
the
derivative
is
measuring
.
what
is
the
sign
of
the
second
derivative
really
encoding
?
maybe
we
do
n't
have
such
a
good
word
for
it
so
we
'll
just
make
up
a
new
word
.
the
s-i-g-n
,
the
sign
of
the
second
derivative
,
the
sign
of
the
derivative
of
the
derivative
measures
concavity
.
the
word
's
concavity
,
and
here
's
the
two
possibilities
,
concave
up
where
the
second
derivative
is
positive
,
and
concave
down
where
the
second
derivative
is
negative
.
and
i
've
drawn
sort
of
cartoony
pictures
of
what
the
graphs
look
like
in
these
two
cases
.
now
,
note
it
's
not
just
increasing
or
decreasing
,
but
this
concavity
is
recording
sort
of
the
shape
of
the
graph
in
some
sense
.
positive
second
derivative
makes
it
look
like
this
,
negative
second
derivative
makes
the
graph
look
like
this
,
and
i
'm
just
labeling
these
two
things
concave
up
and
concave
down
.
and
this
makes
sense
if
we
think
of
the
second
derivative
as
measuring
the
change
in
the
derivative
.
so
let
's
think
back
to
this
graph
again
.
here
's
this
graph
of
some
random
function
.
look
at
this
part
of
the
graph
right
here
.
that
looks
like
the
concave
up
shape
from
before
,
where
the
second
derivative
was
positive
.
so
we
might
think
that
the
second
derivative
is
positive
here
.
that
would
mean
that
the
derivative
is
increasing
.
what
that
really
means
is
that
the
slope
of
a
tangent
line
through
this
region
is
increasing
.
and
that
's
exactly
what
's
happening
.
the
slope
is
negative
here
,
and
as
i
move
this
tangent
line
over
,
the
slope
of
that
tangent
line
is
increasing
.
the
second
derivative
is
positive
here
.
you
can
tell
yourself
the
same
story
for
concave
down
.
so
look
over
here
in
our
sample
graph
.
that
part
of
the
graph
looks
like
this
concave
down
picture
where
the
second
derivative
's
negative
.
now
,
if
the
second
derivative
is
negative
,
that
means
the
derivative
is
decreasing
.
and
yeah
,
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
through
this
region
is
going
down
,
right
?
the
slope
starts
off
pretty
positive
over
here
,
and
as
i
move
this
tangent
line
over
,
the
slope
is
zero
,
and
now
getting
more
and
more
negative
.
so
in
this
part
of
the
graph
,
the
second
derivative
is
negative
.
what
happens
in
between
?
where
does
the
regime
change
take
place
?
so
over
here
,
the
second
derivative
is
negative
.
over
here
,
the
second
derivative
is
positive
.
there
's
a
point
in
between
,
maybe
it
's
right
here
.
and
at
that
point
the
second
derivative
is
equal
to
zero
.
and
on
one
side
it
's
concave
down
,
and
on
the
other
side
it
's
concave
up
.
a
point
where
the
concavity
actually
changes
is
called
an
inflection
point
.
alright
,
the
,
it
's
concave
down
over
here
,
and
it
's
concave
up
over
here
and
the
place
where
the
change
is
taking
place
,
we
're
going
to
,
just
going
to
call
those
points
inflection
points
.
it
's
not
that
the
terminology
itself
is
so
important
,
but
we
want
words
to
describe
the
qualitative
phenomena
that
we
're
seeing
in
these
graphs
.
inflection
points
are
something
you
can
really
feel
.
i
mean
,
if
you
're
driving
in
a
car
,
you
're
braking
,
right
?
that
means
the
second
derivative
's
negative
.
you
're
slowing
down
.
and
then
suddenly
you
step
on
the
gas
.
now
you
're
accelerating
.
your
second
derivative
's
positive
.
what
happened
,
right
?
something
big
happened
.
you
're
changing
regimes
from
concave
down
to
concave
up
and
you
want
to
denote
that
change
somehow
.
we
're
going
to
call
that
change
an
inflection
point
.
