upon a time, a long, long time ago in 
a cave somewhere, 
there cave person first 
started studying numbers 
cave person an idea 
idea is functions 
instead studying numbers, this 
cave person is going to 
study numbers depending numbers, 
relationships between numbers 
theres another way to think 
functions 
a different metaphor is that functions 
sound eat numbers, 
theyre done processing them, spit 
sound number 
functions eat numbers spit 
numbers 
food chain keeps going 
derivative is an operator 
that means is that like a 
function functions 
derivative eats a function 
done 
spits a new function, 
derivative 
first we studied numbers 
we studied functions, 
numbers that depend 
numbers things that you to 
numbers 
derivative 
derivative eats something 
eats something spits numbers 
derivative spits a new 
thing that eats numbers spits 
numbers 
derivative takes a function gives 
you 
a new function, this ddx notation is 
so 
powerful, that you start to talk 

derivative even youve applies 
to function 
look this, this is sort 
equation, really a nonsense 
equation 
second derivative minus one 
even mean 
equals derivative minus one, i 
here 
knows 
derivative plus one 
this sort nonsense looks similar to 
something reasonable, that 
x squared minus is x minus times x 
plus 
theres actually sense to this 
so lets try to make sense right 
hand side 
i apply to a function 
so we dont even really know this 
means, 
notations so powerful that 
going to lead us forward 
so im going to copy ddx minus in 
parentheses, i 
to figure im going to apply 
this thing to f 
im going to act like this distributes, so 
ill write ddx f 
plus times f 
i keep going, right 
this, if you kind imagine, might 
distribute this 
would that, would that mean 
im going to ddx this whole thing, so 
ddx 
ddx f plus f, minus times this 
so minus ddx f, plus f 
i keep calculating, 
derivative derivative f plus f 
well, derivative a sum is sum 
derivative so that makes sense 
thats derivative derivative 
f plus derivative f minus 
derivative f minus f, subtracting 
summing f, so subtracting f 
good news, ive got a plus derivative 
here, 
a minus derivative f there, so im 
left 
is d dx, d dx f, i 
could write second derivative f 
minus f 
well i could also write this second 
derivative minus , applied to f 
thats exactly whats 
side this equation 
this point, this is a sort 
cheating, so if this doesnt speak to you, 
dont worry 
upshot though, is that differentiation 
is 
an operation that you apply to functions 
possible to reason precisely 

differentiation in abstract an 
operation
