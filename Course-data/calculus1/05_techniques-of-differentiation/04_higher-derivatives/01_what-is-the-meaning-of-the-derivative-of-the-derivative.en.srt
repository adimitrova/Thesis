00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,962
[MUSIC] Thus far, I've been trying to 
sell you on the idea that the derivative 

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:11,162
of f measures how we wiggling the input 
effects the output. 

3
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:17,487
A very important point is that 
sensitivity to the input depends on where 

4
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,612
you're wiggling the input. 
And here's an example. 

5
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:28,216
Think about the function f(x)=x^3. 
f(2) which is 2^3 is 8. 

6
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:36,367
f(2.01) 2.01 cubed is 8.120601. 
So, the input change of 0.01 was 

7
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:41,632
magnified by about 12 times in the 
output. 

8
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:47,962
Now, think about f(3) which is 3^3, which 
is 27. 

9
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:53,865
f(3.01) is 27.270901 so the input change 
of 0.01 was magnified by about 24 times 

10
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:57,460
as much, 
right? This input change and this input 

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,789
change were magnified by different 
amounts. 

12
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:06,642
You know, you shouldn't be too surprised 
by that right, the derivative, of course, 

13
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:11,214
measures this. 
The derivative of this function is 3x^2, 

14
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:19,483
so the derivative at two is 3*2^2 is 3*4 
is 12 and not coincidentally, there's a 

15
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:27,205
12 here and there's a 12 here, right, 
that's reflecting the sensitivity of the 

16
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:32,626
output to the input change. And the 
derivative of this function at 3 is 

17
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:38,284
3*3^2, which is 3*9 which is 27 and 
again, not too surprisingly here's a 27, 

18
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:44,252
right? The point is just that how much 
the output is effected depends on where 

19
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:49,158
you're wiggling the input. 
If you're wiggling around 2, the output 

20
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:53,679
is affected by about 12 times as much if 
we're wiggling around 3, the output is 

21
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,588
affected by 27 times as much, 
right? The derivative isn't constant 

22
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:00,654
everywhere, it depends on where you're 
plugging in. 

23
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:05,164
We can package together all of those 
ratios of output changes to input changes 

24
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:10,253
as a single function. 
What I mean by this, well, f'(x) is the 

25
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:17,527
limit as h goes to 0 of f(x+h)-f(x)/h. 
And this limit doesn't just calculate the 

26
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:23,656
derivative at a particular point. 
This is actually a rule, right, this is a 

27
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:29,049
rule for a function. 
The function is f'(x) and this tells me 

28
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,885
how to compute that function at some 
input X. 

29
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:38,137
The derivative is a function. 
Now, since the derivative is itself a 

30
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:42,368
function, I can take the derivative of 
the derivative. 

31
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:47,681
I'm often going to write the second 
derivative, the derivative of the 

32
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,335
derivative this way, 
f''(x). 

33
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:54,370
There's some other notations that you'll 
see in the wild as well. 

34
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,070
So, here's the derivative of f. 
If I take the derivative of the 

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,348
derivative, this would be the second 
derivative but I might write this a 

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,090
little bit differently. 
I could put these 2 d's together, so to 

37
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,832
speak, and these dx's together and then 
I'll be left with this. 

38
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:16,753
The second derivative of f(x). 
A subtle point here is if f were maybe y, 

39
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:24,159
you might see this written down and 
sometimes people write this dy^2, that's 

40
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,217
not right. 
I mean, it's d^2 dx^2 is the second 

41
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:32,534
derivative of y. 
The derivative measures the slope of the 

42
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:36,604
tangent line, geometrically. 
So, what does the second dreivative 

43
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:40,887
measure? Well, let's think back to what 
the derivative is measuring. 

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,446
The derivative is measuring how changes 
to the input affect the output. 

45
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:50,325
The deravitive of the derivative measures 
how changing the input changes, how 

46
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:55,652
changing the input changes the output, 
and I'm not just repeating myself here, 

47
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,297
it's really what the second derivative is 
measuring. 

48
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:04,106
It's measuring how the input affects how 
the input affects the output. 

49
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:07,825
If you say it like that, it doesn't make 
a whole lot of sense. 

50
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:12,761
Maybe a geometric example will help 
convey what the second derivative is 

51
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,742
measuring. 
Here's a function, y=1+x^2. 

52
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:16,117
And I've drawn this graph and I've 
slected three points on the graph. 

53
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:19,027
Let's at a tangent line through those 3 
points. 

54
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:23,697
So, here's the tangent line through this 
bottom point, the point 0,1 and the 

55
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,812
tangent line to the graph at that point 
is horizontal, right, the derivative is 0 

56
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,842
there. 
If I move over here, the tangent line has 

57
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:36,582
positive slope and if I move over to this 
third point and draw the tangent line 

58
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:41,592
now, the derivative there is even larger. 
The line has more slope than the line 

59
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:45,049
through that point. 
What's going on here is that the 

60
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:49,296
derivative is different. 
Here it's 0, here it's positive, here 

61
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:54,876
it's larger still, right? The derivative 
is changing and the second derivative is 

62
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:58,352
measuring how quickly the derivative is 
changing. 

63
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:03,058
Contrast that with say, this example of 
just a perfectly straight line. 

64
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:08,102
Here, I've drawn 3 points on this line. 
If I draw the tangent line to this line, 

65
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:11,789
it's just itself. 
I mean, the tangent line to this line is 

66
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,616
just the line I started with, right? So, 
the slope of this tangent line isn't 

67
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,740
changing at all. 
And the second derivative of this 

68
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,932
function, y=x+1, really is 0, right? 
The function's derivative isn't changing 

69
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:31,919
at all. 
Here, in this example, the function's 

70
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,327
derivative really is changing and I can 
see that if I take the second derivative 

71
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:42,062
of this, 
if I differentiate this, I get 2x, and if 

72
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:46,335
I differentiate that again, I just get 
two, which isn't 0. 

73
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:51,289
There's also a physical interpretation of 
the second derivative. 

74
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,840
So, let's call p(t), the function that 
records your position at time t. 

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,054
Now, what happens if I differentiate 
this? What's the derivative with respect 

76
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:05,443
to time of p(t)? 
I might write that, p'(t). 

77
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:10,834
That's asking, how quickly is your 
position changing, well, that's velocity. 

78
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:14,940
That's how quickly you're moving. 
You got a word for that. 

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,412
Now, I could ask the same question again. 
What happens if I differentiate velocity, 

80
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:25,358
I am asking how quickly is your velocity 
changing. 

81
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:29,417
We've got a word for that, too. 
That's acceleration. 

82
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:33,292
That's the rate of change of your rate of 
change. 

83
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,677
There's also an economic interpretation 
of the second derivative. 

84
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,882
So, maybe right now dhappiness, ddonuts 
for me is equal to 0, 

85
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:43,527
right? What this is saying? This is 
saying how much will my happiness be 

86
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,867
affected, if I change my donut eating 
habits. 

87
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:49,737
If I were really an economist I'd be 
talking about marginal utility of donuts 

88
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:53,492
or something, but, this is really a 
reasonable statement, right? This is 

89
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:57,273
saying that right at this moment you 
know, eating more donuts really won't 

90
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:01,667
make me any more happier and I probably 
am in this state right now, because if 

91
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,160
this weren't the case, I'd be eating 
donuts. 

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,484
So, let's suppose this is true right now 
and now, something else might be true 

93
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:10,128
right now. 
I might know something about the second 

94
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:13,112
derivative of my happiness with respect 
to donuts. 

95
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:16,537
What is this saying? Maybe this is 
positive right now. 

96
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:21,722
This is saying that a small change to my 
donut eating habits might affect how, 

97
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:25,432
changing my donut habits would affect how 
happy I am. 

98
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:31,250
If this were positive right now, should I 
be eating more donuts, even though 

99
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,229
dhappiness, ddonuts is equal to zero? 
Well, yeah, if this is positive, then a 

100
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:43,108
small change in my donut eating habits, 
just one more bite of delicious donut 

101
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:47,210
would suddenly result in dhappiness, 
ddonuts being positive, 

102
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,176
which should be great, then I should just 
keep on eating more donuts. 

103
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:55,596
Contrast this with the situation of the 
opposite situation, where the second 

104
00:07:55,596 --> 00:08:00,457
derivative happens with respect to donuts 
isn't positive, but the second derivative 

105
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:03,265
of happiness with respect to donuts is 
negative. 

106
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:08,292
If this is the case I absolutely should 
not be eating any more donuts because if 

107
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:12,962
I start eating more donuts, then I'm 
going to find that, that eating any more 

108
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:16,692
donuts will make me less happy. 
Let's think about this case 

109
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:19,787
geometrically. 
So here, I've drawn a graph of my 

110
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,065
happiness depending on how many donuts 
I'm eating. 

111
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:27,487
And here's two places that I might be 
standing right now on the graph. 

112
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:31,402
These are two places where the derivative 
is equal to zero. 

113
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:34,693
And I sort of know that I must be 
standing at a place where the derivative 

114
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:38,279
is 0, because if I were standing in the 
middle, I'd be eating more donuts right 

115
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,416
now. 
So, I know that I'm standing either right 

116
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,751
here, say, or right here. 
Or maybe here, or here. 

117
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,279
I'm standing some place where the 
derivative vanishes. 

118
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,569
Now, the question is how can I 
distinguish between these two different 

119
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:53,337
situations? Right here, if I started 
eating some more donuts, I'd really be 

120
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,541
much happier. 
But here, if I started eating some more 

121
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,389
donuts I'd be sadder. 
Well, look at this situation, this is a 

122
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,020
situation where the second derivative of 
happiness to respected donuts is 

123
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,364
positive, 
right? 

124
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:10,186
When I'm standing at the bottom of this 
hole, a small change in my donut 

125
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:14,666
consumption starts to increase the extent 
to which a change in my donut consumption 

126
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,705
will make me happier, 
alright? If I find that the second 

127
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:22,092
derivative of my happiness with respect 
to donuts is positive, I should be eating 

128
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,392
more donuts to walk up this hill to a 
place where I'm happier. 

129
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:28,061
Contrast that with a situation where I'm 
up here. 

130
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:32,743
Again, the derivative is zero so a small 
change in my doughnut consumption doesn't 

131
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:36,780
really seem to affect my happiness. 
But the second derivative in that 

132
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,305
situation is negative. 
And what does that mean? That means a 

133
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:44,854
small change to my donuts consumption 
starts to decrease the extent to which 

134
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:48,506
donuts make me happier. 
So, if I'm standing up here and I find 

135
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:52,283
that the second derivative of my 
happiness with respect to donuts is 

136
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:55,644
negative, I absolutely shouldn't be 
eating anymore donuts. 

137
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:59,826
I should just realize that I'm standing 
in a place where, at least for small 

138
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:04,155
changes to my donut consumption, I'm as 
happy as I can possibly be and I should 

139
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:07,868
just be content to stay there. 
There's more to this graph. 

140
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,569
Look at this graph again. 
So, maybe I am standing here. 

141
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,972
Maybe the derivative of my happiness with 
respect to donuts is zero. 

142
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:17,404
Maybe the second derivative of my 
happiness with respect to donuts is 

143
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:19,623
negative. 
So, I realize that I'm as happy as I 

144
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:22,544
really could be for small changes in my 
donut consumption. 

145
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,245
But if I'm willing to make a drastic 
change to my life, 

146
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:29,097
if I'm willing to just gorge myself on 
donuts, things are going to get real bad, 

147
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:32,313
but then they're going to get really 
really good and I'm going to start 

148
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:36,987
climbing up this great hill. 
It's not just about donuts, it's also 

149
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:41,257
true for Calculus. 
Look, right now, you might think things 

150
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:46,757
are really good, they're going to get 
worse. But with just a little bit more 

151
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:52,267
work, you're eventually going to climb up 
this hill and you're going to find the 

152
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:57,787
immeasurable rewards that increased 
Calculus knowledge will bring you. 

153
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,420
