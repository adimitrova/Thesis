music thus far, ive trying to 
sell you idea that derivative 
f measures we wiggling input 
effects output 
a important point is that 
sensitivity to input depends 
youre wiggling input 
heres an example 
think function fxx 
f is is 
f cubed is 
so, input change 
magnified times in 
output 
now, think f is , 
is 
f is so input change 
magnified times 
much, 
right this input change this input 
change magnified different 
amounts 
you know, you shouldnt surprised 
that right, derivative, course, 
measures this 
derivative this function is x, 
so derivative two is is 
is coincidentally, theres a 
here theres a here, right, 
thats reflecting sensitivity 
output to input change 
derivative this function is 
, is is 
again, surprisingly heres a , 
right point is that much 
output is effected depends 
youre wiggling input 
if youre wiggling around , output 
is affected times much if 
wiggling around , output is 
affected times much, 
right derivative isnt constant 
everywhere, depends youre 
plugging in 
we package together 
ratios output changes to input changes 
a single function 
i mean this, well, fx is 
limit h goes to fxhfxh 
this limit doesnt calculate 
derivative a particular point 
this is actually a rule, right, this is a 
rule a function 
function is fx this tells 
to compute that function 
input x 
derivative is a function 
now, since derivative is a 
function, i take derivative 
derivative 
im often going to write second 
derivative, derivative 
derivative this way, 
fx 
theres notations that youll 
see in wild well 
so, heres derivative f 
if i take derivative 
derivative, this would second 
derivative i might write this a 
little bit differently 
i could put ds together, so to 
speak, dxs together 
ill left this 
second derivative fx 
a subtle point here is if f maybe y, 
you might see this written 
sometimes people write this dy, thats 
right 
i mean, d dx is second 
derivative y 
derivative measures slope 
tangent line, geometrically 
so, second dreivative 
measure well, lets think back to 
derivative is measuring 
derivative is measuring changes 
to input affect output 
deravitive derivative measures 
changing input changes, 
changing input changes output, 
im repeating here, 
really second derivative is 
measuring 
measuring input affects 
input affects output 
if you say like that, doesnt make 
a whole lot sense 
maybe a geometric example will help 
convey second derivative is 
measuring 
heres a function, yx 
ive drawn this graph ive 
slected three points graph 
lets a tangent line 
points 
so, heres tangent line this 
bottom point, point , 
tangent line to graph that point 
is horizontal, right, derivative is 
there 
if i move here, tangent line 
positive slope if i move to this 
third point draw tangent line 
now, derivative there is even larger 
line slope line 
that point 
whats going here is that 
derivative is different 
here , here positive, here 
larger still, right derivative 
is changing second derivative is 
measuring quickly derivative is 
changing 
contrast that say, this example 
a perfectly straight line 
here, ive drawn points this line 
if i draw tangent line to this line, 

i mean, tangent line to this line is 
line i started with, right so, 
slope this tangent line isnt 
changing 
second derivative this 
function, yx, really is , right 
functions derivative isnt changing 

here, in this example, functions 
derivative really is changing i 
see that if i take second derivative 
this, 
if i differentiate this, i get x, if 
i differentiate that again, i get 
two, isnt 
theres also a physical interpretation 
second derivative 
so, lets call pt, function that 
records position time 
now, happens if i differentiate 
this whats derivative respect 
to time pt 
i might write that, pt 
thats asking, quickly is 
position changing, well, thats velocity 
thats quickly youre moving 
you got a word that 
now, i could ask question 
happens if i differentiate velocity, 
i asking quickly is velocity 
changing 
weve got a word that, 
thats acceleration 
thats rate change rate 
change 
theres also an economic interpretation 
second derivative 
so, maybe right dhappiness, ddonuts 
is equal to , 
right this is saying this is 
saying much will happiness 
affected, if i change donut eating 
habits 
if i really an economist id 
talking marginal utility donuts 
something, but, this is really a 
reasonable statement, right this is 
saying that right this moment you 
know, eating donuts really wont 
make happier i probably 
in this state right now, if 
this werent case, id eating 
donuts 
so, lets suppose this is true right 
now, something else might true 
right 
i might know something second 
derivative happiness respect 
to donuts 
is this saying maybe this is 
positive right 
this is saying that a small change to 
donut eating habits might affect how, 
changing donut habits would affect 
happy i 
if this positive right now, i 
eating donuts, even though 
dhappiness, ddonuts is equal to zero 
well, yeah, if this is positive, a 
small change in donut eating habits, 
one bite delicious donut 
would suddenly result in dhappiness, 
ddonuts positive, 
great, i 
keep eating donuts 
contrast this situation 
opposite situation, second 
derivative happens respect to donuts 
isnt positive, second derivative 
happiness respect to donuts is 
negative 
if this is case i absolutely 
eating donuts if 
i start eating donuts, im 
going to find that, that eating 
donuts will make less happy 
lets think this case 
geometrically 
so here, ive drawn a graph 
happiness depending many donuts 
im eating 
heres two places that i might 
standing right graph 
two places derivative 
is equal to zero 
i sort know that i must 
standing a place derivative 
is , if i standing in 
middle, id eating donuts right 

so, i know that im standing either right 
here, say, right here 
maybe here, here 
im standing place 
derivative vanishes 
now, question is i 
distinguish between two different 
situations right here, if i started 
eating donuts, id really 
much happier 
here, if i started eating 
donuts id sadder 
well, look this situation, this is a 
situation second derivative 
happiness to respected donuts is 
positive, 
right 
im standing bottom this 
hole, a small change in donut 
consumption starts to increase extent 
to a change in donut consumption 
will make happier, 
alright if i find that second 
derivative happiness respect 
to donuts is positive, i eating 
donuts to walk this hill to a 
place im happier 
contrast that a situation im 
here 
again, derivative is zero so a small 
change in doughnut consumption doesnt 
really seem to affect happiness 
second derivative in that 
situation is negative 
that mean that means a 
small change to donuts consumption 
starts to decrease extent to 
donuts make happier 
so, if im standing here i find 
that second derivative 
happiness respect to donuts is 
negative, i absolutely shouldnt 
eating anymore donuts 
i realize that im standing 
in a place where, least small 
changes to donut consumption, im 
happy i possibly i 
content to stay there 
theres to this graph 
look this graph 
so, maybe i standing here 
maybe derivative happiness 
respect to donuts is zero 
maybe second derivative 
happiness respect to donuts is 
negative 
so, i realize that im happy i 
really could small changes in 
donut consumption 
if im willing to make a drastic 
change to life, 
if im willing to gorge 
donuts, things going to get real bad, 
theyre going to get really 
really good im going to start 
climbing this great hill 
donuts, also 
true calculus 
look, right now, you might think things 
really good, theyre going to get 
worse a little bit 
work, youre eventually going to climb 
this hill youre going to find 
immeasurable rewards that increased 
calculus knowledge will bring you
