[MUSIC].

2
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:07,541
Once upon a time, a long, long time ago in
a cave somewhere,

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:12,850
there was some cave person who first
started studying numbers.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,070
And then the cave person had an idea.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,230
The idea is functions.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,749
Instead of just studying numbers, this
cave person is going to

7
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:28,870
study numbers depending on other numbers,
the relationships between numbers.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,580
There's another way to think about
functions.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,322
A different metaphor is that functions
[SOUND] eat numbers, and after

10
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:43,429
they're done processing them, they spit
out [SOUND] some other number.

11
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:46,638
Functions eat numbers and spit out
numbers.

12
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:49,510
But the food chain keeps going.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,530
The derivative is an operator.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,140
And what that means is that it's like a
function for functions.

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,330
The derivative eats a function and after
it's done

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,850
with it it spits out a new function, the
derivative.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,150
First we studied numbers.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,820
Then we studied functions, which are
numbers that depend

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,030
on numbers or things that you do to
numbers.

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,370
And now the derivative.

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,590
The derivative eats something which itself
eats something and spits out numbers.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,620
And then the derivative spits out a new

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,940
thing that eats numbers and spits out
numbers.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,524
The derivative takes a function and gives
you

25
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:27,972
a new function, and this ddx notation is
so

26
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,624
powerful, that you can start to talk about
the

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,650
derivative even before you've applies it
to any function.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,800
Look at this, this is some sort

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,440
of equation, but it's really a nonsense
equation.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,190
The second derivative minus one.

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,820
What does it even mean?

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,200
Equals the derivative minus one, what am I
doing here?

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,080
Who knows?

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,120
The derivative plus one?

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,061
This sort of nonsense looks similar to
something very reasonable, that

36
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,290
x squared minus 1 is x minus 1 times x
plus 1.

37
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,120
There's actually some sense to this.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,730
So let's try to make sense of the right
hand side.

39
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,760
After I apply it to a function.

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,140
So we don't even really know what this
means, but

41
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,980
the notation's so powerful that it's just
going to lead us forward.

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,196
So I'm going to copy down ddx minus 1 in
parentheses, and I

43
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,750
have to figure out how I'm going to apply
this thing to F.

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm going to act like this distributes, so
I'll write DDX of F.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,300
Plus 1 times f.

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,770
Now I can keep on going, right?

47
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,710
This, if you kind of imagine, might
distribute over this.

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,440
What would that, what would that mean?

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,870
I'm going to d/dx this whole thing, so
d/dx of

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,260
d/dx of f plus f, minus 1 times this.

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,000
So minus d/dx of f, plus f.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,180
And now I can keep calculating, the
derivative of the derivative of f plus f.

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,510
Well, the derivative of a sum is the sum
of the derivative so that makes sense.

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,034
That's the derivative of the derivative of
f plus the derivative of f minus the

55
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:14,310
derivative of f minus f, subtracting
summing F, so it's subtracting F.

56
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,290
Now good news, I've got a plus derivative
here, and

57
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,650
a minus derivative of F there, so what I'm
left

58
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,750
with is D Dx, D Dx of F, which I

59
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,417
could write as the second derivative of F
minus F.

60
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:36,660
Well I could also write this as the second
derivative minus 1, applied to F.

61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,380
And that's exactly what's on the other
side of this equation.

62
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,980
At this point, this is all a sort of

63
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,350
cheating, so if this doesn't speak to you,
don't worry.

64
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,390
The upshot though, is that differentiation
is

65
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,141
an operation that you apply to functions.

66
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,105
And it's possible to reason precisely
about

67
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:58,782
differentiation in the abstract just as an
operation.

68
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:05,879
