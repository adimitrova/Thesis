[MUSIC].

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:08,150
Earlier we saw how the sign, the S-I-G-N,
of

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,304
the derivative encoded whether the
function was increasing or decreasing.

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,280
Thinking back to the graph, here I've just
drawn some random graph.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,450
What is the derivative encoding?

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,411
Well here this point a, the slope of this
tangent line is

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:27,015
negative, the derivative is negative, and
yeah, the function's going down here.

8
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,835
At this point b, the slope of this tangent

9
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:31,650
line is positive and the function's
increasing through here.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,260
All right?

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,750
The derivative is negative here, and it's
positive here.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,090
The function's decreasing here, and
increasing here.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,500
So that's what the derivative is
measuring.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,450
What is the sign of the second derivative
really encoding?

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,490
Maybe we don't have such a good word for
it so we'll just make up a new word.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,186
The S-I-G-N, the sign of the second
derivative, the

17
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:56,880
sign of the derivative of the derivative
measures concavity.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,355
The word's concavity, and here's the two
possibilities, concave up where the second

19
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:08,170
derivative is positive, and concave down
where the second derivative is negative.

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,580
And I've drawn sort of cartoony pictures
of

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,500
what the graphs look like in these two
cases.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,953
Now, note it's not just increasing or
decreasing, but this concavity

23
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,472
is recording sort of the shape of the
graph in some sense.

24
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:24,241
Positive second derivative makes it look
like

25
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,294
this, negative second derivative makes the
graph

26
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,637
look like this, and I'm just labeling

27
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:32,520
these two things concave up and concave
down.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,540
And this makes sense if we think of the

29
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,610
second derivative as measuring the change
in the derivative.

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,300
So let's think back to this graph again.

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,180
Here's this graph of some random function.

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,500
Look at this part of the graph right here.

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,290
That looks like the concave up shape

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,740
from before, where the second derivative
was positive.

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,730
So we might think that the second
derivative is positive here.

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,830
That would mean that the derivative is
increasing.

37
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,074
What that really means is that the slope

38
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:04,920
of a tangent line through this region is
increasing.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
And that's exactly what's happening.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,874
The slope is negative here, and as I move
this

41
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:15,310
tangent line over, the slope of that
tangent line is increasing.

42
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,615
The second derivative is positive here.

43
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:26,010
You can tell yourself the same story for
concave down.

44
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,140
So look over here in our sample graph.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,620
That part of the graph looks like this

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,530
concave down picture where the second
derivative's negative.

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,880
Now, if the second derivative is negative,
that means the derivative is decreasing.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,520
And yeah, the slope of the tangent line
through this region is going down, right?

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,755
The slope starts off pretty positive over
here, and as I move this

50
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:54,989
tangent line over, the slope is zero, and
now getting more and more negative.

51
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,760
So in this part of the graph, the second
derivative is negative.

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,030
What happens in between?

53
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,410
Where does the regime change take place?

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,370
So over here, the second derivative is
negative.

55
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,860
Over here, the second derivative is
positive.

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,090
There's a point in between, maybe it's
right here.

57
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,970
And at that point the second derivative is
equal to zero.

58
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,570
And on one side it's concave down, and on
the other side it's concave up.

59
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,140
A point where the concavity actually
changes is called an inflection point.

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,755
Alright, the, it's concave down over here,
and it's concave up over here and the

61
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:38,355
place where the change is taking place,
we're

62
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:42,110
going to, just going to call those points
inflection points.

63
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,806
It's not that the terminology itself is so
important, but we want

64
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:48,314
words to describe the qualitative
phenomena

65
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:50,940
that we're seeing in these graphs.

66
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,530
Inflection points are something you can
really feel.

67
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,820
I mean, if you're driving in a car, you're
braking, right?

68
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,570
That means the second derivative's
negative.

69
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,530
You're slowing down.

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,120
And then suddenly you step on the gas.

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,414
Now you're accelerating.

72
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,248
Your second derivative's positive.

73
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,380
What happened, right?

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,864
Something big happened.

75
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:11,314
You're changing regimes from concave down
to concave

76
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:14,320
up and you want to denote that change
somehow.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,951
We're going to call that change an
inflection point.

78
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:26,499
