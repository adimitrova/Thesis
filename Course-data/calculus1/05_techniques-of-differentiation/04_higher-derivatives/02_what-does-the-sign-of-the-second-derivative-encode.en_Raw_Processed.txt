earlier we saw sign, sign, 

derivative encoded whether 
function increasing decreasing 
thinking back to graph, here ive 
drawn random graph 
is derivative encoding 
well here this point a, slope this 
tangent line is 
negative, derivative is negative, 
yeah, functions going here 
this point b, slope this tangent 
line is positive functions 
increasing here 
right 
derivative is negative here, 
positive here 
functions decreasing here, 
increasing here 
so thats derivative is 
measuring 
is sign second derivative 
really encoding 
maybe we dont a good word 
so well make a new word 
sign, sign second 
derivative, 
sign derivative derivative 
measures concavity 
words concavity, heres two 
possibilities, concave second 
derivative is positive, concave 
second derivative is negative 
ive drawn sort cartoony pictures 

graphs look like in two 
cases 
now, note increasing 
decreasing, this concavity 
is recording sort shape 
graph in sense 
positive second derivative makes look 
like 
this, negative second derivative makes 
graph 
look like this, im labeling 
two things concave concave 

this makes sense if we think 
second derivative measuring change 
in derivative 
so lets think back to this graph 
heres this graph random function 
look this part graph right here 
that looks like concave shape 
before, second derivative 
positive 
so we might think that second 
derivative is positive here 
that would mean that derivative is 
increasing 
that really means is that slope 
a tangent line this region is 
increasing 
thats exactly whats happening 
slope is negative here, i move 
this 
tangent line over, slope that 
tangent line is increasing 
second derivative is positive here 
you tell story 
concave 
so look here in sample graph 
that part graph looks like this 
concave picture second 
derivatives negative 
now, if second derivative is negative, 
that means derivative is decreasing 
yeah, slope tangent line 
this region is going down, right 
slope starts pretty positive 
here, i move this 
tangent line over, slope is zero, 
getting negative 
so in this part graph, second 
derivative is negative 
happens in between 
regime change take place 
so here, second derivative is 
negative 
here, second derivative is 
positive 
theres a point in between, maybe 
right here 
that point second derivative is 
equal to zero 
one side concave down, 
side concave 
a point concavity actually 
changes is called an inflection point 
alright, the, concave here, 
concave here 
place change is taking place, 

going to, going to call points 
inflection points 
that terminology is so 
important, we want 
words to describe qualitative 
phenomena 
that seeing in graphs 
inflection points something you 
really feel 
i mean, if youre driving in a car, youre 
braking, right 
that means second derivatives 
negative 
youre slowing 
suddenly you step gas 
youre accelerating 
second derivatives positive 
happened, right 
something big happened 
youre changing regimes concave 
to concave 
you want to denote that change 
somehow 
going to call that change an 
inflection point
