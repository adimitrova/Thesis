2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,730
I'm gonna say a little bit about how
this course as a whole is structured.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,350
Right, we're really covering three topics.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,770
Covering limits,
derivatives, and integrals.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,390
And for each of those three topics,
we're looking at three different things.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,960
We're looking at the definition,
the sort of concepts behind it.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,260
Looking at techniques,
sort of how we work with those concepts.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,360
And then we're looking at applications,
what can we do with it.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,860
So, take a look at limits, all right.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,971
We learned about the definitions for
the concepts behind limits at first, and

11
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:39,970
then we learned some techniques for
doing computations involving limits.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,820
Say, using a little bit of algebra or
thinking about infinity.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,150
And now we want to think
about an application.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,590
Why do we care about limits?

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,140
Well the reason that we care about
limits was because of the derivative.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,970
Right?
We use the limits to define the derivative

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,079
and to introduce some of
the concepts of the derivative.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,510
And now that we've introduced
the concept of the derivative,

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,230
we wanna go into the techniques or
the computational questions.

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,160
How do you actually compute a derivative?

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,050
And in order to do those kinds of
computations, we have to think about

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,230
how would you calculate the derivative
of a product of two things,

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,260
if you knew the derivative
of those two things.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,654
Or how would you calculate
the derivative of a fraction if you knew

25
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:24,310
how to differentiate the numerator and
the denominator separately?

26
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,430
Those are the kinds of questions
that'll occupy us now.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:37,430
