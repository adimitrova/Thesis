[music] i'm gonna say a little bit about how this course as a whole is structured.
right, we're really covering three topics.
covering limits, derivatives, and integrals.
and for each of those three topics, we're looking at three different things.
we're looking at the definition, the sort of concepts behind it.
looking at techniques, sort of how we work with those concepts.
and then we're looking at applications, what can we do with it.
so, take a look at limits, all right.
we learned about the definitions for the concepts behind limits at first, and then we learned some techniques for doing computations involving limits.
say, using a little bit of algebra or thinking about infinity.
and now we want to think about an application.
why do we care about limits?
well the reason that we care about limits was because of the derivative.
right?
we use the limits to define the derivative and to introduce some of the concepts of the derivative.
and now that we've introduced the concept of the derivative, we wanna go into the techniques or the computational questions.
how do you actually compute a derivative?
and in order to do those kinds of computations, we have to think about how would you calculate the derivative of a product of two things, if you knew the derivative of those two things.
or how would you calculate the derivative of a fraction if you knew how to differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately?
those are the kinds of questions that'll occupy us now.
