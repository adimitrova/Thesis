music 
im gonna say a little bit 
this course a whole is structured 
right, really covering three topics 
covering limits, 
derivatives, integrals 
three topics, 
looking three different things 
looking definition, 
sort concepts behind 
looking techniques, 
sort we work concepts 
looking applications, 
we 
so, take a look limits, right 
we learned definitions 
concepts behind limits first, 
we learned techniques 
computations involving limits 
say, using a little bit algebra 
thinking infinity 
we want to think 
an application 
we care limits 
well reason that we care 
limits derivative 
right 
we use limits to define derivative 
to introduce 
concepts derivative 
that weve introduced 
concept derivative, 
we wanna go techniques 
computational questions 
you actually compute a derivative 
in order to kinds 
computations, we to think 
would you calculate derivative 
a product two things, 
if you knew derivative 
two things 
would you calculate 
derivative a fraction if you knew 
to differentiate numerator 
denominator separately 
kinds questions 
thatll occupy us
