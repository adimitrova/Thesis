00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,022
[music].
We've seen a little bit of this linear

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:11,865
approximation business already.
A long time ago, we saw this.

3
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:16,847
That, f of x plus h is approximately f of
x.

4
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:21,259
Well, that much at least is really just
because f is say continuous, right?

5
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:25,605
Nearby inputs should be sent to nearby
outputs, but let's suppose that f is

6
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,423
differential, then we can say more, all
right?

7
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:31,755
I'm going to add to this h times the
derivative of f at x.

8
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:36,269
What is the derivative measure, right?
It's the ratio of how much the output

9
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,996
changes to an input change
infinitesimally.

10
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:43,893
But for an actual input change of h, if I
take this, which is the ratio of output

11
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:48,359
change to input change and I multiply it
by how much the input change is.

12
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,676
This quantity should tell me how much I
expect the output to change when I go from

13
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:56,973
X to X plus H.
Where does this formula actually come

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,991
from?
Well, let's think back to the definition

15
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,508
of derivative.
Right?

16
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:07,040
What's the definition of derivative?
The derivative of F at X is the limit as h

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,982
approaches 0 of f of x plus h minus f of
x, all over h.

18
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:14,742
Alright, that's the definition of
derivative.

19
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:20,273
Now how does that help us here?
Well, if I just pick some value of h, an

20
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:26,673
actual value of h, that's not 0 but close
to 0, then I get that f prime of x should

21
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:32,773
be approximately f of x plus h for that
small but p-, you know, non, non zero

22
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:38,849
value of h, minus f of x over h.
So this is approximately equal, as long as

23
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,315
h is small.
Now I multiply both sides of this

24
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:48,015
approximate quantity by h and I'll find
that h times f prime of x should be

25
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:53,945
approximately F of X plus H minus F of X.
And then I'll add F of X to both sides,

26
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:59,990
and what I'll get is that H times F prime
of X plus F of X should be approximately F

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,935
of X plus H, and that's the statement that
we had before, right?

28
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:10,743
That the value of function X plus H is
approximately the value of the function of

29
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:14,493
X plus something I'm getting from the
derivative.

30
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:18,218
The derivative of f at x times how much I
wiggled the input by.

31
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:22,395
So I've got this formula, but why do I
care about this formula at all?

32
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:26,999
Well, I care because this is really what I
wanted in the first place, right?

33
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:31,493
I really wanted to understand how wiggling
the input would effect the output, and

34
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:36,113
fundamentally, you know, the derivative
isn't just some random limit that I cooked

35
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:39,857
up for you to evaluate.
It's supposed to say something meaningful

36
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:44,081
about the function, and this is what's
telling us what the derivative means,

37
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,525
right?
The derivative really means something

38
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,148
about how wiggling the input affects the
output.

39
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:52,084
There's another reason to care about this
formula.

40
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:57,106
We can use this formula, in fact we've
already used this formula to numerically

41
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:01,236
approximate a function that might be hard
to compute otherwise.

42
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:08,587
Um,, let's look at a function f of x will
be say, the cube root of x, and let's look

43
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:14,375
at the input 125 and f at 125, right?
What's the cube of 125?

44
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,756
That's 5, because 5 times 5 times 5,
that's 125.

45
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:23,334
So the cube of 125 is 5.
Now let's try to wiggle the input and see

46
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,672
what happens.
Let's wiggle by h, which will be three.

47
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:31,059
Three's not all that small, but compared
to 125, three's pretty small.

48
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:34,018
And I'd like to know what f of a plus h
is, right?

49
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,249
I want to know what the cube root of 125
plus 3, 128 is.

50
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:40,269
And you know that's going to be hard to
know, right?

51
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,726
So I'm only going to know Approximately.
But I can use the derivative here, right?

52
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:48,516
Because the derivative tells me how
wiggling the input affects the output.

53
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,751
So as you can get the derivative of this
function at the input A.

54
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:55,520
So let's differentiate this function.
And this is X to the one third, so the

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,796
derivative is one third times X to the
minus two thirds, right?

56
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:02,446
This minus 2 3rd as 1 3rd minus 1.
It's a power rule.

57
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:06,376
Let's compute the derivative at the input
125.

58
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:11,963
So that means I look at 1 3rd times 125 to
the negative 2 3rd power.

59
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:17,469
Well, 125 to the negative 3rd, the
negative 2 3rds power.

60
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:22,447
That's 1 25th, and 1 3rd times 1 25th,
that is 1 75th.

61
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:28,363
So this tells me what the derivative is at
a 125, now how does that help?

62
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:35,163
Remember the other formula for this linear
approximation game, that f of a plus h,

63
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:41,463
which is what I'm trying to compute,
should be approximately f of a plus h

64
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:46,991
times f prime of a, and I know what all of
these quantities are now.

65
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:52,795
F of a is 5, h is 3.
And F prime at A is 1 75 and 5 plus 3

66
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:59,945
times 1 75 that's 5.04.
Now, how close is that to the actual

67
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:09,424
retail value of the cube root of 128.
Well, it turns out that the cube root of

68
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:19,390
128 is actually about 5.0396841 and it
keeps on going, which is awfully close to

69
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,953
5.04.
So our layer approximation game is working

70
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:26,784
really quite well.
This idea that the complicated function

71
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,572
like the cube root function, with its
curved graph can be approximated very

72
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,481
well, at least for short intervals by
straight lines, right?

73
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:42,899
This idea of replacing curved object with
perfectly straight lines, that's a key

74
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,506
idea of calculus.
In short, curves are way too complicated

75
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:54,435
for us to understand.
Lines, on the other hand, just straight

76
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:58,795
lines, are much easier for us to think
about.
