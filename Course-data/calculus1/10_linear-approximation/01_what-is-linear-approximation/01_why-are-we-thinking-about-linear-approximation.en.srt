00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,770
Calculus is rich enough that there's a ton
of

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,500
different ways to think about the concepts
in calculus.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,820
Think about the derivative.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,090
One way to think about the derivative is
as the

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,060
ratio of output change to some small,
infinitesimal input change.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,964
But another way to think about the

8
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:25,740
derivative, is in terms of linear
approximation.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,900
And that's the idea that we want to
exploit right now.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,810
This is really the story of, of all of
calculus.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,730
You know, you want to understand curved
objects.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,470
I want to understand some graph of a
function that's very curved.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,120
And that's hard to do.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,816
But, if I zoom in close enough on the
functions graph right, if the

15
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:47,720
function's differentiable, then when I
zoom in,

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,260
that graph looks like a straight line.

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,750
That's the idea of linear approximation.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,100
We can study these complicated curved
graphs by zooming

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,359
in and imagining that, at least
approximately, they're straight lines.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,010
And there's a couple of huge benefits to
doing this.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,960
One thing that we can use this for, is to
approximate values of the function.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,810
And the other thing that we're going to be
able to use this for, is Newton's method.

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,270
We'll be able to do things like, at

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,610
least approximately, find roots of very
complicated looking polynomials.
