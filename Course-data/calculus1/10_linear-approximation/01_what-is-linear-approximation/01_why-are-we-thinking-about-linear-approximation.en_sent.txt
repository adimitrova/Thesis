[music] calculus is rich enough that there's a ton of different ways to think about the concepts in calculus.
think about the derivative.
one way to think about the derivative is as the ratio of output change to some small, infinitesimal input change.
but another way to think about the derivative, is in terms of linear approximation.
and that's the idea that we want to exploit right now.
this is really the story of, of all of calculus.
you know, you want to understand curved objects.
i want to understand some graph of a function that's very curved.
and that's hard to do.
but, if i zoom in close enough on the functions graph right, if the function's differentiable, then when i zoom in, that graph looks like a straight line.
that's the idea of linear approximation.
we can study these complicated curved graphs by zooming in and imagining that, at least approximately, they're straight lines.
and there's a couple of huge benefits to doing this.
one thing that we can use this for, is to approximate values of the function.
and the other thing that we're going to be able to use this for, is newton's method.
we'll be able to do things like, at least approximately, find roots of very complicated looking polynomials.
