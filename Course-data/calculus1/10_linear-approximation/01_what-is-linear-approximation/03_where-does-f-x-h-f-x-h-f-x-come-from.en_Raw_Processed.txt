music 
weve seen a little bit this linear 
approximation business already 
a long time ago, we saw this 
that, f x plus h is approximately f 
x 
well, that much least is really 
f is say continuous, right 
nearby inputs sent to nearby 
outputs, lets suppose that f is 
differential, we say more, 
right 
im going to add to this h times 
derivative f x 
is derivative measure, right 
ratio much output 
changes to an input change 
infinitesimally 
an actual input change h, if i 
take this, is ratio output 
change to input change i multiply 
much input change is 
this quantity tell much i 
expect output to change i go 
x to x plus h 
this formula actually come 

well, lets think back to definition 
derivative 
right 
whats definition derivative 
derivative f x is limit h 
approaches f x plus h minus f 
x, h 
alright, thats definition 
derivative 
that help us here 
well, if i pick value h, an 
actual value h, thats close 
to , i get that f prime x 
approximately f x plus h that 
small p, you know, non, non zero 
value h, minus f x h 
so this is approximately equal, long 
h is small 
i multiply sides this 
approximate quantity h ill find 
that h times f prime x 
approximately f x plus h minus f x 
ill add f x to sides, 
ill get is that h times f prime 
x plus f x approximately f 
x plus h, thats statement that 
we before, right 
that value function x plus h is 
approximately value function 
x plus something im getting 
derivative 
derivative f x times much i 
wiggled input 
so ive got this formula, i 
care this formula 
well, i care this is really i 
wanted in first place, right 
i really wanted to understand wiggling 
input would effect output, 
fundamentally, you know, derivative 
isnt random limit that i cooked 
you to evaluate 
supposed to say something meaningful 
function, this is whats 
telling us derivative means, 
right 
derivative really means something 
wiggling input affects 
output 
theres another reason to care this 
formula 
we use this formula, in fact weve 
already used this formula to numerically 
approximate a function that might hard 
to compute otherwise 
um,, lets look a function f x will 
say, cube root x, lets look 
input f , right 
whats cube 
thats , times times , 
thats 
so cube is 
lets try to wiggle input see 
happens 
lets wiggle h, will three 
threes that small, compared 
to , threes pretty small 
id like to know f a plus h 
is, right 
i want to know cube root 
plus , is 
you know thats going to hard to 
know, right 
so im going to know approximately 
i use derivative here, right 
derivative tells 
wiggling input affects output 
so you get derivative this 
function input a 
so lets differentiate this function 
this is x to one third, so 
derivative is one third times x to 
minus two thirds, right 
this minus rd rd minus 
a power rule 
lets compute derivative input 
so that means i look rd times to 
negative rd power 
well, to negative rd, 
negative rds power 
thats th, rd times th, 
that is th 
so this tells derivative is 
a , that help 
remember formula this linear 
approximation game, that f a plus h, 
is im trying to compute, 
approximately f a plus h 
times f prime a, i know 
quantities 
f a is , h is 
f prime a is plus 
times thats 
now, close is that to actual 
retail value cube root 
well, turns that cube root 
is actually 
keeps going, is awfully close to 
so layer approximation game is working 
really quite well 
this idea that complicated function 
like cube root function, 
curved graph approximated 
well, least short intervals 
straight lines, right 
this idea replacing curved object 
perfectly straight lines, thats a key 
idea calculus 
in short, curves way complicated 
us to understand 
lines, hand, straight 
lines, much easier us to think
