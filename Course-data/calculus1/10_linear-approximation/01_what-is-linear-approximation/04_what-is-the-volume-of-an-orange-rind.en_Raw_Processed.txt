music here, ive got an orange 
id like to measure say, radius 
orange, thinking this orange a 
perfect sphere 
one way to this would to measure, 
say, circumference orange 
around equator 
so here if i measure that looks like 
centimeters 
so circumference orange is 
centimeters 
that tell about, say 
radius orange 
well that circumference will pi times 
radius orange 
so if i divide sides pi 
i get that radius orange is 
pi centimeters 
much rind is there this orange 
that could formulated a linear 
approximation problem 
well lets fit this upg so, i 
calculated orange radius to 
pi centimeters 
i want to figure thick rind 
is 
let 
let peel a bit orange here 
want to measure thick this is 
with, say little ruler here yeah, 
maybe three millimeters 
so, point three centimeters will 
rind thickness 
knowing rind thickness 
going to help to calculate, least 
approximate, volume rind in 
this whole orange 
well i know volume a sphere, 
modeling orange to be, is rds pi 
r q 
rind volume, is least 
approximately much volume changes 
i take this formula, replace r 
r minus h 
right 
i take that sphere i make 
a little bit smaller 
that change in volume is volume 
rind 
to understand wiggling input 
effects output, im going to use 
derivative 
formula that i want to 
differentiating here is this volume a 
sphere radius r 
is thirds pi r cubed noiseand if 
i differentiate this respect to r 
r cubed differentiates to r squared 
in denominator here will 
cancel this power rule 
so derivative will pi r squared 
im trying to approximate is 
rind volume is really difference 
between a sphere radius r a 
slightly smaller sphere ive shrunk 
past rind, right 
that difference will volume 
rind 
approximately this h times 
derivitive v r 
right, this is asking 
output change input goes r 
minus h to r 
approximately input change 
times derivative 
in this case i know 
oranges radius is pi, so ill 
use that r 
rinds thickness is point three 
centimeters so im going to use that 
h 
so this is point three centimeters times 
pi, times this radius, is pi 
centimeters squared 
so this is cubic centimeters 
well thats good im trying to 
calculate a volume 
ill keep calculating here 
so point times pi times 
pi squared 
cubic centimeters 
times is times , pi 
divided pi squared is going to a pi 
in denominator 
so ive got times pi cubic 
centimeters 
thats cubic centimeters 
so volume rind is approximately 
cubic centimeters 
admittedly i could calculated 
volume rind calculating 
volume whole thing 
calculating volume whole thing 
radius reduced h, taking a 
difference 
neat thing here is that you 
approximate that quantity using 
calculus, right 
thinking this linear 
approximation business 
i also want to see close 
linear approximation 
alright, so ive taken orange 
peeled rind, ive taken 
rind smooched this 
ball, ill try to calculate volume 
this rind ball 
i want to compute volume a rind, 
i made that rind ball here, let let 
compute circumference this rind 
ball 
thats centimeters 
so circumference ball rind is 
centimeters, that means rind 
ball a radius 
pi centimeters 
here, assuming rind ball is a 
perfect sphere 
this would volume rind ball 
in here i gotta put radius, 
is 
pie 
so, rds pie radius cubed, 
thats cubic centimeters 
so, yeah, i mean, i actually took 
rind orange value that we 
got is pretty close to linear 
approximation told us volume rind 

this perspective sheds light 
might otherwise seen 
random coincidence 
you notice is that volume 
a sphere is rds pi r cubed 
surface area a sphere is pi 
r squared 
two formulas related right 
if i differentiate this volume formula 
respect to r, i get surface area 
formula 
seeing that calculus isnt 
really solving specific problems 
i dont care volume rind 
this orange 
right 
if that calculus good for, 
would care 
right 
calculus is really good is 
providing a general framework 
that general framework we begin to see 
patterns between different concepts 
like this fact, surface area a 
sphere is derivative volume 
a sphere respect to radius 
thats really a coincidence, right 
calculus is providing an explanation 
that supposed coincidence
