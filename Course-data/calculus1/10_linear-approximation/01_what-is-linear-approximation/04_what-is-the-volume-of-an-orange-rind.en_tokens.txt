here
,
i
've
got
an
orange
.
i
'd
like
to
measure
say
,
the
radius
of
the
orange
,
thinking
of
this
orange
as
a
perfect
sphere
.
one
way
to
do
this
would
be
to
measure
,
say
,
the
circumference
of
the
orange
around
its
equator
.
so
here
if
i
measure
that
it
looks
like
it
's
about
24
centimeters
.
so
the
circumference
of
the
orange
is
24
centimeters
.
what
does
that
tell
me
about
,
say
the
radius
of
the
orange
?
well
that
circumference
will
be
2
pi
times
the
radius
of
the
orange
.
so
if
i
divide
both
sides
by
2
pi
.
i
get
that
the
radius
of
the
orange
is
about
12
over
pi
centimeters
.
how
much
rind
is
there
on
this
orange
?
that
could
be
formulated
as
a
linear
approximation
problem
.
well
let
's
fit
this
up./g
so
,
i
just
calculated
the
orange
radius
to
be
about
12
over
pi
centimeters
.
i
want
to
figure
out
how
thick
the
rind
is
.
let
me
.
let
me
peel
off
a
bit
of
the
orange
here
.
just
want
to
measure
how
thick
this
is
with
,
say
my
little
ruler
here
and
yeah
,
maybe
three
millimeters
.
so
,
point
three
centimeters
will
be
the
rind
thickness
.
now
how
does
knowing
the
rind
thickness
going
to
help
me
to
calculate
,
at
least
approximate
,
the
volume
of
the
rind
in
this
whole
orange
.
well
i
know
the
volume
of
a
sphere
,
which
by
modeling
the
orange
to
be
,
is
4
3rds
pi
r
q.
and
the
rind
volume
,
is
at
least
approximately
how
much
the
volume
changes
when
i
take
this
formula
,
and
replace
r
with
r
minus
h.
right
?
when
i
take
that
sphere
and
i
make
it
just
a
little
bit
smaller
.
that
change
in
volume
is
the
volume
of
the
rind
.
and
to
understand
how
wiggling
the
input
effects
the
output
,
i
'm
going
to
use
the
derivative
.
the
formula
that
i
want
to
be
differentiating
here
is
this
volume
of
a
sphere
of
radius
r.
which
is
4
thirds
pi
r
cubed
[
noise
]
and
if
i
differentiate
this
with
respect
to
r.
the
r
cubed
differentiates
to
3r
squared
.
and
the
3
in
the
denominator
here
will
cancel
this
3
by
the
power
rule
.
so
the
derivative
will
be
4
pi
r
squared
.
now
what
i
'm
trying
to
approximate
is
the
rind
volume
which
is
really
the
difference
between
a
sphere
of
radius
r
and
a
slightly
smaller
sphere
where
i
've
shrunk
down
just
past
the
rind
,
right
.
that
difference
will
be
the
volume
of
the
rind
.
and
approximately
this
h
times
the
derivitive
of
v
at
r.
right
,
because
this
is
asking
how
does
the
output
change
when
the
input
goes
from
r
minus
h
to
r.
and
it
's
approximately
the
input
change
times
the
derivative
.
now
in
this
case
what
do
i
know
?
the
orange
's
radius
is
12
over
pi
,
so
i
'll
use
that
for
r.
and
the
rind
's
thickness
is
point
three
centimeters
so
i
'm
going
to
use
that
for
h.
so
this
is
point
three
centimeters
times
4
pi
,
times
this
radius
,
which
is
12
over
pi
centimeters
squared
.
so
this
is
cubic
centimeters
.
well
that
's
good
because
i
'm
trying
to
calculate
a
volume
.
and
i
'll
just
keep
calculating
here
.
so
it
's
point
3
times
4
pi
times
144
over
pi
squared
.
cubic
centimeters
.
and
4
times
144
is
576
times
.3
,
the
pi
divided
the
pi
squared
is
going
to
be
a
pi
in
the
denominator
.
so
i
've
got
.3
times
576
over
pi
cubic
centimeters
.
that
's
about
55
cubic
centimeters
.
so
the
volume
of
the
rind
is
approximately
55
cubic
centimeters
.
now
admittedly
i
could
have
calculated
the
volume
of
the
rind
just
by
calculating
the
volume
of
the
whole
thing
.
calculating
the
volume
of
the
whole
thing
with
the
radius
reduced
by
h
,
and
taking
a
difference
.
but
the
neat
thing
here
is
that
you
can
approximate
that
quantity
by
using
calculus
,
right
?
by
thinking
about
this
linear
approximation
business
.
i
also
want
to
see
now
how
close
the
linear
approximation
was
.
alright
,
so
i
've
taken
my
orange
and
peeled
off
all
the
rind
,
and
i
've
taken
the
rind
and
smooched
it
down
into
this
ball
,
and
i
'll
try
to
calculate
the
volume
now
of
this
rind
ball
.
i
want
to
compute
the
volume
of
a
rind
,
and
i
made
that
rind
ball
here
,
let
me
let
me
compute
the
circumference
of
this
rind
ball
.
that
's
about
15
centimeters
.
so
the
circumference
of
my
ball
of
rind
is
about
15
centimeters
,
that
means
my
rind
ball
has
a
radius
.
15
over
2
pi
centimeters
.
and
here
,
assuming
my
rind
ball
is
a
perfect
sphere
.
this
would
be
the
volume
of
the
rind
ball
.
but
in
here
i
got
ta
put
the
radius
,
which
is
15
over
.
2
pie
.
so
,
4
3rds
pie
the
radius
cubed
,
and
that
's
about
57
cubic
centimeters
.
so
,
yeah
,
i
mean
,
i
actually
took
all
the
rind
off
the
orange
and
the
value
that
we
got
is
pretty
close
to
what
the
linear
approximation
told
us
the
volume
of
rind
should
be
.
this
perspective
sheds
some
light
on
what
might
otherwise
be
seen
as
just
some
random
coincidence
.
now
what
you
notice
is
that
the
volume
of
a
sphere
which
is
4
3rds
pi
r
cubed
and
the
surface
area
of
a
sphere
which
is
4
pi
r
squared
.
these
two
formulas
are
related
right
.
if
i
differentiate
this
volume
formula
with
respect
to
r
,
i
get
the
surface
area
.
formula
.
again
we
're
seeing
that
calculus
is
n't
really
about
solving
specific
problems
.
i
do
n't
care
about
the
volume
of
the
rind
of
this
orange
.
right
?
if
that
was
what
calculus
was
good
for
,
who
would
care
?
right
.
what
calculus
is
really
good
at
is
providing
a
general
framework
and
with
that
general
framework
we
can
begin
to
see
the
patterns
between
different
concepts
.
like
this
fact
,
the
surface
area
of
a
sphere
is
the
derivative
of
the
volume
of
a
sphere
with
respect
to
the
radius
.
that
's
not
really
a
coincidence
,
right
?
calculus
is
providing
an
explanation
for
that
supposed
coincidence
.
