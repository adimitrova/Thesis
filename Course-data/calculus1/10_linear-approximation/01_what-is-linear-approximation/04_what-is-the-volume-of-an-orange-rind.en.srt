1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,492
[music] Here, I've got an orange.
I'd like to measure say, the radius of the

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:11,275
orange, thinking of this orange as a
perfect sphere.

3
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:17,885
One way to do this would be to measure,
say, the circumference of the orange

4
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:23,282
around its equator.
So here if I measure that it looks like

5
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:29,798
it's about 24 centimeters.
So the circumference of the orange is 24

6
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:34,460
centimeters.
What does that tell me about, say the

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,727
radius of the orange?
Well that circumference Will be 2 pi times

8
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:44,019
the radius of the orange.
So if I divide both sides by 2 pi.

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,684
I get that the radius of the orange is
about 12 over pi centimeters.

10
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:53,793
How much rind is there on this orange?
That could be formulated as a linear

11
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,997
approximation problem.
Well let's fit this up./g So, I just

12
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:02,554
calculated the orange radius to be about
12 over pi centimeters.

13
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,378
I want to figure out how thick the rind
is.

14
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:08,901
Let me.
Let me peel off a bit of the orange here.

15
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:14,787
Just want to measure how thick this is
with, say my little ruler here and yeah,

16
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:19,512
maybe three millimeters.
So, point three centimeters will be the

17
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,547
rind thickness.
Now how does knowing the rind thickness

18
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:28,817
going to help me to calculate, at least
approximate, the volume of the rind in

19
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:33,302
this whole orange.
Well I know the volume of a sphere, which

20
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,584
by modeling the orange to be, is 4 3rds pi
r q.

21
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:42,046
And the rind volume, is at least
approximately how much the volume changes

22
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:45,976
when I take this formula, and replace r
with r minus h.

23
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:49,461
Right?
When I take that sphere and I make it just

24
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:54,073
a little bit smaller.
That change in volume is the volume of the

25
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,436
rind.
And to understand how wiggling the input

26
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:01,054
effects the output, I'm going to use the
derivative.

27
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,734
The formula that I want to be
differentiating here is this volume of a

28
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:10,041
sphere of radius r.
Which is 4 thirds pi r cubed [NOISE]And if

29
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:16,016
I differentiate this with respect to r.
The r cubed differentiates to 3r squared.

30
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:21,090
And the 3 in the denominator here will
cancel this 3 by the power rule.

31
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,254
So the derivative will be 4 pi r squared.
Now what I'm trying to approximate is the

32
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:33,113
rind volume which is really the difference
between a sphere of radius r and a

33
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:39,003
slightly smaller sphere where I've shrunk
down just past the rind, right.

34
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,685
That difference will be the volume of the
rind.

35
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:47,114
And approximately this h times the
derivitive of v at r.

36
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:52,130
Right, because this is asking how does the
output change when the input goes from R

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,448
minus H to R.
And it's approximately the input change

38
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:58,861
times the derivative.
Now in this case what do I know?

39
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,456
The orange's radius is 12 over Pi, so I'll
use that for R.

40
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:07,262
And the rind's thickness is point three
centimeters so I'm going to use that for

41
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:11,227
H.
So this is point three centimeters Times 4

42
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:17,266
pi, times this radius, which is 12 over pi
centimeters squared.

43
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:23,657
So this is cubic centimeters.
Well that's good because I'm trying to

44
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:29,481
calculate a volume.
And I'll just keep calculating here.

45
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:34,656
So it's point 3 times 4 pi times 144 over
pi squared.

46
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:41,388
Cubic centimeters.
And 4 times 144 is 576 times .3, the pi

47
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:47,945
divided the pi squared is going to be a pi
in the denominator.

48
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:52,913
So I've got .3 times 576 over pi Cubic
centimeters.

49
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:58,834
That's about 55 cubic centimeters.
So the volume of the rind is approximately

50
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:03,869
55 cubic centimeters.
Now admittedly I could have calculated the

51
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:09,133
volume of the rind just by calculating the
volume of the whole thing.

52
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:13,716
Calculating the volume of the whole thing
with the radius reduced by h, and taking a

53
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:16,563
difference.
But the neat thing here is that you can

54
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:19,597
approximate that quantity by using
calculus, right?

55
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:22,680
By thinking about this linear
approximation business.

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,796
I also want to see now how close the
linear approximation was.

57
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:31,886
Alright, so I've taken my orange and
peeled off all the rind, and I've taken

58
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:37,380
the rind and smooched it down into this
ball, and I'll try to calculate the volume

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,919
now of this rind ball.
I want to compute the volume of a rind,

60
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,569
and I made that rind ball here, let me Let
me compute the circumference of this rind

61
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,214
ball.
That's about 15 centimeters.

62
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:59,632
So the circumference of my ball of rind is
about 15 centimeters, that means my rind

63
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,868
ball has a radius.
15 over 2 pi centimeters.

64
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:08,167
And here, assuming my Rind ball is a
perfect sphere.

65
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:14,918
This would be the volume of the Rind ball.
But in here I gotta put the radius, which

66
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,837
is 15 over.
2 pie.

67
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:22,665
So, 4 3rds pie the radius cubed, and
that's about 57 cubic centimeters.

68
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:29,205
So, yeah, I mean, I actually took all the
rind off the orange and the value that we

69
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:35,937
got is pretty close to what the linear
approximation told us the volume of rind

70
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,407
should be.
This perspective sheds some light on what

71
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:42,998
might otherwise be seen as just some
random coincidence.

72
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:47,792
Now what you notice is that the volume of
a sphere which is 4 3rds pi r cubed and

73
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:51,043
the surface area of a sphere which is 4 pi
r squared.

74
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:55,907
These two formulas are related right.
If I differentiate this volume formula

75
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:59,142
with respect to r, I get the surface area.
Formula.

76
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:03,658
Again we're seeing that calculus isn't
really about solving specific problems.

77
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:06,835
I don't care about the volume of the rind
of this orange.

78
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:09,536
Right?
If that was what calculus was good for,

79
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,918
who would care?
Right.

80
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,414
What calculus is really good at Is
providing a general framework and with

81
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:22,835
that general framework we can begin to see
the patterns between different concepts.

82
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:28,921
Like this fact, the surface area of a
sphere is the derivative of the volume of

83
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:35,052
a sphere with respect to the radius.
That's not really a coincidence, right?

84
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:40,547
Calculus is providing an explanation for
that supposed coincidence.
