calculus is rich enough that theres a ton 

different ways to think concepts 
in calculus 
think derivative 
one way to think derivative is 

ratio output change to small, 
infinitesimal input change 
another way to think 
derivative, is in terms linear 
approximation 
thats idea that we want to 
exploit right 
this is really story of, 
calculus 
you know, you want to understand curved 
objects 
i want to understand graph a 
function thats curved 
thats hard to 
but, if i zoom in close enough 
functions graph right, if 
functions differentiable, i 
zoom in, 
that graph looks like a straight line 
thats idea linear approximation 
we study complicated curved 
graphs zooming 
in imagining that, least 
approximately, theyre straight lines 
theres a couple huge benefits to 
this 
one thing that we use this for, is to 
approximate values function 
thing that going to 
able to use this for, is newtons method 
well able to things like, 
least approximately, find roots 
complicated looking polynomials
