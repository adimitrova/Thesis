welcome back to calculus i welcome to 
week nine time together 
you believe that weve this 
two months already 
crazy 
last two weeks, weve really 
focusing applications derivative 
in a particular word problem 
right 
related rates problems 
optimization problems 
theyre word problems, stories real 
life 
this week, in week nine, still 
applications derivative, 
so much word problems anymore 
sort numerical applications 
in particular, going to look 
newtons method, is a way 
approximating a a function 
we that a while back 
using this bisection method an 
intermediate value theorem newtons 
method is, least works, much 
faster 
thing that going to 
look is knowing information 
derivative lets you recover 
numerical information original 
function 
so if you knew instance derivative 
you wanted to approximate a value a 
function, well see you that 
well i hope you enjoyed numerical 
examples 
when, i first took calculus i got to 
say that i didnt always enjoy 
numbers that coming up, you know 
i really wanted to 
theorems, you know 
i think numbers really make this 
subject come alive 
so i encourage you, if youre skeptical 
numerical stuff this week, 
take a look 
i think going to a lot fun
