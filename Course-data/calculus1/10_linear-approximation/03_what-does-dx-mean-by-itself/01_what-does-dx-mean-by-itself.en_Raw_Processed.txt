music weve seen dfdx weve seen 
ddx 
so now, going to think 
dx 
this sort object is called a 
differential 
inaudible dx ddx, right 
weve thought that little bit 
already, right 
an operator, this thing that 
differentiation 
this object is going to study 
right 
called a differential 
that even mean 
geometrically, differentials, so dy 
dx, represented change in 
linear approximation that i get using 
tangent line 
so here, ive got function that ive 
graphed, y equals f x 
heres a point, x, f x 
ive got a tangent line a curve 
there 
heres change in x, im 
calling dx, heres change in y, 
im calling dy 
if you think about, is 
derivative 
well, i mean derivative really is dy 
dx, right, in sense, you know 
if you take derivative multiply 
much input changed by, i mean, 
you dont actually get much output 
changed you get an approximation to 
much output changed 
this dy here is used as, this dy is 
change in linear approximation 
okay, heres a statement in words 
in words, dy is a change in 
linearization, linear 
approximation, tangent line 
approximation, to this function that 
youre thinking y, depending x 
thats dy is 
i emphasize that dys 
better include a dx in there somewhere 
different points in life, youll 
develop hm, different ideas dx 
dy really mean 
so, in a calculus class, in this calculus 
class, if you really want to, you 
think dx dy infinitesimal 
quantities, small quantities 
difficult to make this sort 
thinking entirely rigourous 
thats certainly an okay way to think 
if youre trying to get intuition 
things representing 
now, later in life, you take 
course, say, a differential geometry 
course, dx will given better 
foundation 
dx will revealed to a differential 
form a covector 
i mean, youll actual 
interpretation dx time 
being, you know, if you really want to, 
you regard things 
infinitesimal quantities 
honestly, i wouldnt worry much 
to actually think 
things focus to compute 
objects 
basic trick is that if y is f x, 
dy is derivative f dx, you 
dont even need necessarily to 
differentiate f in a lot cases 
differential satisfies many 
rules analogous rules 
differentiation satisfies 
so, example, d u v, u plus v 
i say, is du plus dv 
d u times v, is a product rule, is du 
times v plus u dv, right 
theres a quotient rule 
i mean, this differential satisfied 
lets say analogous rules 
to derivatives 
lets take a look an example 
example maybe y is something here like 
x squared and, in that case, whats dy 
well, dy is derivative x times dx 
yes, this relate change in x 
change in y in terms linearizations 
you dont even need necessarily to 
write this way 
you could if you wanted to write dx 
squared think that there is power 
rule a differential like usual 
power rule, says that this is 
x dx 
so, in general, d x to n would 
nx to n minus dx 
we cook a complicated example 
example, lets calculate d x sine 
x 
well, this is d a product i 
compute that using product rule 
differentials, right 
that tell 
well, will d first thing 
times second thing plus first 
thing times d second thing 
now, instead writing dx times sin x, i 
could write that sin x dx 
whats d sin x 
well, this is d a function 
remember, i take d a 
function 
well, derivative times dx 
so, this is x times derivative, 
is cosine x times dx 
now, if i like, i could factor dx 
i could write this sin x plus x cos 
x dx, now, i havent done anything 
new here, right 
i mean, i could differentiate x 
sin x point is im writing 
without ever, you know, taking derivative 
im sort using rule to 
compute differentials, right 
like differential product rule 
fact that differential a function 
is derivative dx 
im a little bit vague to 
deal differentials this 
point 
going to seeing 
differentials in coming weeks
