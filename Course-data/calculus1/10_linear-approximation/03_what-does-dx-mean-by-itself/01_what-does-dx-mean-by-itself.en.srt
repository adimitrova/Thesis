1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,196
[music] We've seen df/dx and we've seen
d/dx.

2
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:07,781
So now, we're going to think about just
dx.

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:11,976
This sort of object is called a
differential.

4
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:18,732
[inaudible] about dx not d/dx, right?
We've thought about that little bit

5
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:23,866
already, right?
As an operator, this the thing that does

6
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:28,656
the differentiation.
This object is what we're going to study

7
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,228
right now.
It's called a differential.

8
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:35,986
But what does that even mean?
Geometrically, these differentials, so dy

9
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:41,145
and dx, represented some change in the
linear approximation that I get using the

10
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,732
tangent line.
So here, I've got some function that I've

11
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:48,255
graphed, y equals f of x.
And here's a point, x, f of x.

12
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:51,311
And I've got a tangent line with a curve
there.

13
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:55,906
And here's some change in x, which I'm
calling dx, and here's some change in y,

14
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:59,170
which I'm calling dy.
And if you think about, what is the

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,324
derivative?
Well, I mean the derivative really is dy

16
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:07,390
over dx, right, in some sense, you know.
If you take the derivative and multiply it

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,558
by how much the input changed by, I mean,
you don't actually get how much the output

18
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:17,726
changed by but you get an approximation to
how much the output changed by and as for

19
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:23,068
this dy here is being used as, this dy is
the change in the linear approximation.

20
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:27,764
Okay, here's a statement in words.
In words, dy is a change in the

21
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:32,604
linearization, or the linear
approximation, or the tangent line

22
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:38,354
approximation, to this function that
you're thinking of as y, depending on x.

23
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:42,781
That's what dy is.
I should emphasize that your dy's had

24
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:49,229
better include a dx in there somewhere.
At different points in your life, you'll

25
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,116
develop hm, different ideas about what dx
and dy really mean.

26
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:58,696
So, in a Calculus class, in this Calculus
class, if you really want to, you can

27
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:03,064
think of dx and dy as infinitesimal
quantities, very small quantities.

28
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:06,969
It's difficult to make this sort of
thinking entirely rigourous.

29
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:11,667
But that's certainly an okay way to think
if you're trying to get some intuition for

30
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,987
what these things are representing.
Now, later on in your life, when you take

31
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:20,537
some course, say, a differential geometry
course, dx will then be given some better

32
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:24,004
foundation.
Dx will be revealed to be a differential

33
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,822
form or a covector.
I mean, you'll have some actual

34
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:30,917
interpretation of dx but for the time
being, you know, if you really want to,

35
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,211
you can regard these things as
infinitesimal quantities.

36
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:39,233
But honestly, I wouldn't worry too much
about how to actually think about these

37
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,977
things and focus more on how to compute
with these objects.

38
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:48,811
The basic trick is that if y is f of x,
then dy is the derivative of f dx, and you

39
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,799
don't even need necessarily to
differentiate f in a lot cases.

40
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:00,589
The differential satisfies many of the
same rules or analogous rules as just

41
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:07,456
differentiation satisfies.
So, for example, d of u and v, or u plus v

42
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:13,982
I should say, is du plus dv.
D of u times v, is a product rule, is du

43
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:19,416
times v plus u dv, right?
And there's a quotient rule.

44
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:26,184
I mean, this differential satisfied all
the same or let's just say analogous rules

45
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,888
to derivatives.
Let's take a look at an example.

46
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:35,943
For example maybe y is something here like
x squared and, in that case, what's dy?

47
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:42,197
Well, dy is the derivative 2x times dx and
yes, this does relate some change in x and

48
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:48,097
change in y in terms of linearizations.
But you don't even need necessarily to

49
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:51,803
write it this way.
You could if you wanted to write dx

50
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:57,823
squared and then think that there is power
rule of a differential just like the usual

51
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:01,143
power rule, which then says that this is
2x dx.

52
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:05,906
So, in general, d of x to the n would be
nx to the n minus 1 dx.

53
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:12,360
We can cook up a more complicated example.
For example, let's calculate d of x sine

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,221
x.
Well, this is d of a product and I can

55
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:20,291
compute that by using the product rule for
differentials, right?

56
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,875
What does that tell me?
Well, it will be d of the first thing

57
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:30,617
times the second thing plus the first
thing times d of the second thing.

58
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:35,740
Now, instead of writing dx times sin x, I
could write that as sin x dx.

59
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,734
And what's d of sin of x?
Well, this is d of a function.

60
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:42,939
And remember, how do I take d of a
function?

61
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:49,879
Well, it's the derivative times dx.
So, this is x times the derivative, which

62
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:55,145
is cosine x times dx.
Now, if I like, I could factor out the dx

63
00:04:55,145 --> 00:05:01,130
and I could write this as sin x plus x cos
x dx, now, because I haven't done anything

64
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,390
new here, right?
I mean, I could have just differentiate x

65
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,375
sin x but the point is I'm writing it down
without ever, you know, taking derivative.

66
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:16,653
I'm sort of using the rule for how to
compute differentials, right?

67
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:23,589
Like the differential product rule and the
fact that the differential of a function

68
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,489
is the derivative dx.
I'm being a little bit vague with how to

69
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:32,206
deal with these differentials at this
point.

70
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:38,399
But we're going to be seeing more of these
differentials in the coming weeks.
