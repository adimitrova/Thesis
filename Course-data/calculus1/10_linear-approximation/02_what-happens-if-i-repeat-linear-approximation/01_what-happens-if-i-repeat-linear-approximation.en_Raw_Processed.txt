music well here is a linear 
approximation problem 
so ive got function f 
you dont know that function 
immediately, i know derivative is 
equal to functions value, say 
x 
lets suppose that i know this 
functions value zero 
so this functions value is , 
goal is to find f 
we secretly know something, right 
i mean, i secretly know that this function 
is really e to x 
so i say find f 
i really mean that im trying to calculate 
e to first power, im trying to 
calculate e 
point, here, you know, isnt to 
say that answer is e, right 
point is going to to try to 
approximate this quantity without actually 
knowing value e 
we already know to this 
we use linear approximation, 
right 
i want to know f is, 
linear approximation business, well 
equal to, approximately 
value 
plus much i change input times 
derivative 
i know functions value 
functions value is 
since derivative is equal to 
value everywhere, that means i also know 
derivative is 
so functions value is , 
derivative is function 
value , is 
plus times is so approximately f 
is 
since i secretly know that this 
function is e to x, im saying that e 
is , is a terrible approximation 
we better 
if we approximation once, we 
a bunch time 
so instead this jumping way to 
, lets first approximate f half 
that will f , plus much i wiggled 
is half times derivative 
well, f is still , half is a half 
derivative is still 
so this is plus a half, this is 
halves 
we use data approximation to 
approximate f 
yes, im sort bootstrapping here, 
i want to know f least 
approximately 
instead starting , im going to 
start half 
so that will f half, 
admittedly i dont know i got this 
approximation 
plus much i changed to go half 
to times derivative one half 
f one half is approximately this 
three halves, one half derivative 
one half i dont really know is 
i still know that derivative is 
equal to functions value ive got an 
approximation functions value 
so i use that approximation here 
derivative one half is 
halves 
ive got halves 
ive got quarters 
that ends th, is a 
slightly better approximation to 
functions value one 
i mean, nine fourths is closer to 
actual value e 
well if two steps worked better one 
step, ten steps will work even better 
so here we go, lets approximate this 
function 
well thats approximately function 
value plus much i change 
input times derivative 
function value is plus times 
derivative is 
so approximately, e to is 
i repeat this process, i want to know 
exactly whats functions value 
that functions value 
plus times derivative 
so approximately function values 
point is plus times 
derivative , is about, no, see 
this in fact function values 
is 
so plus times , kind a 
mouthful 
that ends 
to approximate function value 
right, ill start functions 
value 
i go to adding 
i multiply derivative, 
functions value is plus 
times derivative , is 
also , times plus 
times , thats 
you might begin to see a pattern here, 
right 
, , , pieces 
pascals triangle, really 
i mean that makes sense considering 
im adding number plus times 
number 
lets keep going 
so lets compute f , thats f 
plus times derivative 
well, approximation here f 
is plus times , is, 
i this to get an 
approximation 
right, im really taking this number 
adding times i get 
thing to approximate 
i get 
thing to approximate , 
take this number add this number 
times , is 
game, approximate f 
so i take this number add times 
this number 
i get thing 
a 
so this number plus times this number 
i get last 
i take this number add times this 
number, i get , 
approximately e 
well, so great 
i mean, its, you know, much closer to 
previous attempts, i used 
two steps, you know 
so using ten steps is better, this 
technique repeated linear approximation 
a name 
so instead calling this you know 
repeated linear approximation people 
usually call this euler method 
lets summarize algorithm 
so this is a set 
ive got a formula derivative 
f, in terms f x 
so this cloud represents formula that 
involves f x x thats 
formula derivative f x 
lets say i know value f 
zero 
number suppose ive picked 
small number h 
well euler method tells to do, is 
i want to know f h, well i already know 
to that 
right, thats linear approximation 
f zero plus h times derivative 
zero 
i use this formula, say to calculate 
derivative f zero 
i know value f zero 
so i get an approximation to 
functions value h 
neat thing is i an keep playing 
this game, right 
if i want to know an approximate value to 
function times h, well thats 
functions value h plus h times 
derivative h 
i know functions value h 
approximately 
i know derivative h, 
ive got a formula derivative in 
terms f x, i know to 
calculate f h, approximately, i 
know x, right, h in this case 
that means that i get an 
approximation to f h ill 
keep playing this game 
if i want to know f h, well thats 
f h plus h times f prime h, 
so thats that linear approximation 
formula 
to go h to h, i add h so f h is 
approximately functions value h 
ive already approximated, plus 
much i change input by, times 
derivative h 
this i also approximate, 
formula derivative 
involves things i already know least 
approximately 
right, i know value f h 
approximately 
i keep repeating this to 
move to 
right and, you know, approximate values 
function that tend to get far 
away zero 
cool thing here is that im using, you 
know, linear approximation in stage 
im using information 
previous stages to approximate 
functions value, also to 
approximate functions derivative 
i wan you that in really world, 
people dont really use euler method 
so often 
like really great mathematical 
idea, theres a ton different riffs 
that you play this basic framework 
example since this is going to 
end an approximation 
derivative anyhow, sometimes better 
to pick a point is way 
left hand side interval im 
approximating 
so sometimes youll see that say instead 
using zero here, i might use h 
instead using h, is really 
left hand side interval between h 
h 
youll see that sometimes people will use, 
say halves h, is smack in 
middle h h 
say instead using h here, people 
will sometimes use halves h, is 
right in between h h 
so you play games, say 
choosing a different point to approximate 
derivative at, using midpoint 
is sometimes better 
incidentally, if youve got 
programming experience, id encourage you 
to try to write a program to euler 
method 
really fun to able to see 
calculations come alive
