well
here
is
a
linear
approximation
problem
.
so
i
've
got
some
function
f.
and
you
do
n't
know
that
function
immediately
,
but
i
know
it
's
derivative
is
equal
to
the
function
's
value
,
say
at
all
x.
and
let
's
suppose
that
i
know
this
function
's
value
at
zero
.
so
this
function
's
value
at
0
is
1
,
and
then
my
goal
is
to
find
f
of
1.
now
we
secretly
know
something
,
right
?
i
mean
,
i
secretly
know
that
this
function
is
really
e
to
the
x.
so
when
i
say
find
f
of
1.
i
really
mean
that
i
'm
trying
to
calculate
e
to
the
first
power
,
i
'm
trying
to
calculate
e.
the
point
,
here
,
you
know
,
is
n't
to
the
say
that
answer
is
e
,
right
?
the
point
is
going
to
be
to
try
to
approximate
this
quantity
without
actually
knowing
the
value
of
e.
we
already
know
how
to
do
this
.
we
can
use
linear
approximation
,
all
right
.
i
want
to
know
what
f
of
1
is
,
and
by
the
linear
approximation
business
,
well
it
's
not
equal
to
,
but
it
's
approximately
the
value
at
0.
plus
how
much
i
change
the
input
by
times
the
derivative
at
0.
now
i
know
the
function
's
value
at
0.
the
function
's
value
at
0
is
1.
and
since
the
derivative
is
equal
to
the
value
everywhere
,
that
means
i
also
know
the
derivative
is
0.
so
the
function
's
value
is
1
,
the
derivative
at
0
is
the
same
as
function
value
at
0
,
which
is
1
.
1
plus
1
times
1
is
2
so
approximately
f
of
1
is
2.
and
since
i
secretly
know
that
this
function
is
e
to
the
x
,
i
'm
saying
that
e
is
about
2
,
2
is
a
terrible
approximation
but
we
can
do
better
.
if
we
can
do
any
approximation
once
,
we
can
do
it
a
bunch
of
time
.
so
instead
of
this
jumping
all
the
way
to
1
,
let
's
first
approximate
f
of
1
half
and
that
will
f
of
0
,
plus
how
much
i
wiggled
by
which
is
1
half
times
the
derivative
at
well
,
f
of
0
is
still
1
,
1
half
is
a
half
and
the
derivative
at
0
is
still
1.
so
this
is
1
plus
a
half
,
this
is
3
halves
.
now
we
use
data
approximation
to
approximate
f
of
1.
yes
,
i
'm
sort
of
bootstrapping
up
here
,
now
i
want
to
know
f
of
1
at
least
approximately
.
but
instead
of
starting
at
0
,
i
'm
going
to
start
at
1
half
.
so
that
will
be
about
f
of
1
half
,
which
admittedly
i
do
n't
know
but
i
got
this
approximation
for
it
.
plus
how
much
i
changed
to
go
from
1
half
to
1
times
the
derivative
at
one
half
.
now
f
of
one
half
is
approximately
this
three
halves
,
one
half
and
the
derivative
of
one
half
i
do
n't
really
know
what
it
is
but
i
still
know
that
the
derivative
is
equal
to
function
's
value
and
i
've
got
an
approximation
of
the
function
's
value
.
so
i
can
use
that
approximation
here
at
the
derivative
at
one
half
is
about
3
halves
.
and
i
've
got
3
halves
.
and
i
've
got
3
quarters
.
that
ends
up
being
9
4th
,
which
is
a
slightly
better
approximation
to
the
function
's
value
of
one
.
i
mean
,
nine
fourths
is
closer
to
the
actual
value
of
e.
well
if
two
steps
worked
better
than
one
step
,
ten
steps
will
work
even
better
.
so
here
we
go
,
let
's
approximate
this
function
at
0.1.
well
that
's
approximately
the
function
value
at
0
plus
how
much
i
change
the
input
by
times
the
derivative
at
0
and
the
function
value
at
0
is
1
plus
0.1
times
derivative
of
0
is
1.
so
approximately
,
e
to
the
0.1
is
about
now
i
repeat
this
process
,
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
's
the
function
's
value
at
that
should
be
about
the
function
's
value
at
0.1
plus
0.1
times
the
derivative
at
so
approximately
the
function
values
at
point
0.1
is
about
1.1
plus
0.1
times
derivative
at
0.1
,
which
is
about
,
no
,
see
this
in
fact
the
function
values
at
0.1
which
is
about
1.1.
so
1.1
plus
0.1
times
1.1
,
it
's
kind
of
a
mouthful
.
but
that
ends
up
being
1.21.
now
to
approximate
the
function
value
at
all
right
,
i
'll
start
with
the
function
's
value
at
0.2.
i
go
from
0.2
to
0.3
by
adding
0.1.
and
then
i
multiply
by
the
derivative
,
at
the
function
's
value
at
0.2
is
1.21
plus
0.1
times
the
derivative
of
0.2
,
which
is
also
about
1.21
,
and
1.21
times
1.21
plus
0.1
times
1.21
,
that
's
1.331.
now
you
might
begin
to
see
a
pattern
here
,
right
?
1.1
,
1.21
,
1.331
,
these
are
pieces
of
pascal
's
triangle
,
really
.
i
mean
that
makes
sense
considering
how
.
how
i
'm
adding
the
number
plus
0.1
times
the
number
.
lets
just
keep
going
.
so
let
's
compute
f
of
0.4
,
that
's
f
of
0.3
plus
0.1
times
the
derivative
of
0.3.
well
,
the
approximation
here
for
f
of
0.3
is
1.331
plus
0.1
times
1.331
,
which
is
,
now
i
can
do
this
again
to
get
an
approximation
for
0.5.
right
,
i
'm
really
just
taking
this
number
and
adding
0.1
times
it
and
i
get
1.61051.
can
do
the
same
thing
to
approximate
0.6
and
i
get
1.771561.
can
do
the
same
thing
to
approximate
0.7
,
and
take
this
number
and
add
this
number
times
0.1
,
which
is
1.9487171.
do
the
same
game
,
do
approximate
f
of
0.8
?
so
i
take
this
number
and
add
0.1
times
this
number
.
and
i
get
2.14358881
can
do
the
same
thing
now
a
0.9.
so
this
number
plus
0.1
times
this
number
and
i
get
2.357947691
and
last
.
i
take
this
number
and
add
0.1
times
this
number
,
and
i
get
2.5937424601
,
approximately
e.
well
,
not
so
great
.
but
i
mean
,
it
's
,
you
know
,
much
closer
to
my
previous
attempts
,
where
i
just
used
two
steps
,
you
know
.
so
using
ten
steps
is
better
,
this
technique
of
repeated
linear
approximation
has
a
name
.
so
instead
of
calling
this
you
know
repeated
linear
approximation
people
usually
call
this
the
euler
method
.
lets
summarize
the
algorithm
.
so
this
is
a
set
up
.
i
've
got
a
formula
for
the
derivative
of
f
,
just
in
terms
of
f
and
x.
so
this
cloud
represents
some
formula
that
involves
f
of
x
and
x
and
that
's
my
formula
for
the
derivative
of
f
at
x.
and
let
's
say
i
know
the
value
of
f
at
zero
.
just
some
number
and
suppose
i
've
picked
some
small
number
h.
well
what
euler
method
tells
me
to
do
,
is
i
want
to
know
f
of
h
,
well
i
already
know
how
to
do
that
.
right
,
that
's
just
linear
approximation
.
it
's
f
of
zero
plus
h
times
the
derivative
at
zero
.
i
can
use
this
formula
,
say
to
calculate
the
derivative
of
f
at
zero
.
and
i
know
the
value
of
f
at
zero
.
so
i
can
get
an
approximation
to
the
function
's
value
h.
now
the
neat
thing
is
i
an
keep
playing
this
game
,
right
?
if
i
want
to
know
an
approximate
value
to
the
function
at
2
times
h
,
well
that
's
about
the
function
's
value
h
plus
h
times
the
derivative
at
h.
and
now
i
know
the
function
's
value
at
h
approximately
.
and
i
know
the
derivative
at
h
,
because
i
've
got
a
formula
for
the
derivative
in
terms
of
f
and
x
,
and
i
know
how
to
calculate
f
of
h
,
approximately
,
and
i
know
x
,
all
right
,
it
's
h
in
this
case
.
and
that
means
that
i
can
get
an
approximation
to
f
of
2h
and
i
'll
just
keep
playing
this
game
.
if
i
want
to
know
f
of
3h
,
well
that
's
about
f
of
2h
plus
h
times
f
prime
of
2h
,
so
that
's
that
linear
approximation
formula
again
.
to
go
from
2h
to
3h
,
i
add
h
so
f
of
3h
is
approximately
my
function
's
value
with
2h
which
i
've
already
approximated
,
plus
how
much
i
change
the
input
by
,
times
the
derivative
of
2h
.
and
this
i
can
also
approximate
,
because
my
formula
for
the
derivative
just
involves
things
i
already
know
at
least
approximately
.
right
,
i
know
the
value
of
f
at
2h
approximately
.
and
i
can
just
keep
on
repeating
this
to
move
myself
further
and
further
to
the
right
and
,
you
know
,
approximate
values
of
the
function
that
tend
to
get
very
far
away
from
zero
.
the
cool
thing
here
is
that
i
'm
using
,
you
know
,
linear
approximation
in
each
stage
.
and
then
i
'm
using
the
information
from
previous
stages
not
only
to
approximate
the
function
's
value
,
but
also
to
approximate
the
function
's
derivative
.
i
should
wan
you
that
in
the
really
world
,
people
do
n't
really
use
the
euler
method
so
often
.
but
like
any
really
great
mathematical
idea
,
there
's
a
ton
of
different
riffs
that
you
can
play
on
this
basic
framework
.
for
example
since
this
is
just
going
to
end
up
being
an
approximation
of
the
derivative
anyhow
,
it
's
sometimes
better
not
to
pick
a
point
which
is
all
the
way
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
interval
i
'm
approximating
over
.
so
sometimes
you
'll
see
that
say
instead
of
using
zero
here
,
i
might
use
h
over
2.
instead
of
using
h
,
which
is
really
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
interval
between
h
and
2h
.
you
'll
see
that
sometimes
people
will
use
,
say
3
halves
h
,
which
is
smack
in
the
middle
of
h
and
2h
.
and
say
instead
of
using
2h
here
,
people
will
sometimes
use
5
halves
h
,
which
is
right
in
between
2h
and
3h
.
so
you
can
play
some
games
,
say
by
choosing
a
different
point
to
approximate
the
derivative
at
,
and
using
the
midpoint
is
sometimes
better
.
incidentally
,
if
you
've
got
some
programming
experience
,
i
'd
encourage
you
to
try
to
write
a
program
to
do
the
euler
method
.
it
's
really
fun
to
be
able
to
see
these
calculations
come
alive
.
