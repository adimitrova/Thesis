1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,371
[music] Well here is a linear
approximation problem.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:09,314
So I've got some function F.
And you don't know that function

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:16,174
immediately, but I know it's derivative is
equal to the function's value, say at all

4
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:19,117
X.
And let's suppose that I know this

5
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:24,722
function's value at zero.
So this function's value at 0 is 1, and

6
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:30,793
then my goal is to find f of 1.
Now we secretly know something, right?

7
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:36,344
I mean, I secretly know that this function
is really e to the x.

8
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:41,027
So when I say find f of 1.
I really mean that I'm trying to calculate

9
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,846
e to the first power, I'm trying to
calculate e.

10
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:47,896
The point, here, you know, isn't to the
say that answer is e, right?

11
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:52,830
The point is going to be to try to
approximate this quantity without actually

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,315
knowing the value of e.
We already know how to do this.

13
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,290
We can use linear approximation, all
right.

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,831
I want to know what f of 1 is, and by the
linear approximation business, well it's

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,500
not equal to, but it's approximately the
value at 0.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:13,027
Plus how much I change the input by times
the derivative at 0.

17
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:17,522
Now I know the function's value at 0.
The function's value at 0 is 1.

18
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:22,888
And since the derivative is equal to the
value everywhere, that means I also know

19
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:26,699
the derivative is 0.
So the function's value is 1, the

20
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:31,250
derivative at 0 is the same as function
value at 0, which is 1.

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,779
1 plus 1 times 1 is 2 so approximately f
of 1 is 2.

22
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:40,275
And since I secretly know that this
function is e to the x, I'm saying that e

23
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:44,900
is about 2, 2 is a terrible approximation
but we can do better.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,728
If we can do any approximation once, we
can do it a bunch of time.

25
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,723
So instead of this jumping all the way to
1, let's first approximate f of 1 half and

26
00:01:56,723 --> 00:02:03,521
that will f of 0, plus how much I wiggled
by which is 1 half times the derivative at

27
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,397
0.
Well, f of 0 is still 1, 1 half is a half

28
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:11,054
and the derivative at 0 is still 1.
So this is 1 plus a half, this is 3

29
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:13,789
halves.
Now we use data approximation to

30
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:17,677
approximate f of 1.
Yes, I'm sort of bootstrapping up here,

31
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:20,747
now I want to know f of 1 at least
approximately.

32
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:24,528
But instead of starting at 0, I'm going to
start at 1 half.

33
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:29,556
So that will be about f of 1 half, which
admittedly I don't know but I got this

34
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:34,126
approximation for it.
Plus how much I changed to go from 1 half

35
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:39,543
to 1 times the derivative at one half.
Now f of one half is approximately this

36
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:45,187
three halves, one half and the derivative
of one half I don't really know what it is

37
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:50,665
but I still know that the derivative is
equal to function's value and I've got an

38
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:56,567
approximation of the function's value.
So I can use that approximation here at

39
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,947
the derivative at one half Is about 3
halves.

40
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,651
And I've got 3 halves.
And I've got 3 quarters.

41
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:08,817
That ends up being 9 4th, which is a
slightly better approximation to the

42
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:13,099
function's value of one.
I mean, nine fourths is closer to the

43
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,989
actual value of e.
Well if two steps worked better than one

44
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,556
step, ten steps will work even better.
So here we go, let's approximate this

45
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:27,166
function at 0.1.
Well that's approximately the function

46
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:33,214
value at 0 plus how much I change the
input by times the derivative at 0 and the

47
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:37,887
function value at 0 is 1 plus 0.1 times
derivative of 0 is 1.

48
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:41,216
So approximately, E to the 0.1 is about
1.1.

49
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:47,690
Now I repeat this process, I want to know
exactly what's the function's value at

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,507
0.2.
That should be about the function's value

51
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:55,079
at 0.1 plus 0.1 times the derivative at
0.1.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,333
So approximately the function values at
point 0.1 is about 1.1 plus 0.1 times

53
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:07,564
derivative at 0.1, which is about, no, see
this in fact the function values at 0.1

54
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:12,231
which is about 1.1.
So 1.1 plus 0.1 times 1.1, it's kind of a

55
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,381
mouthful.
But that ends up being 1.21.

56
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,116
Now to approximate the function value at
0.3.

57
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:23,876
All right, I'll start with the function's
value at 0.2.

58
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:30,131
I go from 0.2 to 0.3 by adding 0.1.
And then I multiply by the derivative, at

59
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:34,113
0.2.
The function's value at 0.2 is 1.21 plus

60
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:41,389
0.1 times the derivative of 0.2, which is
also about 1.21, and 1.21 times 1.21 plus

61
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,254
0.1 times 1.21, that's 1.331.
Now you might begin to see a pattern here,

62
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:52,350
right?
1.1, 1.21, 1.331, these are pieces of

63
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,775
Pascal's triangle, really.
I mean that makes sense considering how.

64
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:03,576
How I'm adding the number plus 0.1 times
the number.

65
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:09,293
Lets just keep going.
So let's compute f of 0.4, that's f of 0.3

66
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:16,668
plus 0.1 times the derivative of 0.3.
Well, the approximation here for f of 0.3

67
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:21,590
is 1.331 plus 0.1 times 1.331, which is,
1.4641.

68
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,595
Now I can do this again to get an
approximation for 0.5.

69
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:34,998
Right, I'm really just taking this number
and adding 0.1 times it and I get 1.61051.

70
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:43,298
Can do the same thing to approximate 0.6
and I get 1.771561.

71
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:52,416
Can do the same thing to approximate 0.7,
and take this number and add this number

72
00:05:52,416 --> 00:06:00,065
times 0.1, which is 1.9487171.
Do the same game, do approximate f of 0.8?

73
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:05,061
So I take this number and add 0.1 times
this number.

74
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:13,346
And I get 2.14358881 can do the same thing
now a 0.9.

75
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:24,258
So this number plus 0.1 times this number
and I get 2.357947691 and last.

76
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:30,662
I take this number and add 0.1 times this
number, and I get 2.5937424601,

77
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:34,021
approximately e.
Well, not so great.

78
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:41,517
But I mean, it's, you know, much closer to
my previous attempts, where I just used

79
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:45,919
two steps, you know.
So using ten steps is better, this

80
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,290
technique of repeated linear approximation
has a name.

81
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,070
So instead of calling this you know
repeated linear approximation people

82
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,479
usually call this the Euler method.
Lets summarize the algorithm.

83
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,428
So this is a set up.
I've got a formula for the derivative of

84
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:07,991
f, just in terms of f and x.
So this cloud represents some formula that

85
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:12,565
involves f of x and x and that's my
formula for the derivative of f at x.

86
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,324
And let's say I know the value of f at
zero.

87
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:19,393
Just some number and suppose I've picked
some small number H.

88
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:24,794
Well what Euler method tells me to do, is
I want to know F of H, well I already know

89
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:28,570
how to do that.
Right, that's just linear approximation.

90
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,822
It's f of zero plus h times the derivative
at zero.

91
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:36,179
I can use this formula, say to calculate
the derivative of F at zero.

92
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:40,404
And I know the value of f at zero.
So I can get an approximation to the

93
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:44,059
function's value H.
Now the neat thing is I an keep playing

94
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:47,867
this game, right?
If I want to know an approximate value to

95
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:53,067
the function at 2 times h, well that's
about the function's value h plus h times

96
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:57,133
the derivative at h.
And now I know the function's value at h

97
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,106
approximately.
And I know the derivative at h, because

98
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:06,180
I've got a formula for the derivative in
terms of f and x, and I know how to

99
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,787
calculate f of h, approximately, and I
know x, all right, it's h in this case.

100
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:16,490
And that means that I can get an
approximation to f of 2h and I'll just

101
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,543
keep playing this game.
If I want to know f of 3h, well that's

102
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:25,689
about f of 2h plus h times f prime of 2h,
so that's that linear approximation

103
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,089
formula again.
To go from 2h to 3h, I add h so f of 3h is

104
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:34,777
approximately my function's value with 2h
which I've already approximated, plus how

105
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:38,435
much I change the input by, times the
derivative of 2h.

106
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,662
And this I can also approximate, because
my formula for the derivative just

107
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:45,830
involves things I already know at least
approximately.

108
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,610
Right, I know the value of f at 2h
approximately.

109
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,968
And I can just keep on repeating this to
move myself further and further to the

110
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:57,524
right and, you know, approximate values of
the function that tend to get very far

111
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:01,086
away from zero.
The cool thing here is that I'm using, you

112
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:05,949
know, linear approximation in each stage.
And then I'm using the information from

113
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,227
previous stages not only to approximate
the function's value, but also to

114
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:15,494
approximate the function's derivative.
I should wan you that in the really world,

115
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:18,780
people don't really use the Euler method
so often.

116
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,141
But like any really great mathematical
idea, there's a ton of different riffs

117
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:28,447
that you can play on this basic framework.
For example since this is just going to

118
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:33,661
end up being an approximation of the
derivative anyhow, it's sometimes better

119
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:39,191
not to pick a point which is all the way
on the left hand side of the interval I'm

120
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:43,209
approximating over.
So sometimes you'll see that say instead

121
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,840
of using zero here, I might use h over 2.
Instead of using h, which is really on the

122
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,255
left hand side of the interval between h
and 2h.

123
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:57,071
You'll see that sometimes people will use,
say 3 halves h, which is smack in the

124
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:00,630
middle of h and 2h.
And say instead of using 2h here, people

125
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,644
will sometimes use 5 halves h, which is
right in between 2h and 3h.

126
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:10,194
So you can play some games, say by
choosing a different point to approximate

127
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:14,872
the derivative at, and using the midpoint
is sometimes better.

128
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:22,223
Incidentally, if you've got some
programming experience, I'd encourage you

129
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:26,704
to try to write a program to do the Euler
method.

130
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:32,747
It's really fun to be able to see these
calculations come alive.
