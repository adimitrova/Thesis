music im going to approximate log 
natural log starting log 
of, , i know to moving 
one quarter time until 
four steps i arrive 
so here we go 
first ill try to approximate log 
plus a quarter 
this will approximately log plus a 
quarter, is much i changed 
input by, times, i gotta approximate 
derivative somehow 
i dont really want to approximate 
derivative log , i dont really 
want to approximate derivative log 
ths 
that will an estimate 
derivative whole interval 
so, im going to approximate 
derivative evaluating derivative in 
middle this region plus an 
th 
alright derivative log is over, 
so this is derivative log in 
middle interval between 
alright 
so lets keep calculating here 
log is zero 
plus a th times, whats plus an 
th, plus an th is ths, so thats a 
th times ths 
since im taking reciprocal 
that is ths, so log ths, 
according to this is ths 
i keep going right 
i want to approximate log one plus 
a quarter plus a quarter 
well, thatll log plus a 
quarter, is i calculated, 
plus a quarter times, i gotta write 
derivative, and, again, im going 
to pick derivative middle 
this interval 
so, ill evaluate derivative plus 
ths is right in between plus a 
quarter plus quarters 
i approximated log plus a quarter to 
nineth plus a th times, whats this 
plus ths 
well, that turns to ths 
im taking reciprocal so ill 
write ths 
so ive got ths plus ths 
that works to ths 
so thats approximately log 
lets keep going 
whats log plus quarters 
well, that log plus 
quarters plus much input changes to go 
here to here, is a quarter 
times derivative 
now, i want to approximate 
derivative 
ill approximate in middle 
interval 
so, itll plus ths 
well whats this 
a log plus quarters, log , i 
approximated that to ths plus 
a quarter times plus ths, thats 
ths 
reciprocal is th 
so this is ths plus ths 
this is going to a, a huge number 
turns , 
and, thats approximately log 
now, here we go 
whats log 
well, that log 
so, quarters plus quarter, so 
thats much input change is to go 
here to here, times derivative 
im going to approximate 
plus th, right 
im going to approximate derivative in 
middle this interval 
this turn to 
well, i approximated this 
that plus a quarter 
times plus th 
thats th 
so th reciprocal 
so, thats plus th 
turns to , is 
approximately 
that is really great log is 
actually closer to is 
awfully close to 
really fantastic that, you know, 
paper, right 
im able to get a good approximation 
to log 
lets use this euler method, 
precisely, midpoint method, to 
approximate log 
i use a little bit bigger step size here 
to save us time 
im going to put this gain to, to 
approximate log 
lets first log 
writing log log i move 
to adding , so ill add times 
derivative, i gotta pick 
ill evaluate derivative 
i dont want to evaluate derivative 
log , i want to in between, 
so would plus a half 
so log is plus plus a half is 
halves, theres a reciprocal, so 
thats rd 
so this is telling that log is 
rds 
i trick a 
step size , so log is log plus 
, is much i change going 
to times derivative, 
approximation derivative somewhere, 
ill in between so itll 
one plus a right 
thats a point in between 
i approximated log to rds 
plus a half 
thats halves, reciprocal, thats 
ths 
rds plus ths, common denominator 
, is th is 
this actually compare to log , 
well log is actually , so i 
mean seriously, is a bad 
guess, compared to blah, blah, 
blah, right 
in here i used steps a 
whole step size here , right 
so this is even a coarser approximation 
a, thing i used to approximate 
log 
lets compute log log or, if 
you like, log base 
so log log is , 
keeps going, right 
you might notice here is that 
ths is 
pretty close 
we rephrase this without using 
logarithms 
so im saying here is that log 
log is ths 
well if this is true, that means that 
times log is times log 
properties logs, times log 
is log to th log 
is log to th 
if logarithms approximately 
equal, youd think that to th 
would approximately to th 
yes, sure enough to th is , 
to th is 
numbers arent so different 
this turns to maybe 
significant seems first 
lets play around this 
numbers , , halves, , theyre 
significant musically 
alright 
two notes that separated a th 
actually in a ratio to in terms 
frequencies 
here, listen to two notes that 
separated a th 
two notes a th apart 
listen to two notes that an octave 
apart 
two notes an octave apart 
frequencys in a ratio two to 
one 
deal is that fifths is 
seven octaves 
twelve fifths, thats like three halves, 
thats ratio a fifth to 
twelfth power is close to two to 
seventh power, close to seven octaves 
here, lets, lets listen to th in a 
row 
so that is th listen to seven 
octaves, starting note 
notice that last note, right 
theyre close to 
thats really an audio proof that 
halves to th power is almost two to 
seventh power
