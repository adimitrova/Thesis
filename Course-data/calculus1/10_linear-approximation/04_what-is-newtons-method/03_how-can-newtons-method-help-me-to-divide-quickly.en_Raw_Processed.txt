music youve already seen a few 
different techniques to multiply 
quickly 
techniques include 
quartersquares, using logarithms a 
sliderule 
that method prosthaphaeresis, 
involves arc cosine 
so yeah, theres a ton different 
techniques that i use to multiply two 
numbers quickly 
if i could already multiply 
quickly, i wanted to divide quickly 
if i wanted to calculate divided 
b 
well, we use newtons method to 
this 
now, going to use newtons 
method 
well, newtons method is really a trick 
finding zeroes a function 
so, if i want to approximate one divided 
b, reciprocal b, i really 
want to find is function that 
number is a zero function 
newtons method will help approximate 
that zero consequently help 
approximate b 
theres a ton different choices that 
possible a function 
well, heres one choice 
function f x equals x minus 
b 
lets check, yeah, if i evaluate 
this function b, thats 
b minus b 
b, reciprocal 
reciprocal b, is b 
b minus b is in fact 
so, this function f b 
a 
lets apply newtons method 
so we going to this 
here is formula newtons method, 
right 
this is iterative formula, next 
guess is old guess minus this fraction 
function evaluate old guess 
divided derivative evaluate 
old guess 
this works, marching 
closer to a function 
heres good function 
division 
this function a b 
so, if i get closer closer to a 
zero this function, im actually 
computing b, is i want 
to 
so, lets try to rewrite this formula 
using this 
first step here is to 
differentiate this 
so, lets differentiate this 
well, differential goes back to x 
so, derivative x is minus 
x squared, b here is 
constant 
so, i to include 
so, this is derivative f 
now, ill use that to try to make this 
newtons method formula look a little bit 
nicer 
so, x n plus is x n minus 
function evaluated, x n, is 
x n minus b, divided 
derivative evaluator x n, is 
minus x n squared 
now, to kill this denominator, lets 
multiple minus x sub n squared divided 
minus x sub n squared 
thats a sneaky version , 
manages to kill denominator 
simplify this a bit 
ive got x sub n 
ive got minus x sub n squared times 
x sub n, that leaves a minus 
x sub n 
ive got a negative b, negative x sub 
n squared, thats a plus b x sub n 
squared 
im subtracting this 
so, ive got x sub n plus x sub n, thats 
two x sub ns, minus b x n squared 
ill factor an x n, so x n 
times minus bx n 
ive got here is an iterative 
formula that, least works 
applying this iterative formula is going 
to move closer closer to one 
b 
this formula doesnt involve division, 
involves multiplying 
subtracting 
so, this is a way to approximate b 
without ever dividing, right 
multiplying subtracting 

then, well make this even concrete 
lets set b equals so i try to 
approximate 
so here we go 
b will 
so, trying to approximate th 
using newtons method 
so, i make an initial guess 
ill make initial guess th 
make arithmetic work out, a 
little bit reasonably 
im going to start this initial 
guess, ill use this formula we 
derived to improve this initial guess to a 
hopefully better guess 
so, i take original guess, th 
multiply minus b is , times 
previous guess th 
i calculate this 
this is th times, instead ill 
write th 
instead times a th, ill write 
th 
i got minus th, so thats th 
so, th times th, thats th 
thats a slightly better to 
value of, th, i repeat 
this process using this formula 
so, ill get a better guess here x sub 
starting previous guess, 
is th 
multiply that minus times 
previous guess th 
i calculate this is 
so, th 
instead , ill write th, thats 
another name minus 
instead times , ill multiply that 

ill get th 
now, minus , thats th times 
th 
times is , times 
is , 
so, thats an even better approximation to 
actual value th 
i could appreciate process 
arithmetic gets, you know, sort 
awful 
point here isnt so much, you 
know, that i actually this 
paper, that i would want to this 
paper 
that this procedure involves 
adding, subtracting, multiplying, 
yet ends calculating a division 
problem 
well, close we to actual value 
th 
th is keeps 
going 
so yeah, really quite well 
i mean, is a pretty good guess to 
actual value th 
this method a name 
so, this technique usually goes 
name newtonraphson division 
we saw that works finding 
recipricols, if you find 
recipricols you multiply, you 
division in general 
alright, if you wanted to approximate 
th using this technique, well, you 
point that th is times th, 
right 
imagine that you multiply, add, 
subtract, division is hard 
okay, well a moment ago, we approximated 
th, alright 
we approximated th to , 
, 
this second stage in 
approximation 
times , is , 
isnt so far th, right 
point though is that, you know, if 
division, if division that 
involves repeated adding, subtracting, 
multiplying
