i often want to find approximate roots 
well, heres set 
i start nice function, f, nice 
meaning differentiable 
maybe derivative is continuous, a, a 
reasonable function 
i want to find input, x, so 
that function evaluated that input 
is equal to 
in practice, this is way much to 
ask 
im really going to able to find 
particular input x 
i mean i might even able to write 
that input in reasonable sense 
i ask is i find 
x so that, f x is close to 
right i mean, maybe i cant find so 
that output function is equal 
to zero 
maybe i find an input so that 
output there is really close to , really 
small 
if you think back, weve already done 
this 
right 
if you remember this video, i use 
intermediate value theorem, i able 
to proximate a root a function 
interrogating function, evaluating 
a handful points 
and, there that bisection trick 
so in this example looks like 
function evaluated that a is positive 
function evaluated b is negative 
this function looks like a reasonable nice 
function whos continuous so 
intermediate value theorem applies 
that mean inbetween a b, theres 
input, functions output is 
i cut this interval in half if i 
look in middle interval 
functions output there is positive, 
that means in between two 
inputs there must input 
functions output is 
i could cut that in half 
if i look input there, 
output function is negative 
that means in between two inputs 
there must input so functions 
output is 
i could cut that in half 
if i look there functions output 
is positive 
so ive got a negative output put in a 
positive output, so in between, 
intermediate value theorem, there must 
input functions output is 
so so forth, right 
im getting closer closer to point 
function output is actually 
equal to , least i approximate 
this way 
downside to this bisection method is 
speed, takes a really long time 
so a different method, called newtons 
method, is much faster this bisection 
trick 
well, this is faster actually 
works 
so is newtons method 
im trying to is find x 
coordinate, graph this 
function crosses xaxis right 
i want to know an input so this functions 
output there is 
instead marching in either 
side, in intermediate value theorem, 
newtons method us start 
making a potentially bad guess 
heres st guess 
im going to call x 
yeah, thats, thats a good 
guess 
functions output is 
way here 
that close to 
ive made that first guess, 
newton tells us to draw tangent line 
to curve 
through, that point 
so heres tangent line to curve 
that point 
next guess will wherever 
that tangent line crosses x axis 
so here would next guess x 
i hope that, that next guess 
is better 
i could repeat process 
right 
i could game here 
this point is closer to 
i could draw another 
tangent line to curve, that 
point 
this next place that 
tangent line crosses x axis thatll 
x , next guess 
least this picture looks 
like thats an even better guess to 
graph this function crosses 
x axis 
so least pictorily thats newtons 
method is telling us to 
lets write steps 
well here is newtons method in words 
you start initial guess x 
next step is to draw tangent line 
point x f x, right 
thats exactly i here 
i started x i drew this st 
red tangent line 
next step is to figure 
that tangent line 
right, tangent line right there 
crosses xaxis 
im going to use that new 
guess, x 
i hope will a better guess 
original guess 
right, original guess pretty 
far away 
x, is tangent line here 
crosses xaxis 
im hoping thats a better guess 
yeah, least in this example is 
im going to repeat process 
right 
in this picture, i new guess x 
i drew tangent line to 
graph x comma f x that 
tangent line intesect x access a 
point im calling x im 
hoping that, thats even a better 
guess to actual point 
graph crosses x access 
right, so thats this repeat process 
you keep repeating this 
long you want 
and, you know, hopefully youre getting 
better better guesses every time 
to exactly that graph crosses 
xaxis 
worked this equations 
right 
im going to write equation in 
tangent line 
solve wherever that tangent 
line crosses xaxis 
so im going to start thinking 
this red line, right 
this red line is tangent line to 
orange graph point x, f x 
a tangent line, so slope 
derivative x 
here ive written point slope 
form red line 
right 
y minus y coordinate line, 
is fx, is equal to slope 
line is derivative add x 
times x minus x coordinate 
line, is x 
now, newtons method tells that i 
use that linear approximation to 
graph, figure linear 
approximation crosses x axis 
hope thats a better approximation to 
orange curve actually crosses 
x axis 
so to that, im going to set y equals 
im going to solve x 
right 
thatll tell red line 
crosses x axis, if i solve this 
equation x 
well, i expand out, this side 
right 
and, righthand side this equation 
is f prime, x times x minus f prime x 
times x 
im going to add f prime x times x to 
sides 
so equation becomes f prime x times 
x minus f x is equal to f prime x 
times x, right 
i added f prime x times x to 
sides 
here went away 
right 
so f prime x times x minus f x is 
equal to this f prime x times x 
assuming that derivative equal 
to this point im going to divide 
sides f prime x 
going to divide this side f prime 
f , i get x 
minus f x divided f prime x, so 
thats this lefthand side divided f 
prime x 
f prime x here cancelled, f 
x divided f prime x is i got 
here 
im dividing sides f prime 
x, so this side is x 
so x coordinate this red line 
crosses x axis is this 
im going to call this new 
hopefully improved guess, x sub 
this equation in hand, i 
write step step process 
newtons method using a formula 
heres step step process 
i start initial guess x sub , 
im drawing that tangent line to 
graph x x f , looking that 
tangent line crosses x axis to get 
new guess, right 
this is formula we computed 
x, new guess, is x minus 
functions value there divided 
functions derived there 
that new guess, i play 
game 
drawing tangent line to graph 
x, f x 
figure that tangent line crosses 
xaxis, to get a newer guess x 
formula works that 
old guess minus function 
old guess divided derivative 
old guess, to get new guess 
i keep playing this game 

hoping that generation brings 
closer to a place functions 
value is in fact 
lets summarize formula 
so in summering i could say that new 
guess ill call x n plus , is 
old guess minus functions value 
old guess divided functions 
derivative old guess 
i keep repeating this 

this works, right, newtons 
method actually succeeds, works really 
well zooms in that root really 
quickly 
problem is that i cant promise you 
that newtons method will actually work
