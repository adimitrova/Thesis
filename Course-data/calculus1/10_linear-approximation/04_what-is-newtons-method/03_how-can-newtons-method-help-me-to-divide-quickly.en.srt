1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,808
[music] You've already seen a few
different techniques for how to multiply

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:09,186
quickly.
Some of those techniques include

3
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:13,177
quartersquares, using logarithms or a
sliderule.

4
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:18,309
And that method of prosthaphaeresis, which
involves arc cosine.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,742
So yeah, there's a ton of different
techniques that I can use to multiply two

6
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:25,857
numbers quickly.
But what if I could already multiply

7
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:30,531
quickly, but I wanted to divide quickly?
What if I wanted to calculate 1 divided by

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,234
b?
Well, we can use Newton's method to do

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,968
this.
Now, how we're going to use Newton's

10
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:39,121
method.
Well, Newton's method is really a trick

11
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:43,977
for finding zeroes of a function.
So, if I want to approximate one divided

12
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:49,177
by b, the reciprocal of b, what I really
want to find is some function where that

13
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:54,258
number is a zero of the function.
Newton's method will help me approximate

14
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:58,172
that zero and consequently help me
approximate 1 over b.

15
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:03,341
There's a ton of different choices that
are possible for such a function.

16
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:07,846
Well, here's one choice.
The function f of x equals 1 over x minus

17
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:10,928
b.
And let's just check, yeah, if I evaluate

18
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:14,819
this function at 1 over b, that's 1 over 1
over b minus b.

19
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,777
But 1 over 1 over b, the reciprocal of the
reciprocal of b, is just b.

20
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:25,695
And b minus b is in fact 0.
So, this function f does have 1 over b as

21
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:29,084
a 0.
Now let's apply Newton's method.

22
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:32,932
So how are we going to do this?
Here is the formula for Newtons' method,

23
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,513
right?
This is the iterative formula, my next

24
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:39,927
guess is my old guess minus this fraction.
The function evaluate of my old guess

25
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:42,814
divided by the derivative evaluate of my
old guess.

26
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:46,483
And when this works, it's marching me
closer to a 0 of the function.

27
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:49,209
And here's the good function for doing
division.

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,582
This function has a 0 at 1 over b.
So, if I can get closer and closer to a

29
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:58,418
zero of this function, I'm actually
computing 1 over b, which is what I want

30
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,442
to do.
So, let's try to rewrite this formula just

31
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:04,097
by using this.
And the first step here is to

32
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:07,378
differentiate this.
So, let's differentiate this.

33
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,408
Well, the differential goes back to x.
So, the derivative of 1 over x is minus 1

34
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,758
over x squared, and the b here is the
constant.

35
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,509
So, I have to include it.
So, this is the derivative of f.

36
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,350
Now, I'll use that to try to make this
Newton's method formula look a little bit

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,652
nicer.
So, x of n plus 1 is x of n minus the

38
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:30,032
function evaluated, x of n, which is 1
over x of n minus b, divided by the

39
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:35,926
derivative evaluator x of n, which is
minus 1 over x of n squared.

40
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:41,372
Now, to kill off this denominator, let's
multiple by minus x sub n squared divided

41
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:45,738
by minus x sub n squared.
That's just a sneaky version of 1, but it

42
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:49,926
manages to kill off the denominator
simplify this a bit.

43
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:53,907
I've got x sub n.
I've got minus x sub n squared times 1

44
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,584
over x sub n, that leaves me with a minus
x sub n.

45
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:04,021
And I've got a negative b, negative x sub
n squared, that's a plus b x sub n

46
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,920
squared.
I'm subtracting this.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,226
So, I've got x sub n plus x sub n, that's
two x sub n's, minus b x of n squared.

48
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:18,556
And I'll factor out an x of n, so x of n
times 2 minus bx of n.

49
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:25,888
And what I've got here now is an iterative
formula that, at least when it works.

50
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,044
Applying this iterative formula is going
to move me closer and closer to one over

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,051
b.
But this formula doesn't involve division,

52
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:37,087
it only involves multiplying and
subtracting.

53
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:41,772
So, this is a way to approximate 1 over b
without ever dividing, right?

54
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,339
Just multiplying and subtracting over and
over again.

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,866
Then, we'll make this even more concrete.
Let's set b equals 7 so I can try to

56
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:53,779
approximate 1 over 7.
So here we go.

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,823
B will be 7.
So, we're trying to approximate 1 7th

58
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:01,561
using Newton's method.
So, I make an initial guess.

59
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:07,092
And I'll make my initial guess 1 10th and
make some of the arithmetic work out, a

60
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:11,573
little bit more reasonably.
And I'm going to start with this initial

61
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:16,469
guess, and I'll use this formula we just
derived to improve this initial guess to a

62
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:20,526
hopefully better guess.
So, I take my original guess, 1 10th.

63
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:25,606
Multiply it by 2 minus b is 7, times my
previous guess of 1 10th.

64
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:31,192
I can calculate this.
This is 1 10th times, instead of 2 I'll

65
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:36,392
write 20 10th.
And instead of 7 times a 10th, I'll write

66
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:40,986
7 10th.
I got 20 minus 7 10th, so that's 13 10th.

67
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:47,392
So, 1 10th times 13 10th, that's 13 100th
and that's a slightly better as to the

68
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:53,737
value of, of 1 7th, but I can now repeat
this process using this formula again.

69
00:04:53,737 --> 00:05:00,541
So, I'll get a better guess here x sub 2
by starting with my previous guess, which

70
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,679
is 13 100th.
Multiply that by 2 minus 7 times my

71
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:09,666
previous guess of 13 100th.
I can calculate what this is.

72
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:14,997
So, 13 100th.
Instead of 2, I'll write 200 100th, that's

73
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:20,716
another name for 2 minus.
Instead of 7 times 13, I'll multiply that

74
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:24,288
out.
I'll get 91 100th.

75
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:32,156
Now, 200 minus 91, that's 109 100th times
13 100th.

76
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:40,854
And 13 times 109 is 1417, and 100 times
100 is 10,000.

77
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:45,339
So, that's an even better approximation to
the actual value of 1 7th.

78
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:50,410
And I could appreciate the process again.
The arithmetic gets, you know, sort of

79
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,136
awful.
But the point here isn't so much, you

80
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:57,936
know, that I can actually do this on
paper, or that I would want to do this on

81
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,898
paper.
But that this procedure only involves

82
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:06,202
adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and
yet it ends up calculating a division

83
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:10,020
problem.
Well, how close are we to the actual value

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,865
of 1 7th?
1 7th is about 0.142857 and it keeps on

85
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:17,583
going.
So yeah, we're doing really quite well.

86
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:22,609
I mean, 0.14 is a pretty good guess as to
the actual value of 1 7th.

87
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:26,830
This method has a name.
So, this technique usually goes by the

88
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,730
name Newton-Raphson Division.
And we just saw that it works for finding

89
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,512
recipricols, but if you can find
recipricols and you can multiply, you can

90
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,813
do division in general.
Alright, if you wanted to approximate 3

91
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:41,719
7th using this technique, well, you just
point out that 3 7th is 3 times 1 7th,

92
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,170
right?
And imagine that you can multiply, add,

93
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,862
subtract, but the division is hard.
Okay, well a moment ago, we approximated 1

94
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:55,120
7th, alright?
We approximated 1 7th to be about 1,417

95
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,797
over 10,000.
This was the second stage in the

96
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:06,308
approximation.
And 3 times 1,417 is 4251 over 10,000.

97
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:14,584
Which isn't so far off of 3 7th, right?
The point though is that, you know, if

98
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:23,084
division, but if division that only
involves repeated adding, subtracting, and

99
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:24,618
multiplying.
