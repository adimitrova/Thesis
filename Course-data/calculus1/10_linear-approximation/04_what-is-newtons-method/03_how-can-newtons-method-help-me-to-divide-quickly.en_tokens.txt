you
've
already
seen
a
few
different
techniques
for
how
to
multiply
quickly
.
some
of
those
techniques
include
quartersquares
,
using
logarithms
or
a
sliderule
.
and
that
method
of
prosthaphaeresis
,
which
involves
arc
cosine
.
so
yeah
,
there
's
a
ton
of
different
techniques
that
i
can
use
to
multiply
two
numbers
quickly
.
but
what
if
i
could
already
multiply
quickly
,
but
i
wanted
to
divide
quickly
?
what
if
i
wanted
to
calculate
1
divided
by
b
?
well
,
we
can
use
newton
's
method
to
do
this
.
now
,
how
we
're
going
to
use
newton
's
method
.
well
,
newton
's
method
is
really
a
trick
for
finding
zeroes
of
a
function
.
so
,
if
i
want
to
approximate
one
divided
by
b
,
the
reciprocal
of
b
,
what
i
really
want
to
find
is
some
function
where
that
number
is
a
zero
of
the
function
.
newton
's
method
will
help
me
approximate
that
zero
and
consequently
help
me
approximate
1
over
b.
there
's
a
ton
of
different
choices
that
are
possible
for
such
a
function
.
well
,
here
's
one
choice
.
the
function
f
of
x
equals
1
over
x
minus
b.
and
let
's
just
check
,
yeah
,
if
i
evaluate
this
function
at
1
over
b
,
that
's
1
over
1
over
b
minus
b.
but
1
over
1
over
b
,
the
reciprocal
of
the
reciprocal
of
b
,
is
just
b.
and
b
minus
b
is
in
fact
0.
so
,
this
function
f
does
have
1
over
b
as
a
0.
now
let
's
apply
newton
's
method
.
so
how
are
we
going
to
do
this
?
here
is
the
formula
for
newtons
'
method
,
right
?
this
is
the
iterative
formula
,
my
next
guess
is
my
old
guess
minus
this
fraction
.
the
function
evaluate
of
my
old
guess
divided
by
the
derivative
evaluate
of
my
old
guess
.
and
when
this
works
,
it
's
marching
me
closer
to
a
0
of
the
function
.
and
here
's
the
good
function
for
doing
division
.
this
function
has
a
0
at
1
over
b.
so
,
if
i
can
get
closer
and
closer
to
a
zero
of
this
function
,
i
'm
actually
computing
1
over
b
,
which
is
what
i
want
to
do
.
so
,
let
's
try
to
rewrite
this
formula
just
by
using
this
.
and
the
first
step
here
is
to
differentiate
this
.
so
,
let
's
differentiate
this
.
well
,
the
differential
goes
back
to
x.
so
,
the
derivative
of
1
over
x
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
,
and
the
b
here
is
the
constant
.
so
,
i
have
to
include
it
.
so
,
this
is
the
derivative
of
f.
now
,
i
'll
use
that
to
try
to
make
this
newton
's
method
formula
look
a
little
bit
nicer
.
so
,
x
of
n
plus
1
is
x
of
n
minus
the
function
evaluated
,
x
of
n
,
which
is
1
over
x
of
n
minus
b
,
divided
by
the
derivative
evaluator
x
of
n
,
which
is
minus
1
over
x
of
n
squared
.
now
,
to
kill
off
this
denominator
,
let
's
multiple
by
minus
x
sub
n
squared
divided
by
minus
x
sub
n
squared
.
that
's
just
a
sneaky
version
of
1
,
but
it
manages
to
kill
off
the
denominator
simplify
this
a
bit
.
i
've
got
x
sub
n.
i
've
got
minus
x
sub
n
squared
times
1
over
x
sub
n
,
that
leaves
me
with
a
minus
x
sub
n.
and
i
've
got
a
negative
b
,
negative
x
sub
n
squared
,
that
's
a
plus
b
x
sub
n
squared
.
i
'm
subtracting
this
.
so
,
i
've
got
x
sub
n
plus
x
sub
n
,
that
's
two
x
sub
n
's
,
minus
b
x
of
n
squared
.
and
i
'll
factor
out
an
x
of
n
,
so
x
of
n
times
2
minus
bx
of
n.
and
what
i
've
got
here
now
is
an
iterative
formula
that
,
at
least
when
it
works
.
applying
this
iterative
formula
is
going
to
move
me
closer
and
closer
to
one
over
b.
but
this
formula
does
n't
involve
division
,
it
only
involves
multiplying
and
subtracting
.
so
,
this
is
a
way
to
approximate
1
over
b
without
ever
dividing
,
right
?
just
multiplying
and
subtracting
over
and
over
again
.
then
,
we
'll
make
this
even
more
concrete
.
let
's
set
b
equals
7
so
i
can
try
to
approximate
1
over
7.
so
here
we
go
.
b
will
be
7.
so
,
we
're
trying
to
approximate
1
7th
using
newton
's
method
.
so
,
i
make
an
initial
guess
.
and
i
'll
make
my
initial
guess
1
10th
and
make
some
of
the
arithmetic
work
out
,
a
little
bit
more
reasonably
.
and
i
'm
going
to
start
with
this
initial
guess
,
and
i
'll
use
this
formula
we
just
derived
to
improve
this
initial
guess
to
a
hopefully
better
guess
.
so
,
i
take
my
original
guess
,
1
10th
.
multiply
it
by
2
minus
b
is
7
,
times
my
previous
guess
of
1
10th
.
i
can
calculate
this
.
this
is
1
10th
times
,
instead
of
2
i
'll
write
20
10th
.
and
instead
of
7
times
a
10th
,
i
'll
write
7
10th
.
i
got
20
minus
7
10th
,
so
that
's
13
10th
.
so
,
1
10th
times
13
10th
,
that
's
13
100th
and
that
's
a
slightly
better
as
to
the
value
of
,
of
1
7th
,
but
i
can
now
repeat
this
process
using
this
formula
again
.
so
,
i
'll
get
a
better
guess
here
x
sub
2
by
starting
with
my
previous
guess
,
which
is
13
100th
.
multiply
that
by
2
minus
7
times
my
previous
guess
of
13
100th
.
i
can
calculate
what
this
is
.
so
,
13
100th
.
instead
of
2
,
i
'll
write
200
100th
,
that
's
another
name
for
2
minus
.
instead
of
7
times
13
,
i
'll
multiply
that
out
.
i
'll
get
91
100th
.
now
,
200
minus
91
,
that
's
109
100th
times
13
100th
.
and
13
times
109
is
1417
,
and
100
times
100
is
10,000.
so
,
that
's
an
even
better
approximation
to
the
actual
value
of
1
7th
.
and
i
could
appreciate
the
process
again
.
the
arithmetic
gets
,
you
know
,
sort
of
awful
.
but
the
point
here
is
n't
so
much
,
you
know
,
that
i
can
actually
do
this
on
paper
,
or
that
i
would
want
to
do
this
on
paper
.
but
that
this
procedure
only
involves
adding
,
subtracting
,
and
multiplying
,
and
yet
it
ends
up
calculating
a
division
problem
.
well
,
how
close
are
we
to
the
actual
value
of
1
7th
?
1
7th
is
about
0.142857
and
it
keeps
on
going
.
so
yeah
,
we
're
doing
really
quite
well
.
i
mean
,
0.14
is
a
pretty
good
guess
as
to
the
actual
value
of
1
7th
.
this
method
has
a
name
.
so
,
this
technique
usually
goes
by
the
name
newton-raphson
division
.
and
we
just
saw
that
it
works
for
finding
recipricols
,
but
if
you
can
find
recipricols
and
you
can
multiply
,
you
can
do
division
in
general
.
alright
,
if
you
wanted
to
approximate
3
7th
using
this
technique
,
well
,
you
just
point
out
that
3
7th
is
3
times
1
7th
,
right
?
and
imagine
that
you
can
multiply
,
add
,
subtract
,
but
the
division
is
hard
.
okay
,
well
a
moment
ago
,
we
approximated
1
7th
,
alright
?
we
approximated
1
7th
to
be
about
1,417
over
10,000.
this
was
the
second
stage
in
the
approximation
.
and
3
times
1,417
is
4251
over
10,000.
which
is
n't
so
far
off
of
3
7th
,
right
?
the
point
though
is
that
,
you
know
,
if
division
,
but
if
division
that
only
involves
repeated
adding
,
subtracting
,
and
multiplying
.
