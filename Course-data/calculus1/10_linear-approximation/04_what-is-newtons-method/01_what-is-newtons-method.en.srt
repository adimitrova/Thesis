1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,823
[music].
I often want to find approximate roots.

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:08,780
Well, here's the set up.
I start with some nice function, f, nice

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,982
meaning differentiable.
Maybe the derivative is continuous, a, a

4
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:18,679
reasonable function.
And then I want to find some input, x, so

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,044
that the function evaluated at that input
is equal to 0.

6
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:26,501
Now in practice, this is way too much to
ask for.

7
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:30,826
I'm not really going to be able to find
some particular input x.

8
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:36,766
I mean I might not even be able to write
down that input in any reasonable sense.

9
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:43,417
But what I can ask for is I can find some
x so that, f of x is very close to 0.

10
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:49,093
Right I mean, maybe I can't find it so
that the output of the function is equal

11
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,739
to zero.
But maybe I can find an input so that the

12
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,555
output there is really close to 0, really
small.

13
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:59,605
If you think back, we've already done
this.

14
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,139
Right.
If you remember this video, where I use

15
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:06,693
the Intermediate Value Theorem, I was able
to proximate a root of a function just by

16
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,551
interrogating the function, evaluating it
at a handful of points.

17
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:14,207
And, there was that bisection trick.
So in this example it looks like the

18
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:18,793
function evaluated that a is positive and
the function evaluated b is negative.

19
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:23,023
This function looks like a reasonable nice
function who's continuous so the

20
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:27,828
intermediate value theorem applies.
And that mean in-between a and b, there's

21
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:30,819
some input, where the function's output is
0.

22
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,427
I can cut this interval in half and if I
look in the middle of interval the

23
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:40,497
function's output there is positive, and
that means just in between these two

24
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:44,778
inputs there must be some input where the
function's output is 0.

25
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:49,088
And then I could cut that in half again.
And if I look at the input there, the

26
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:53,685
output of the function is negative.
And that means in between these two inputs

27
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:56,860
there must be some input so the functions
output is 0.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,376
And then I could cut that in half again.
And if I look there the functions output

29
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:04,309
is positive.
So I've got a negative output Put in a

30
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:09,137
positive output, so in between, by the
intermediate value theorem, there must be

31
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,791
some input where the function's output is
0.

32
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,067
And so on and so forth, right?
I'm getting closer and closer to the point

33
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:20,682
where the function output is actually
equal to 0, at least I can approximate it

34
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,216
this way.
The downside to this bisection method is

35
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:29,882
just speed, it takes a really long time.
So a different method, called Newton's

36
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:33,496
method, is much faster than this bisection
trick.

37
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:36,706
Well, this is faster when it actually
works.

38
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:40,719
So what is Newton's method.
What I'm trying to do is find the x

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,001
coordinate, where the graph of this
function crosses the x-axis right.

40
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,446
I want to know an input so this function's
output there is 0.

41
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:53,336
And instead of marching in from either
side, as in intermediate value theorem,

42
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:57,567
Newton's method has us just start by
making a potentially bad guess.

43
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,704
Here's my 1st guess.
I'm going to call it x of 0.

44
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:03,890
And yeah, that's, that's not a very good
guess.

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,125
Because the function's output is all the
way up here.

46
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,945
Not that close to 0.
But after I've made that first guess,

47
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:14,685
Newton tells us to draw the tangent line
to the curve.

48
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:20,282
Through, through that point.
So here's the tangent line to the curve

49
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:24,975
through that point.
And then my next guess will be wherever

50
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:30,792
that tangent line crosses the x axis.
So here would be my next guess x of 1.

51
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,985
And then I just hope that, that next guess
is better.

52
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:38,444
But I could repeat the process.
Right?

53
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:43,763
I could do the same game here.
This point is closer to 0.

54
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:50,279
And then I could again draw another
tangent line to the curve, through that

55
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,612
point.
And then this next place where that

56
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:58,375
tangent line crosses the x axis that'll be
x of 2, my next guess.

57
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:04,051
And at least from this picture it looks
like that's an even better guess as to

58
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,954
where the graph of this function crosses
the x axis.

59
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:13,636
So at least pictorily that's what Newton's
method is telling us what to do.

60
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:18,486
Let's write down the steps.
Well here is Newton's method in words.

61
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:24,043
You start with some initial guess x0.
The next step is to draw the tangent line

62
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:28,856
through the point x0 f of x0, right.
That's exactly what I did here.

63
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:33,115
I started with x0 and then I drew this 1st
red Tangent line.

64
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,896
Now the next step is to figure out where
that tangent line.

65
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:40,893
All right, the tangent line right there.
Crosses the x-axis.

66
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:43,907
Now I'm going to use that for my new
guess, x of 1.

67
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:47,688
Which I hope will be a better guess from
my original guess.

68
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,325
All right, my original guess was pretty
far away from 0.

69
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:55,250
X1, Which is where the tangent line here
crosses the x-axis.

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,114
I'm hoping that's a better guess.
And yeah, at least in this example it is.

71
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:03,540
And then I'm going to repeat the process.
Right?

72
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,306
In this picture, once I had my new guess X
of 1 I then drew the tangent line to the

73
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:14,526
graph at X 1 comma F of X 1 and that
tangent line intesect the X access at a

74
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:20,016
point I'm calling X of 2 and I'm just
hoping then that, that's even a better

75
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:25,106
guess as to the actual point where the
graph crosses the X access.

76
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:29,518
All right, so that's this repeat process.
And you can just keep repeating this as

77
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,653
long as you want.
And, you know, hopefully you're getting

78
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:36,986
better and better guesses every time.
As to exactly where that graph crosses the

79
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,733
x-axis.
Those worked this all out with equations.

80
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,223
Right?
I'm going to write down the equation in

81
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,392
the tangent line.
And then solve for wherever that tangent

82
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:49,342
line crosses the x-axis.
So I'm going to start by thinking about

83
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:53,899
this red line, right?
This red line is the tangent line to the

84
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:59,715
orange graph at the point x0, f of x0.
And as a tangent line, so it has slope the

85
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:04,238
derivative at x0.
And here I've written down the point slope

86
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,327
form Of the red line.
Right?

87
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:12,430
It's y minus the y coordinate on the line,
which is fx0, is equal to the slope of the

88
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,961
line which is the derivative add x 0.
Times x minus the x coordinate on the

89
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,592
line, which is x0.
Now, Newton's method tells me that I

90
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:26,344
should use that linear approximation to
the graph, figure out where the linear

91
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:31,168
approximation crosses the x axis and just
hope that's a better approximation to

92
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,351
where the orange curve actually crosses
the x axis.

93
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:40,076
So to do that, I'm going to set y equals 0
and I'm going to solve for x.

94
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,864
Right.
And that'll tell me where the red line

95
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:48,123
crosses the x axis, if I solve this
equation for x.

96
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:51,977
Well, I can expand out, this side.
Right?

97
00:06:51,977 --> 00:07:00,303
And, the right-hand side of this equation
is f prime, x 0 times x minus f prime x0

98
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:05,312
times x0.
I'm going to add f prime x0 times x0 to

99
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:11,057
both sides.
So the equation becomes f prime x0 times

100
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:16,681
x0 minus f of x 0 is equal to f prime x 0
times x, right?

101
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:21,697
I just added f prime of x 0 times x 0 to
both sides.

102
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:24,634
And 0 here went away.
Right?

103
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:31,260
So f prime x 0 times x 0 minus f of x 0 is
equal to this f prime x 0 times x.

104
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,338
Now assuming that the derivative not equal
to 0 at this point I'm going to divide

105
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:42,270
both sides by f prime x 0.
We're going to divide this side by f prime

106
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,001
f 0, I just get x0.
0 minus f of x0 divided by f prime x0, so

107
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:51,748
that's this left-hand side divided by f
prime of x0.

108
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:58,495
The f prime x0 here cancelled, and the f
x0 divided by f prime of x0 is what I got

109
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:02,403
here.
And I'm dividing both sides by f prime of

110
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:08,038
x0, so this side is just x.
So the x coordinate where this red line

111
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,767
crosses the x axis is this.
And I'm going to call this my new

112
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:18,694
hopefully improved guess, x sub 1.
With this equation in hand, I can now

113
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:25,005
write down the step by step process for
Newtons method just using a formula.

114
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,523
Here's the step by step process.
I start with some initial guess x sub 0,

115
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:34,473
and then I'm drawing that tangent line to
the graph x 0 x of f 0, looking where that

116
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:38,205
tangent line crosses the x axis to get my
new guess, right?

117
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:42,433
And this is the formula we just computed.
X1, my new guess, is X 0 minus the

118
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:46,135
functions value there divided by the
functions derived there.

119
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:49,257
And with that new guess, I can then play
the same game.

120
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:52,344
Drawing the tangent line to the graph at
X1, F of X1.

121
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:56,998
Figure out where that tangent line crosses
the x-axis, to get a newer guess x of 2.

122
00:08:56,998 --> 00:09:00,829
Same formula works for that.
It's the old guess minus the function at

123
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,118
the old guess divided by the derivative at
the old guess, to get my new guess.

124
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:08,310
And I can just keep playing this game over
and over again.

125
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,244
Hoping that each generation brings me
closer To a place where the function's

126
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,916
value is in fact 0.
Let's just summarize the formula.

127
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:22,277
So in summering I could say that my new
guess which I'll call x of n plus 1, is my

128
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:27,802
old guess minus the function's value of my
old guess divided by the function's

129
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:32,596
derivative at my old guess.
And I can just keep repeating this over

130
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:37,897
and over again.
When this works, all right, when Newton's

131
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:45,989
method actually succeeds, it works really
well and it zooms in on that root really

132
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:50,872
quickly.
The problem is that I can't promise you

133
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:55,100
that Newton's method will actually work.
