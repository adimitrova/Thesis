music fun id like to know a 
root polynomial x to th, plus 
x squared, minus 
so heres function i want to 
find a root, right 
i want to find input that makes this 
function equal to 
i know this function 
continuous i know that f , if 
i plug in 
plus minus 
so f zero is minus 
f is to th plus squared 
minus 
thats plus minus , thats 
so i know here is ive got a 
continuous function 
value is minus 
value is 
so there to input between 
this functions output is 
equal to 
so i know theres a root there between 

lets find that root 
now, if we trying to find 
linear term equal to 
you solve x, in that case 
if i trying to figure 
quadratic equal to 
theres quadratic formula 
if i trying to figure ax 
cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d 
equal to 
i could use a complicated formula 
cubic formula 
way complicated 
quadratic formula 
there is a formula 
if i trying to solve an equation like 
this that started a x to th 
term, i could use quartic formula to 
that 
bad news is that here im trying to 
solve a quintic there is quintic 
formula in terms usual arithmetic 
operations plus, minus, times, 
divides, taking roots 
course quintics solved i 
mean, true 
right 
if i instead trying to find a 
solution to this equation, x to th 
minus equals , im looking 
value x, take th power 
subtract id get 
yes, i could solve this quintec 
right 
i mean, solution is th root 
in contrast this particular example x 
to th plus x squared minus cant 
solved in sense that i cant write 
using fractions, plus, minus, times, 
divides, taking roots 
a number which, if i take th power, 
add to square, subtract , i 
get back 
right 
i mean, thats sense in i cant 
solve 
i cant write that thing in 
terms operations that i 
hand 
knowing that requires something called 
galois theory 
so in light galois theory, 
even mean to find a, a root 
well, im going to able to write 
root 
i least approximate root 
using newtons method 
so i use newtons method to least 
approximate a root 
so heres function whose root i want 
to approximate 
right 
i want to find input so that f is 
close to 
ill first differentiate f 
so derivative f, well 
derivative x to th is x to 
th, derivative x squared is x, 
derivative is 
so ive got original function 
ive got derivative, newtons 
method tells that i make a first 
guess 
first guess will 
so ive made initial guess 
whats next guess 
so next guess according to newtons 
method 
well call that x , would old 
guess minus functions value old 
guess, divided functions 
derivative old guess 
old guess is 
functions value , thats to 
th plus squared minus 
thats plus minus , thats 
derivative , thats 
times to th plus times 
thats plus , thats 
so, new guess is minus 
thats ths, so thats new guess 
ths really isnt that bad a 
guess 
so original guess, right, x, that 
f 
next guess, x, that ths, right 
whats f ths 
well thats ths to th plus ths 
squared minus 
that turns to 
right 
so certainly this ths is a better guess 

armed better guess i apply 
newtons method hopefully arrive 
an even better approximation to 
rut 
so i get a new guess, x sub , taking 
old guess, x sub , subtracting 
functions value there, divided 
functions derivative there 
i that i get something 
is a 
x is an even better guess 
so i evaluate function f x , i get 
well turns to 
so this new guess root 
function is even better old guess, 
right 
old guess giving 
output this new guess is getting closer 
to a function looks like 
well dont stop 
ill 
i newtons method again, right 
ill get a newer guess even 
x will x minus f x 
divided derivative 
of, f x sub n 
this turns to 
this last guess is even better 
this is really working quite well 
f this new guess, x sub , turns to 

im getting much closer to 
actual this function 
sorts examples polynomials 
i cant explicitly write 
root 
really raise a fascinating question 
to even means to find root 
right, intermediate value theorem 
promises that there is a root 
in this case, between 
newtons method, this bisection 
algorithm permits to get better 
better approximations to that root 
in that sense that i 
ever find root 
in sense that i get close 
you want to that root
