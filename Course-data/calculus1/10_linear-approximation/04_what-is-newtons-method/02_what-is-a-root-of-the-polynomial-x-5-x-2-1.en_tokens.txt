just
for
fun
i
'd
like
to
know
a
root
of
the
polynomial
x
to
the
5th
,
plus
x
squared
,
minus
1.
so
here
's
the
function
where
i
want
to
find
a
root
,
right
?
i
want
to
find
some
input
that
makes
this
function
equal
to
0.
what
do
i
know
about
this
function
?
it
's
continuous
and
i
know
that
f
of
0
,
if
i
plug
in
0.
it
's
0
plus
0
minus
1.
so
f
of
zero
is
minus
1.
and
f
of
1
is
1
to
the
5th
plus
1
squared
minus
1.
that
's
1
plus
1
minus
1
,
that
's
1.
so
what
i
know
here
is
i
've
got
a
continuous
function
.
and
its
value
at
0
is
minus
1
and
its
value
at
1
is
1.
so
there
has
to
be
some
input
between
0
and
1
where
this
function
's
output
is
equal
to
0.
so
i
know
there
's
a
root
there
between
0
and
1.
let
's
find
that
root
.
now
,
if
we
were
just
trying
to
find
where
some
linear
term
was
equal
to
0.
you
can
just
solve
for
x
,
in
that
case
.
if
i
were
just
trying
to
figure
out
where
some
quadratic
was
equal
to
0.
there
's
the
quadratic
formula
.
if
i
were
trying
to
figure
out
where
ax
cubed
plus
bx
squared
plus
cx
plus
d
was
equal
to
0.
i
could
use
a
more
complicated
formula
.
it
's
the
cubic
formula
.
it
's
way
more
complicated
than
the
quadratic
formula
.
but
there
is
such
a
formula
.
if
i
were
trying
to
solve
an
equation
like
this
that
started
with
a
x
to
the
4th
term
,
i
could
use
the
quartic
formula
to
do
that
.
the
bad
news
is
that
here
i
'm
trying
to
solve
a
quintic
and
there
is
no
quintic
formula
in
terms
of
the
usual
arithmetic
operations
plus
,
minus
,
times
,
and
divides
,
and
taking
roots
.
of
course
some
quintics
can
be
solved
i
mean
,
it
's
true
.
right
?
if
i
had
instead
been
trying
to
find
a
solution
to
this
equation
,
x
to
the
5th
minus
2
equals
0
,
i
'm
looking
for
some
value
of
x
,
take
its
5th
power
and
subtract
2
and
i
'd
get
0.
yes
,
i
could
solve
this
quintec
.
right
?
i
mean
,
its
solution
is
the
5th
root
of
2.
but
in
contrast
this
particular
example
x
to
the
5th
plus
x
squared
minus
1
ca
n't
be
solved
in
the
sense
that
i
ca
n't
write
down
using
fractions
,
plus
,
minus
,
times
,
divides
,
and
the
taking
of
roots
.
a
number
which
,
if
i
take
it
's
5th
power
,
add
it
to
its
square
,
and
subtract
1
,
i
get
back
0.
right
?
i
mean
,
that
's
the
sense
in
which
i
ca
n't
solve
it
.
i
ca
n't
just
write
that
thing
down
in
terms
of
the
operations
that
i
have
at
hand
.
knowing
that
requires
something
called
the
galois
theory
.
so
in
light
of
galois
theory
,
what
does
it
even
mean
to
find
a
,
a
root
.
well
,
i
'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
write
down
the
root
.
but
i
can
at
least
approximate
the
root
by
using
newton
's
method
.
so
i
can
use
newton
's
method
to
at
least
approximate
a
root
.
so
here
's
the
function
whose
root
i
want
to
approximate
.
right
?
i
want
to
find
some
input
so
that
f
is
close
to
0.
and
i
'll
first
differentiate
f.
so
the
derivative
of
f
,
well
the
derivative
of
x
to
the
5th
is
5
x
to
the
4th
,
derivative
of
x
squared
is
2
x
,
and
the
derivative
of
1
is
0.
so
i
've
got
my
original
function
.
i
've
got
my
derivative
,
and
then
newton
's
method
tells
me
that
i
should
make
a
first
guess
.
my
first
guess
will
be
1.
so
i
've
made
my
initial
guess
.
what
's
my
next
guess
?
so
my
next
guess
according
to
newton
's
method
.
we
'll
call
that
x
of
1
,
would
be
my
old
guess
minus
the
functions
value
of
my
old
guess
,
divided
by
the
function
's
derivative
at
my
old
guess
.
and
now
my
old
guess
is
1.
the
function
's
value
at
1
,
that
's
1
to
the
5th
plus
1
squared
minus
1.
that
's
1
plus
1
minus
1
,
that
's
1.
and
the
derivative
at
1
,
now
that
's
5
times
1
to
the
4th
plus
2
times
1.
that
's
5
plus
2
,
that
's
7.
so
,
my
new
guess
is
1
minus
1
over
7.
that
's
6
7ths
,
so
that
's
my
new
guess
.
and
6
7ths
really
is
n't
that
bad
of
a
guess
.
so
my
original
guess
,
right
,
x0
,
that
was
and
f
of
1
was
just
1.
my
next
guess
,
x1
,
that
was
6
7ths
,
right
?
and
what
's
f
of
6
7ths
?
well
that
's
6
7ths
to
the
5th
plus
6
7ths
squared
minus
1.
that
turns
out
to
be
about
.197.
right
?
so
certainly
this
6
7ths
is
a
better
guess
than
1.
now
armed
with
my
better
guess
i
can
apply
newton
's
method
again
and
hopefully
arrive
at
an
even
better
approximation
to
the
rut
.
so
i
get
a
new
guess
,
x
sub
2
,
by
taking
my
old
guess
,
x
sub
1
,
and
subtracting
the
functions
value
there
,
divided
by
the
functions
derivative
there
.
and
when
i
do
that
i
get
something
which
is
a
about
.812.
x
of
2
is
an
even
better
guess
.
so
i
evaluate
my
function
f
at
x
2
,
i
get
well
it
turns
out
to
be
about
.014.
so
this
new
guess
for
the
root
of
my
function
is
even
better
then
my
old
guess
,
right
?
my
old
guess
was
giving
me
.197
as
the
output
this
new
guess
is
getting
me
closer
to
a
0
of
the
function
looks
like
.
well
do
n't
stop
.
i
'll
do
it
again
.
i
can
do
newton
's
method
again
,
right
.
and
i
'll
get
a
newer
guess
even
.
x
of
3
will
be
x
of
2
minus
f
of
x
of
2
divided
by
the
derivative
.
of
,
of
f
at
x
sub
2
n.
this
turns
out
to
be
about
.809.
this
last
guess
is
even
better
.
and
this
is
really
working
quite
well
.
f
at
this
new
guess
,
x
sub
3
,
turns
out
to
be
about
0.000085.
and
i
'm
getting
much
closer
now
to
the
actual
0
of
this
function
.
these
sorts
of
examples
of
polynomials
where
i
ca
n't
explicitly
write
down
the
root
.
they
really
raise
a
fascinating
question
as
to
what
it
even
means
to
find
the
root
.
all
right
,
the
intermediate
value
theorem
promises
me
that
there
is
a
root
.
in
this
case
,
between
0
and
1.
and
newton
's
method
,
or
this
bi-section
algorithm
permits
me
to
get
better
and
better
approximations
to
that
root
.
but
it
's
only
in
that
sense
that
i
can
ever
find
the
root
.
it
's
in
the
sense
that
i
can
get
as
close
as
you
want
to
that
root
.
