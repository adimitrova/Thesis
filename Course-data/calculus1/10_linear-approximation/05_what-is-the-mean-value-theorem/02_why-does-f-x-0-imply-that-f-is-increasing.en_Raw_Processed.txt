mean value theorem 
applications connects derivative 
information back to information 
original function 
well, heres a theorem 
suppose derivative function 
so im assuming a differential 
function, is positive, greater 
zero open interval 
function is an increasing 
function, meaning that sends, bigger 
inputs to bigger outputs 
you probably already believe that 
statement 
mean value theorem lets us verify 
that actually true 
okay, so lets prove, this result 
im going to pick, two points a b, 
i want to make sure that i pick in 
order 
so im going to pick b bigger a so i 
talk interval a b 
right 
so ill pick two points 
im going to apply mean value 
theorem to open interval a,b 
thats ok im going to pick a 
b to in this open interval 
thats mean that f differentiable 
satisfies conditions mean value 
theorem 
continuous closed interval a, b 
will differnetial open 
interval a, b 
okay 
so mean value theorem tells to 
look f v minus f a b minus 
a, conclusion is that this is 
derivative f mystery point in 
between a b 
good news is i dont know much 
derivative i know 
derivative is positive 
so i know that f b minus f a b 
minus a is positive 
thing that i know is that b is 
greater a that means 
denominator here b minus a is also 
positive 
so ive got mystery number divided 
positive is positive 
that means this numerator must also 
positive 
so f b minus f a is positive 
now, if i add f a to sides, i get 
that f b is bigger f a 
if f sends bigger inputs to bigger outputs 
f is increasing 
increasing means that a bigger input is 
sent to a bigger output 
so if b is greater a f b is 
bigger f a this argument works 
a b in open interval 
i know derivative is positive 
so im going to conclude that f is an 
increasing function, is exactly 
i wanted to show 
so if derivatives positive a whole 
interval, functions increasing 
that interval 
important to point that i 
needed to know sign, i g n 
derivative that entire interval 
mean value theorem ends 
picking a single point, that point c, 
itll examine derivative 
in order to cover bases right 
i dont know point c mean 
value theorem might make look 
ive got to control sign i g n 
derivative entire interval 
alright, i play game 
sign derivative is negative 
so, if i know sign sig derivative 
is negative open interval i 
include that f is a decreasing function 
and, this is an application 
mean value theorem 
lets see proof 
so, im going to start 
picking two points a,b in opening 
interval ill pick so that 
b is greater a so i talk 
interval a,b 
applying mean value theorem, 
i look at, f b minus, f a 
b minus a 
mean value theorem promises 
that this is derivative point, 
i dont know c is 
derivative point 
i know that derivative 
point is negative so this must 
negative 
b minus a is positive bs 
bigger a 
so ive got a number i dont know divided 
a positive number is negative 
that means that f b minus f a must 
negative 
i add f a to sides i 
conclude that f b is less f a 
in words, f sends bigger inputs to 
smaller output 
since f sends bigger inputs to smaller 
outputs, f is a decreasing function 
seeing that mean 
value theorem lets relate information 
derivative, in this case 
fact that sign derivative is 
negative 
back to information original 
function, in this case functions 
decreasing 
alright, well lets summarize weve 
learned thus far 
so here applications mean 
value theorem 
if f is differentiable open 
interval depending to happens 
we know something f that 
interval 
so if derivative is identically zero, 
if derivative is equal to zero 
matter i plug in, f is constant 
that interval 
if derivative is positive matter 
i plug in, f is increasing 
that interval 
and, if derivative is negative, f 
is decreasing that interval
