a classic problem mean theorem 
problem thats often asked in calculus 
courses, well, that classic problem goes 
like this 
given a function f points a b, i 
want to find point c, so that f 
prime c is equal to f b minus f a 
b minus a 
mean value theorem promises us that 
long f is a nice enough function, nice 
enough meaning differentiable 
open interval a b, continuous 
closed interval a b 
that long f is a nice enough 
function, thats possible 
i find that point c, so that 
derivative f point c is equal to 
f b minus f a b minus a 
let, lets an example i try to 
find that point c 
so lets an example 
ill f x, making 
example, thatll x cubed will 
interval a equal b 
equals 
so really, im trying to is find 
point c so that derivative 
function point c is f b minus f 
a b minus a 
now, in this case, f b is cubed, 
thats 
f a is cubed, thats 
b minus a, thats minus 
this is 
thats 
so im looking a point c, 
derivative is equal to 
now, i that 
yeah 
i gotta differentiate this function 
so here we go 
ill differentiate this function, i 
get that derivative x cube is x 
squared, im looking value 
x is that equal to 
well divide sides 
im looking a value x, x 
squared is 
so divide sides 
x between a b, right 
so in that case, x is positive square 
root 
ive really accomplished here, if 
i make a little graph, heres x y 
plane, ill draw kind a made 
graph cubed function 
right, heres point , say 
heres point 
here is , 
heres , 
right 
slope line here, right, is 
right, slope here is 
ive really managed to here is 
find that square root , 
slope tangent line is exactly 
slope line , 
, , cubed 
super important to emphasize that 
although kinds problems fun, 
mean value theorem guarantees that 
nice enough functions we find 
a c, yeah, fun problems 
mean value theorem guarantees that 
possible 
thats point mean value 
theorem 
mean value theorem is a 
computational result 
really an existence theorem 
important to emphasize power 
existence results 
something like mean value theorem 
tells you that something exists without 
you to actually go 
world find that thing 
right 
you a ton problems 
you find point c really would 
undermine that important lesson, right 
power mean value theorem lies 
in fact that you actually go 
compute value c, right 
power lies in fact, mean value 
theorem tells you that possible, that 
you know theres a value c there, 
without you actually go find 

that, opens door 
to interesting conceptual 
applications relating, say, 
positive derivative an interval to 
fact functions values increasing 
thats really power mean 
value theorem 
a conceptual result that helps you 
relate information derivative to 
information original function
