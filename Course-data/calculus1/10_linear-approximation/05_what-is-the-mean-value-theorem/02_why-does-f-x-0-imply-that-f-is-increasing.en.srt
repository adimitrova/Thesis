The mean value theorem has some other

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:11,342
applications where it connects derivative
information back to information about the

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:14,646
original function.
Well, here's a theorem.

4
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:19,332
Suppose the derivative of some function.
So I'm assuming it's a differential

5
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:23,562
function, is positive, it's greater than
zero on some open interval.

6
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:28,320
Then the function is an increasing
function, meaning that it sends, bigger

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,048
inputs to bigger outputs.
You probably already believe that

8
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,332
statement.
But the mean value theorem let's us verify

9
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:39,687
that it's actually true.
Okay, so let's prove, this result.

10
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:45,197
I'm going to pick, two points a and b, but
I want to make sure that I pick them in

11
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:48,243
order.
So I'm going to pick b bigger than a so I

12
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:51,131
can talk about the interval a b.
All right.

13
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:54,248
So I'll pick my two points.
Now I'm going to apply the mean value

14
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:58,057
theorem to the open interval a,b.
And that's OK because I'm going to pick a

15
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:02,152
and b to be in this open interval and
that's mean that f being differentiable

16
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:05,116
satisfies the conditions of the mean value
theorem.

17
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:09,812
The continuous on the closed interval a, b
and it will be differnetial on the open

18
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:10,951
interval a, b.
Okay.

19
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:17,383
So the mean value theorem then tells me to
look at f of v minus f of a over b minus

20
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:24,115
a, and the conclusion is that this is the
derivative of f at some mystery point in

21
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:27,892
between a and b.
Now the good news is I don't know much

22
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:31,656
about the derivative but I know the
derivative is positive.

23
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:35,280
So I know that f of b minus f of a over b
minus a is positive.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,926
The other thing that I know is that b is
greater than a and that means the

25
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,927
denominator here b minus a is also
positive.

26
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:47,602
So I've got mystery number divided by
positive is positive.

27
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:51,435
That means this numerator must also be
positive.

28
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:56,974
So f of b minus f of a is positive.
Now, if I add f of a to both sides, I get

29
00:01:56,974 --> 00:02:04,439
that f of b is bigger than f of a.
If f sends bigger inputs to bigger outputs

30
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,456
then f is increasing.
Increasing means that a bigger input is

31
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:15,438
sent to a bigger output.
So if b is greater than a then f of b is

32
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:21,710
bigger than f of a and this argument works
for any a and b In the open interval on

33
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,661
which I know the derivative is positive.
So I'm going to conclude that f is an

34
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:32,086
increasing function, which is exactly what
I wanted to show.

35
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:36,920
So if the derivative's positive on a whole
interval, then the function's increasing

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,130
on that interval.
But it's important to point out that I

37
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,551
needed to know the sign, the s i g n of
the derivative on that entire interval.

38
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:48,841
The mean value theorem ends of just
picking out a single point, that point c,

39
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:53,654
where it'll examine the derivative.
But in order to cover all my bases right

40
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:58,611
because I don't know what point c the mean
value theorem might make me look at .

41
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,636
I've got to control the sign the S I G N
on the derivative on the entire interval.

42
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:08,881
Alright, now I can play the same game when
the sign of the derivative is negative.

43
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:13,546
So, if I know the sign the SIG derivative
is negative on some open interval then I

44
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:18,288
include that F is a decreasing function.
And, again this is just an application of

45
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:20,884
the mean value theorem.
Let's see the proof.

46
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:24,754
So, I'm going to start out by again
picking two points a,b in my opening

47
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:29,170
interval and I'll again pick them so that
b is greater than a so I can talk about

48
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,702
the interval a,b.
And then applying the mean value theorem,

49
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:35,466
I should look at, f of b minus, f of a
over b minus a.

50
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,894
And the mean value theorem promises me
that this is the derivative at some point,

51
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:43,381
and I don't know what c is but it's the
derivative at some point.

52
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:48,061
But I know that the derivative at any
point Is negative so this must be

53
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,619
negative.
Now b minus a is positive because b's

54
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:55,852
bigger than a.
So I've got a number I don't know divided

55
00:03:55,852 --> 00:04:01,340
by a positive number is negative.
That means that f of b minus f of a must

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,287
be negative.
Then I add f of a to both sides and I can

57
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:10,814
conclude that f of b is less than f of a.
In other words, f sends bigger inputs to

58
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:14,204
smaller output.
Since f sends bigger inputs to smaller

59
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:18,790
outputs, f is a decreasing function.
Once again we're seeing that the mean

60
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,681
value theorem lets me relate information
about the derivative, in this case the

61
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,748
fact that the sign of the derivative is
negative.

62
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:31,434
Back to information about the original
function, in this case the function's

63
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:34,746
decreasing.
Alright, well lets summarize what we've

64
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:38,010
learned thus far.
So here are some applications of the mean

65
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,822
value theorem.
If f is differentiable on some open

66
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:45,178
interval and depending as to what happens
then we know something about f on that

67
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:48,197
interval.
So if the derivative is identically zero,

68
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:52,418
if the derivative is equal to zero no
matter what I plug in, then f is constant

69
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:57,575
on that interval.
If the derivative is positive no matter

70
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:02,931
what I plug in, then f is increasing on
that interval.

71
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:10,455
And, if the derivative is negative, then f
is decreasing on that interval.
