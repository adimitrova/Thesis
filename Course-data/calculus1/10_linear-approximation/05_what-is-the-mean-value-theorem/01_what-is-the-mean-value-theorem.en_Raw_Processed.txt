music information 
derivative connect back to information 
original function 
there is a technical tool that connects 
this differential information to 
value function that tool is 
mean value theorum 
well heres a statement mean value 
theorem 
suppose that f is continuous closed 
interval between a b, 
differentiable open interval a b 
so thats setup 
f is a pretty nice function 
there exist point in between a 
b, so a point in interval a b 
so that derivative function 
point c, is equal to this 
is really calculating slope 
between point a f a 
b f b 
that statement seems really complicated 
lets try to boil that to a statement 
we really believe in 
well, heres one interpretation 
if that function is giving you position 
input to that function is time, so 
that derivative that function is 
velocity, that formula is saying 
that average velocity is achieved, 
point instantaneously 
right 
that fraction, that difference ratio, is 
calculating average velocity 
instantaneous velocity is 
derivative 
mean value theorem is saying that 
equal point in between 
lets go back to official 
statement mean value theorem 
so here again, is statement 
mean value theorem, right, a nice enough 
function that theres point in 
middle so that derivative, 
instantaneous velocity is equal to this 
is, you know, if you like 
calculating average velocity 
we take a look this a graph 
well might help even 
right heres graph 
function that ive made 
ive picked points a b 
certainly a nice enough function 
i mean a continuous function a 
differentiable function, ive picked 
points a b 
heres f a f b ive 
drawn this red line that connects 
point a f a b f b 
slope that line is exactly 
this quantity calculates 
right, so ill label this slope 
that secant line 
now, if asserting existence 
point in between, derivative 
value slope this secant 
line you know, sort looks like, 
this picture, maybe that point is 
here 
and, yeah, looks like if i draw a 
tangent line to curve that point, 
slope that tangent line, is 
derivative point c, is 
slope that red secant line 
right 
so, in statement mean value 
theorem, this f prime c, thats 
slope tangent line 
to graph function point 
c, this statement is asserting that 
slope tangent line point in 
between is equal to slope 
secent line between a f a, b f 
b 
meanvalue theorem is often told a 
story somebody driving a car 
well heres story 
noon, youre in city a, 
pm 
youre driving car youve arrived 
in a city b, is miles away 
city a 
youre driving car youve arrived 
in a city b, is miles away 
city a 
meanvalue theorem say 
well, mean value theorem tells you 
that point in between, 
derivative is equal to slope 
secant line 
in this story means, that 
point journey, 
speedometer 
said miles per hour 
speedometers reporting 
instantaneous speed, right 
thats this, derivative 
position respect to time, 
point in between 
im claiming that point 
said miles per hour, thats 
average speed miles 
per hour, right 
in one hour you traveled miles 
thats exactly this difference 
quotient is calculating 
so point along journey, you 
must exceeded speed limit 
alright, so this is interesting, 
mean value theorem, really great 
is this used for, mean 
value theorem actually help us understand 
anything a function we know 
something derivative 
well, heres one important 
application a theorem 
youve got function f 
differentiable open interval 
that interval derivative is 
identically zero, so derivative is 
zero matter i plug in 
that function is constant that 
interval 
so a really exciting result, 
relating information 
derivative back to information 
value function 
saying that if derivative is 
equal to , that function outputs one 
value 
a constant function 
so lets prove this statement using 
valuable theorem, mvt, 
mean value theorem 
well here we go 
so i want to prove this im going 
to is im going to pick two points, 
ill call a b, in interval 
since f is differentiable whole 
interval ive picked a b inside 
that interval, this is actually enough to 
guarantee that hypotheses, mean 
value theorem, applied 
functions continuous closed 
interval differentiable open 
interval a b 
okay, that means value theorem 
applies 
so f b minus f a b minus a is 
equal to derivative f 
mystery point c in between a b 
matter i evaluate 
derivative assumption here is that 
derivative is identically 
so that is equal to 
this means that matter a b i 
pick f b minus f a b minus a is 
equal to 
a fraction equal to 
way fraction is equal to is 
if numerators equal to 
so that means that f b minus f a is 
equal to 
now, if i add f a to 
sides, i conclude that f b is equal to 
f a 
im really saying here, is that 
matter a b i pick, f a 
is equal to f b 
so, f, is a constant function, right 
two output values so 
there must one output value 
is exactly means to say 
function is constant
