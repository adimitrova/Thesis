music heres a fundamental question 
i multiply numbers really quickly 
like this is a particularly new 
problem 
you imagine somebody trying to 
multiply , , , , , , , 
getting , 
you know, would you ever 
kinds calculations if you trapped 
in a world filled roman numerals 
thankfully, instead roman numerals, 
weve got place value 
place value provides an algorithm 
actually computing multiplication 
answers 
so, here weve got , here ive got 
if i want to this multiplication 
problem, i to this single 
digit multiplies 
times is 
plus is 
times is 
plus is 
add numbers up, 
thats exactly i here in 
roman numerals 
if numbers much, much bigger 
digit numbers 
if two numbers i wanted to 
multiply digits 
well then, ive still gotta 
parawise multiplications 
right here, im going to end 
writing digits 
least digits 
every pair digits here, 
ive got to write least one digit 
here 
thats terrible 
you know, ive got to add 
things i im able 
to get answer 
i mean thats a ton work, right 
youd really hope that thered way 
to speed this 
there is a way to speed this 
theres a ton ways to speed 
multiplication 
multiplication is an important 
operation that humans given a ton 
thought 
weve really got a lot different ways 
to try to make this faster, maybe 
easiest way is that quarter squares 
so heres trick 
im going to use this table quarter 
squares 
this is n squared , a quarter 
square, so heres n, heres output 
if i plug in , i get a quarter 
if i plug in , squared is 
squared is a quarter 
squared is 
squared is a quarter 
okay, you image ive got a really big 
table quarter squares 
now, this help you multiply 
weve also got this little algebraic fact 
a times b is a plus b squared , 
quarter square a plus b minus a minus b 
squared 
so, instead multiplying a b, ill 
add together, look in 
table, take difference, look 
in table, take difference 
table values 
instance, lets suppose that i want to 
multiply times 
i mean, this is a ridiculously easy case 
to show works 
lets multiply times 
ill add i get 
i look in table 
squared is a quarter 
i take difference, minus is 
if i look in table, i get a 
quarter 
a quarter minus a quarter is 
is a product 
quarter squares convert multiplication 
an addition, a subtraction, two table 
lookups a final subtraction 
lets try this a much bigger 
number 
lets try to multiply using 
quarter squares 
so, first thing to is to figure 
quarter square plus 
plus is 
ive got a much bigger table quarter 
squares here 
heres table 
squared according to table is 
now, next step is to look 
difference , is , 
look that in table quarter 
squares 
heres 
quarter square is 
thats pretty clear 
squared is , divided 
so 
i to figure product 

well, im going to take , im going to 
subtract , im going to get , 
is in fact produce 
we using quarter squares, 
adding numbers together, taking 
difference, looking numbers 
in table taking 
difference numbers in table, i 
got product numbers 
admittedly, people dont talk much 
quarter squares nowadays 
youve probably heard a lot 
is logarithms 
theres this property exponents that e 
to x times e to y is e to x 
plus y 
corresponding property logs is that 
log a product is sum logs 
log a times b is log a plus log 
b 
you use this property logs to 
multiply quickly provided you a 
log table 
i a table logarithms 
heres table 
lets multiply 
so, instead looking , im going to 
look in table i find log 
is 
then, instead looking , im going 
to look in table, log 
is 
im going to add together two logs 
i get , i got to hunt 
that number in table 
mercifully, numbers in order i 
find that is right here in 
table thats in th column row 
starts 
so product must 
this works is that basic fact 
logs 
logs convert multiplication addition 
theres another way that we exploit 
this fact 
if ive got two plain old rulers, i 
use two rulers to add together 
numbers 
lets say, i want to add together 
ill is ill put top 
bottom so that this 
distance is units 
top, distance between 
is units 
so, if im going to add units to 
units, i read answer is 
if rulers, a logarithmic 
scale, youve invented slide 
rule 
this is a logarithmic scale, so this 
distance, scale labeled d, starting 
ending this , this distance 
is log 
now, next to that distance, i to 
place a distance whose length is log 
ive placed scale labeled 
c, d scale 
distance c scale that one 
way here to c 
scale, thats a distance is really 
log 
since ive placed two distances next 
to other, total distance is 
sum logs, is log 
product 
so, heres answer 
top scale is 
looks to , a little bit less 

now, i know last digit times 
is going to a 
so, answer must 
hundreds years, slide rules 
state art multiplying 
so that you join this proud 
tradition, i encourage you to print 
slide rule, try 
multiplication problems
