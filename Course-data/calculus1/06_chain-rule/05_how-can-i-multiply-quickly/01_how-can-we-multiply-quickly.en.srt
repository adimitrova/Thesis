00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:10,226
>> [music] Here's a fundamental question.
How can I multiply numbers really quickly.

2
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:16,257
It's not like this is a particularly new
problem.

3
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:25,038
You can imagine somebody trying to
multiply 10, 15, 17 by 10, 20, 30, 35, 36,

4
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:32,684
37 and getting 500, 600 and 29.
But you know, how would you ever do these

5
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:39,901
kinds of calculations if you were trapped
in a world filled with Roman numerals?

6
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:45,376
Thankfully, instead of Roman numerals,
we've got place value.

7
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:52,386
Place value provides an algorithm for
actually computing these multiplication

8
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,976
answers.
So, here we've got 17, here I've got 37.

9
00:00:56,976 --> 00:01:04,182
If I want to do this multiplication
problem, I just have to do this single

10
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:07,668
digit multiplies.
7 times 7 is 49.

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,636
7 plus 4 is 11.
3 times 7 is 21.

12
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:14,159
3 plus 2 is 5.
Add these numbers up, 629.

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
And that's exactly what I had here in
Roman numerals.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,867
What if the numbers were much, much bigger
than just 2 digit numbers?

15
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:27,668
What if the two numbers I wanted to
multiply each had 10 digits?

16
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:31,612
Well then, I've still gotta do all these
para-wise multiplications.

17
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:34,909
Right down here, I'm going to end up
writing 100 digits.

18
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,466
At least 100 digits.
Because for every pair of digits here,

19
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,515
I've got to write down at least one digit
down here.

20
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:44,922
That's terrible.
You know, and then I've got to add all of

21
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:48,814
these things up before I before I'm able
to get the answer.

22
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:53,696
I mean that's a ton of work, right?
You'd really hope that there'd be some way

23
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,911
to speed this up.
And there is a way to speed this up.

24
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,949
There's a ton of ways to speed up
multiplication.

25
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:04,765
Multiplication is such an important
operation that humans have given it a ton

26
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:08,188
of thought.
We've really got a lot of different ways

27
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:13,561
to try to make this faster, but maybe the
easiest way Is that of quarter squares.

28
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:17,803
So here's the trick.
I'm going to use this table of quarter

29
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:21,083
squares.
This is n squared over 4, a quarter

30
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:26,366
square, so here's n, here's the output.
If I plug in 1, I get a quarter.

31
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:31,701
If I plug in 2, 2 squared over 4 is 1.
3 squared over 4 is 2 and a quarter.

32
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:35,968
4 squared over 4 is 4.
5 squared over 4 is 6 and a quarter.

33
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:41,126
Okay, you can image I've got a really big
table of these quarter squares.

34
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:47,264
Now, why does this help you multiply?
We've also got this little algebraic fact.

35
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:52,838
A times b is a plus b squared over 4, the
quarter square of a plus b minus a minus b

36
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,762
squared over 4.
So, instead of multiplying a and b, I'll

37
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:01,802
add them together, look it up in the
table, take their difference, look it up

38
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:05,846
in the table, and take the difference of
those table values.

39
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:09,871
For instance, let's suppose that I want to
multiply 3 times 2.

40
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:14,761
I mean, this is a ridiculously easy case.
But just to show off how it works.

41
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,362
Let's multiply 3 times 2.
I'll add 3 and 2 and I get 5.

42
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:24,362
And I look it up in my table.
And 5 squared over 4 is 6 and a quarter.

43
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:30,379
I take the difference, 3 minus 2 is 1.
And if I look up 1 in my table, I get a

44
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,828
quarter.
And 6 and a quarter minus a quarter is 6.

45
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:40,215
Which is a product of 3 and 2.
Quarter squares convert multiplication

46
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:46,048
into an addition, a subtraction, two table
lookups and a final subtraction.

47
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,528
Let's try doing this on a much bigger
number.

48
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:54,376
Let's try to multiply 17 by 37 using
quarter squares.

49
00:03:54,376 --> 00:04:00,851
So, the first thing to do is to figure out
the quarter square of 17 plus 37.

50
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:05,667
17 plus 37 is 54.
I've got a much bigger table of quarter

51
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,951
squares here.
Here's 54 on my table.

52
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:13,507
54 squared over 4 according to my table is
729.

53
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:20,711
Now, the next step is to look at the
difference of 17 and 37, which is 20, and

54
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:25,072
look that up in my table of quarter
squares.

55
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:28,742
Here's 20.
And the quarter square of 20 is 100.

56
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:32,895
That's pretty clear.
20 squared is 400, divided by 4.

57
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,633
So 100.
Now what do I do to figure out the product

58
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:40,167
of 17 and 37?
Well, I'm going to take 729, I'm going to

59
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:45,120
subtract 100, and I'm going to get 629,
which is in fact the produce of 17 and 37.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,486
But we did it using quarter squares, by
just adding the numbers together, taking

61
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:55,526
their difference, looking up those numbers
in the table and then taking the

62
00:04:55,526 --> 00:05:00,676
difference of the numbers in the table, I
got the product of these 2 numbers.

63
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:06,571
Admittedly, people don't talk too much
about quarter squares nowadays.

64
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:11,354
What you've probably heard a lot more
about is logarithms.

65
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:17,560
There's this property of exponents that e
to the x times e to the y is e to the x

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,791
plus y.
The corresponding property of logs is that

67
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:28,282
log of a product is the sum of the logs.
The log of a times b is log of a plus log

68
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:31,864
of b.
You can use this property of logs to

69
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:36,597
multiply very quickly provided you have a
log table.

70
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:41,198
And I do have a table of logarithms.
Here's my table.

71
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:46,734
Let's multiply 17 by 37.
So, instead of looking up 17, I'm going to

72
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:51,947
look 1.70 in my table and I find the log
of 1.70 is about 0.23045.

73
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:59,753
Then, instead of looking up 37, I'm going
to look up 3.70 in my table, and the log

74
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:05,663
of 3.70 is about 0.56820.
I'm going to add together those two logs

75
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:11,343
and I get 0.79865, and I just got to hunt
for that number in my table.

76
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:22,009
Mercifully, the numbers are in order and I
find that 0.79865 is right here in my

77
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:30,632
table that's in the 9th column of the row
which starts with 6.2.

78
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:39,149
So the product of 17 and 37 must be 629.
Why this works is that same basic fact

79
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,700
about logs again.
Logs convert multiplication into addition.

80
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,352
There's another way that we can exploit
this fact.

81
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:52,776
If I've just got two plain old rulers, I
can use the two rulers to add together

82
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:56,415
numbers.
Let's say, I want to add 3 and 2 together.

83
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:02,450
What I'll do is I'll put the 0 on the top
above the 2 on the bottom so that this

84
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,267
distance is 2 units.
On the top, the distance between 0 and 3

85
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,698
is 3 units.
So, if I'm going to add 2 units to 3

86
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:14,057
units, I just read down and the answer is
5.

87
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:20,936
If your 2 rulers, have a logarithmic
scale, then you've just invented the slide

88
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:24,775
rule.
This is a logarithmic scale, so this

89
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:32,187
distance, on the scale labeled D, starting
at 1 and ending at this 7, this distance

90
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:36,793
is log of 1.7.
Now, next to that distance, I have to

91
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:40,781
place a distance whose length is log of
3.7.

92
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:47,907
Now I've placed the 1 on the scale labeled
C, just above the 7 on the D scale.

93
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:53,808
The distance on the C scale from that one
all the way over here to 3.7 on the C

94
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:58,005
scale, that's a distance which is really
log of 3.7.

95
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:04,171
Since I've placed these two distances next
to each other, the total distance is just

96
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:07,982
the sum of the logs, which is the log of
the product.

97
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:13,519
So, here's the answer.
Just below 3.7 on the top scale is what

98
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,941
looks to be 6.3, just a little bit less
than 6.3.

99
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:22,876
Now, I know the last digit of 17 times 37
is going to be a 9.

100
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:30,034
So, the answer must be 6.29.
For hundreds of years, these slide rules

101
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:37,261
were state of the art for multiplying.
So that you can join into this proud

102
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:44,996
tradition, I encourage you to print out
your own slide rule, and try doing some

103
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:48,221
multiplication problems on it.
