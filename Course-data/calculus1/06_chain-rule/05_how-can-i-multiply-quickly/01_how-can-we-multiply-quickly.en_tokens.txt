here
's
a
fundamental
question
.
how
can
i
multiply
numbers
really
quickly
.
it
's
not
like
this
is
a
particularly
new
problem
.
you
can
imagine
somebody
trying
to
multiply
10
,
15
,
17
by
10
,
20
,
30
,
35
,
36
,
37
and
getting
500
,
600
and
29.
but
you
know
,
how
would
you
ever
do
these
kinds
of
calculations
if
you
were
trapped
in
a
world
filled
with
roman
numerals
?
thankfully
,
instead
of
roman
numerals
,
we
've
got
place
value
.
place
value
provides
an
algorithm
for
actually
computing
these
multiplication
answers
.
so
,
here
we
've
got
17
,
here
i
've
got
37.
if
i
want
to
do
this
multiplication
problem
,
i
just
have
to
do
this
single
digit
multiplies
.
7
times
7
is
49
.
7
plus
4
is
11
.
3
times
7
is
21
.
3
plus
2
is
5.
add
these
numbers
up
,
629.
and
that
's
exactly
what
i
had
here
in
roman
numerals
.
what
if
the
numbers
were
much
,
much
bigger
than
just
2
digit
numbers
?
what
if
the
two
numbers
i
wanted
to
multiply
each
had
10
digits
?
well
then
,
i
've
still
got
ta
do
all
these
para-wise
multiplications
.
right
down
here
,
i
'm
going
to
end
up
writing
100
digits
.
at
least
100
digits
.
because
for
every
pair
of
digits
here
,
i
've
got
to
write
down
at
least
one
digit
down
here
.
that
's
terrible
.
you
know
,
and
then
i
've
got
to
add
all
of
these
things
up
before
i
before
i
'm
able
to
get
the
answer
.
i
mean
that
's
a
ton
of
work
,
right
?
you
'd
really
hope
that
there
'd
be
some
way
to
speed
this
up
.
and
there
is
a
way
to
speed
this
up
.
there
's
a
ton
of
ways
to
speed
up
multiplication
.
multiplication
is
such
an
important
operation
that
humans
have
given
it
a
ton
of
thought
.
we
've
really
got
a
lot
of
different
ways
to
try
to
make
this
faster
,
but
maybe
the
easiest
way
is
that
of
quarter
squares
.
so
here
's
the
trick
.
i
'm
going
to
use
this
table
of
quarter
squares
.
this
is
n
squared
over
4
,
a
quarter
square
,
so
here
's
n
,
here
's
the
output
.
if
i
plug
in
1
,
i
get
a
quarter
.
if
i
plug
in
2
,
2
squared
over
4
is
1
.
3
squared
over
4
is
2
and
a
quarter
.
4
squared
over
4
is
4
.
5
squared
over
4
is
6
and
a
quarter
.
okay
,
you
can
image
i
've
got
a
really
big
table
of
these
quarter
squares
.
now
,
why
does
this
help
you
multiply
?
we
've
also
got
this
little
algebraic
fact
.
a
times
b
is
a
plus
b
squared
over
4
,
the
quarter
square
of
a
plus
b
minus
a
minus
b
squared
over
4.
so
,
instead
of
multiplying
a
and
b
,
i
'll
add
them
together
,
look
it
up
in
the
table
,
take
their
difference
,
look
it
up
in
the
table
,
and
take
the
difference
of
those
table
values
.
for
instance
,
let
's
suppose
that
i
want
to
multiply
3
times
2.
i
mean
,
this
is
a
ridiculously
easy
case
.
but
just
to
show
off
how
it
works
.
let
's
multiply
3
times
2.
i
'll
add
3
and
2
and
i
get
5.
and
i
look
it
up
in
my
table
.
and
5
squared
over
4
is
6
and
a
quarter
.
i
take
the
difference
,
3
minus
2
is
1.
and
if
i
look
up
1
in
my
table
,
i
get
a
quarter
.
and
6
and
a
quarter
minus
a
quarter
is
6.
which
is
a
product
of
3
and
2.
quarter
squares
convert
multiplication
into
an
addition
,
a
subtraction
,
two
table
lookups
and
a
final
subtraction
.
let
's
try
doing
this
on
a
much
bigger
number
.
let
's
try
to
multiply
17
by
37
using
quarter
squares
.
so
,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
figure
out
the
quarter
square
of
17
plus
37
.
17
plus
37
is
54.
i
've
got
a
much
bigger
table
of
quarter
squares
here
.
here
's
54
on
my
table
.
54
squared
over
4
according
to
my
table
is
now
,
the
next
step
is
to
look
at
the
difference
of
17
and
37
,
which
is
20
,
and
look
that
up
in
my
table
of
quarter
squares
.
here
's
20.
and
the
quarter
square
of
20
is
100.
that
's
pretty
clear
.
20
squared
is
400
,
divided
by
4.
so
100.
now
what
do
i
do
to
figure
out
the
product
of
17
and
37
?
well
,
i
'm
going
to
take
729
,
i
'm
going
to
subtract
100
,
and
i
'm
going
to
get
629
,
which
is
in
fact
the
produce
of
17
and
37.
but
we
did
it
using
quarter
squares
,
by
just
adding
the
numbers
together
,
taking
their
difference
,
looking
up
those
numbers
in
the
table
and
then
taking
the
difference
of
the
numbers
in
the
table
,
i
got
the
product
of
these
2
numbers
.
admittedly
,
people
do
n't
talk
too
much
about
quarter
squares
nowadays
.
what
you
've
probably
heard
a
lot
more
about
is
logarithms
.
there
's
this
property
of
exponents
that
e
to
the
x
times
e
to
the
y
is
e
to
the
x
plus
y.
the
corresponding
property
of
logs
is
that
log
of
a
product
is
the
sum
of
the
logs
.
the
log
of
a
times
b
is
log
of
a
plus
log
of
b.
you
can
use
this
property
of
logs
to
multiply
very
quickly
provided
you
have
a
log
table
.
and
i
do
have
a
table
of
logarithms
.
here
's
my
table
.
let
's
multiply
17
by
37.
so
,
instead
of
looking
up
17
,
i
'm
going
to
look
1.70
in
my
table
and
i
find
the
log
of
1.70
is
about
0.23045.
then
,
instead
of
looking
up
37
,
i
'm
going
to
look
up
3.70
in
my
table
,
and
the
log
of
3.70
is
about
0.56820.
i
'm
going
to
add
together
those
two
logs
and
i
get
0.79865
,
and
i
just
got
to
hunt
for
that
number
in
my
table
.
mercifully
,
the
numbers
are
in
order
and
i
find
that
0.79865
is
right
here
in
my
table
that
's
in
the
9th
column
of
the
row
which
starts
with
6.2.
so
the
product
of
17
and
37
must
be
629.
why
this
works
is
that
same
basic
fact
about
logs
again
.
logs
convert
multiplication
into
addition
.
there
's
another
way
that
we
can
exploit
this
fact
.
if
i
've
just
got
two
plain
old
rulers
,
i
can
use
the
two
rulers
to
add
together
numbers
.
let
's
say
,
i
want
to
add
3
and
2
together
.
what
i
'll
do
is
i
'll
put
the
0
on
the
top
above
the
2
on
the
bottom
so
that
this
distance
is
2
units
.
on
the
top
,
the
distance
between
0
and
3
is
3
units
.
so
,
if
i
'm
going
to
add
2
units
to
3
units
,
i
just
read
down
and
the
answer
is
if
your
2
rulers
,
have
a
logarithmic
scale
,
then
you
've
just
invented
the
slide
rule
.
this
is
a
logarithmic
scale
,
so
this
distance
,
on
the
scale
labeled
d
,
starting
at
1
and
ending
at
this
7
,
this
distance
is
log
of
1.7.
now
,
next
to
that
distance
,
i
have
to
place
a
distance
whose
length
is
log
of
now
i
've
placed
the
1
on
the
scale
labeled
c
,
just
above
the
7
on
the
d
scale
.
the
distance
on
the
c
scale
from
that
one
all
the
way
over
here
to
3.7
on
the
c
scale
,
that
's
a
distance
which
is
really
log
of
3.7.
since
i
've
placed
these
two
distances
next
to
each
other
,
the
total
distance
is
just
the
sum
of
the
logs
,
which
is
the
log
of
the
product
.
so
,
here
's
the
answer
.
just
below
3.7
on
the
top
scale
is
what
looks
to
be
6.3
,
just
a
little
bit
less
than
6.3.
now
,
i
know
the
last
digit
of
17
times
37
is
going
to
be
a
9.
so
,
the
answer
must
be
6.29.
for
hundreds
of
years
,
these
slide
rules
were
state
of
the
art
for
multiplying
.
so
that
you
can
join
into
this
proud
tradition
,
i
encourage
you
to
print
out
your
own
slide
rule
,
and
try
doing
some
multiplication
problems
on
it
.
