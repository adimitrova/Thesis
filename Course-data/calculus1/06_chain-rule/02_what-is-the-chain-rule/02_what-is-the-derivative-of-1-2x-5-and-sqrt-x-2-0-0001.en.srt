1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,060
, I want to differentiate really
complicated functions. As a concrete

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:15,019
example take a look at the function f of x
equals 1 plus 2x to the fifth power. Let's

3
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:22,541
try to differentiate this function. We
could approach this in a couple different

4
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:29,839
ways. First of all, I could just expand it
out. Alright. So I'm just going to expand

5
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:37,493
this out 1 to the fifth is just one, plus
ten x, plus 40 x squared, plus 80 x cubed,

6
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:45,101
plus 80 x to the fourth, plus 32 x to the
5th. Now, it's just a polynomial so I can

7
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:52,259
fearlessly differentiate it. So, f prime
of x, by differentiate this, the

8
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:59,031
derivative of one is zero, the derivative
of ten x is ten, the derivative of 40 x

9
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:09,630
squared is 80 x, and 240 x squared, 320 x
cubed, and 160 x to the fourth. Of course,

10
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:21,675
if we're clever at this point, we can also
see that this mess factors. So it's sort

11
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:29,949
of believable as a factor of ten here,
since all of these coefficients end in a

12
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:37,227
zero. This is ten times one plus eight x
plus 24 x squared plus 32 x cubed plus 16

13
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:43,711
x to the fourth. What's way less obvious,
I mean not obvious at all, is that this

14
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:48,560
mess also factors. It happens to be one
plus two x to the fourth power. This is

15
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:53,807
not an accident. What if we instead
applied the change rule to original

16
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,602
problem? So let's compute the derivative
to the change rule. The first step is

17
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:05,314
we're going to split up the function f
into a composition of two functions, g and

18
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:10,797
h, g here, the outside function is the
fifth power function, and h, the inside

19
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:15,250
function is one plus two x. So if I
combine those two functions, save the

20
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:20,690
composition, I get back f. Now, I want to
differentiate f and, by the chain rule,

21
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:26,562
that's the derivative of the outside, add
the inside function, times the derivative

22
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:33,240
of the inside function. In this case, what
is the derivative of the outside function?

23
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:38,566
The derivative of g is five x to the
fourth. So I'm going to take that but if

24
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:43,984
evaluate it at h. five h of x to the
fourth multiply by the derivative of h.

25
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:50,306
What is the derivative of h? Well, it's
two. Well, look what I got here. I've got

26
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,477
five, h of x is one plus two x to the
fourth times two, that's ten times one

27
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,976
plus two x to the fourth, that's exactly
what we calculated before. It's really

28
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:05,593
nice example, because it shows that we're
doing the same calculation. We're

29
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:11,151
calculating derivative of the function one
plus two x to the fifth power, but we're

30
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:16,280
doing it in two different ways,
nevertheless, we get the same answer.

31
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:22,825
Somehow, mathematics is conspiring to be
consistent. Okay, well, let's try another

32
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:29,115
example. Well, here's a more complicated
function, f of x equals the square root of

33
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:34,569
x squared plus 0.0001. What's the
derivative of f? We can't simply expand

34
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:40,089
this function out, and in fact, if you
graph the function, you might think that

35
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:45,743
the function is not differential, because
the graph of the function has this sharp

36
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:51,238
corner at the origin, but let's zoom in
and see what this actually looks like if

37
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:59,158
we zoom in close enough. If we zoom in
close enough, the thing doesn't look like

38
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,911
it has a sharp corner anymore. It actually
looks like it's curved and if we zoom in

39
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:12,868
any further, the thing would look more and
more like a straight line. What we're

40
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,853
really seeing is the function is
differentiable. Now, we can verify this

41
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:21,279
algebraically, we can use our derivative
laws, like a change rule, to actually

42
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:26,054
calculate the derivative of this function.
We'll differentiate this by using the

43
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:30,382
change rule since this is really a
composition of two functions. This is a

44
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:34,995
composition of the square root function
and this polynomial, x squared plus

45
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:39,951
0.0001. Alright, so the derivative of f is
the derivative of the outside function,

46
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:44,622
which is the derivative of the square
root, which is 1 over 2 square root And

47
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:49,619
it's the derivative of the outside
function evaluated at the inside, which is

48
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:55,178
x squared plus 0.0001. I have to multiply
by the derivative of the inside function.

49
00:04:55,292 --> 00:05:00,941
What is the derivative of x squared plus
0.0001? Well, that's the derivative of the

50
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:06,415
x squared, since it's a constant and the
derivative of x squared is two x. So the

51
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:13,833
dirivitave of f is one over two t imes the
square root of x squared plus 0.0001 times

52
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:20,918
two x. I could make that a little bit
nicer looking. I could cancel these twos

53
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,583
and write this as x over the square root
of x squared plus 0.0001. What happens at

54
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:34,880
zero? So let compute the derivative at
zero. Well, if I plug in zero for x, I've

55
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:40,080
got zero over zero squared plus 0.0001.
The denominator is not zero, the numerator

56
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:45,085
is zero, the derivative at zero is zero
and you can see that from the graph. If I

57
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:50,391
look at when x equals zero, the tangent
line at that point is horizontal, the

58
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:54,848
slope of that tangent line is zero. The
derivative at zero is zero, and there's

59
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,025
more awesome things that you can see by
looking at the derivative. If you look at,

60
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:05,202
say, the limit of the derivative as x
approaches infinity, that's the limit of

61
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:10,379
this quantity, which is one, and the limit
of the derivative as x approaches minus

62
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:15,707
infinity is negative one and you can see
this visibly on the graph of the function.

63
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:20,366
If you plug in a really big number and
look at the tangent line there, that

64
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:25,483
tangent line has slope close to one. And,
if you plug in areally negative number and

65
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:30,556
look at the tangent line there, That
tangent line has slope close to minus one.

66
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:36,270
Our derivative rules are revealing facts
that are hidden. This function looks like

67
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:41,513
it's got a sharp corner, but we know, by
applying our differentiation rules, by

68
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:46,846
using the change rule, that this function
is in fact differentiable. And we know

69
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:52,126
that if we zoom in close enough, the thing
looks like a straight line, the derivative

70
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:55,801
rules really revealing this structure at
very small scales.
