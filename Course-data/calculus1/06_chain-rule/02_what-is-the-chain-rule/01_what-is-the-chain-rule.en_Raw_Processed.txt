music many functions that wed 
like to differentiate actually 
compositions two different functions 
this happens in real world, i 
mean, look, if you change number 
flowers, thats going to affect say 
many rabbits there around to you know, 
eat flowers if you change 
rabbits, thatll affect many 
wolves that forest support theres 
really concrete examples this 
heres a concrete example suppose that f 
x is number widgets produced 
an investment x dollars, right 
with, money, maybe, you 
build widgets suppose g n is 
income that you get selling n 
widgets youre probably really 
interested in is exactly many 
widgets you produce youd like to 
know is, a given investment, much 
money you going to make, right well, 
thats g f x minus initial 
investment, right, g f x is much 
money comes in you sell widgets 
that you produced initial 
investment x dollars, right this 
quantity is measuring profit an 
investment x dollars in widget 
production we need framework, 
general picture that lets us understand 
one thing changing affects something 
else that things changing goes 
to affect something else specifically, if 
ive got function h is a 
composition two functions, g f x 
in this case, id like to know something 
derivative h i want to know 
changing x affects f 
changing f goes to affect g id 
like sort formula that gives 
that answer, right id like to know 
derivative h in terms information 
x is changing affects f 
changing input to g affects g i want 
a formula derivative h in terms 
derivatives f derivative 
g this is exactly chain rule 
chain rule says, is that 
derivative composition is 
derivative g evaluated f x times 
derivative f evaluated x 
sometimes, people idea that 
chain rule looks somehow, that youd 
really expect formula to look 
different i mean sometimes people think 
this formula looks a little bit weird, you 
know im composing functions, 
derivative g composes a 
function f whats going you might 
think that given fact that 
derivative a sum is sum 
derivatives you might tempted to think 
that derivative a composition 
composition derivatives, 
thats case chain 
rule really is capturing happens 
you chain together changes so lets 
think this chain rule, 
derivative g f x is g prime f 
x times f prime x in terms chaining 
together different changes im trying to 
calculate is changing x changes g f 
x right this is derivative 
composition i know well, i know 
changing x will change f x, right 
this is derivative f is, is, 
is measuring, right derivative is 
ratio output change to input change 
now, in between here, i is 
change in f x will change g f x 
in way this ratio changes is 
really derivative g point 
f x is derivative you plug 
in an input to derivative to ask 
wiggling that input would effect 
output thats exactly this ratio 
is im asking will f x is changing 
affect g f x, right thats 
derivative g point thats 
wiggling, f x 
well, if you think it, now, if i 
multiply two things together, 
i get change in g f x 
divided change in x this is 
chain rule, right if i multiply together 
g prime f x f prime x, im 
left is exactly i want, 
derivative g f x you see 
this pictorially well so here, ive 
drawn three number lines first 
number line, ive drawn x i imagine x 
is input to f second 
number line, ive drawn f x f x 
is input to g last 
number line, ive drawn g f x 
essential question answered 
derivative is changing x will affect g 
f x since this is a composition 
functions, im going to analyze 
effect changing x g f x in 
stages, right im first going to see 
this changing x affect f x f 
x is changing affect g f x so lets 
imagine that i change x a small 
quantity im calling that small quantity 
h here, h is a function, 
small number, amount im 
wiggling input now, is output 
affected well, thats exactly 
derivative measures right derivative 
f x tells wiggling input 
x would affect output so f prime 
x, is ratio output change to 
input change times an actual input change 
gives a first order approximation 
output change so i imagine output 
is changing f prime x times h 
now, that change in value f 
x affect g well, i to figure 
wiggling input to g will affect 
output g that depends im 
calculating derivative i need to 
calculate derivative g point 
f x, because, f x is point 
thats wiggling so, 
derivative g point f x that 
tells wiggling input around f 
x would affect output to g so 
that derivative times amount 
input changed, is this quantity 
here, f prime x times h you 
look this way, you see that 
an input change to x small amount 
h, output changes g prime f 
x times f prime x much, is 
exactly chain rule is telling 
case since this is 
correct rule, that chain rule really 
is derivative outside 
inside times derivative fu nction 
lets try to see a numerical example 
this thing in action so a numerical 
example lets consider function g x 
equals x to th power function 
f x equals plus x to rd power 
andm maybe i want to try to estimate 
is g f , now, 
approximately is that equal to well, 
hard to calculate g of, , 
right whats f well, thats plus 
cubed, well, thats so whats g 
well, thats to th, well, thats 
so i know that g f is 
going to close to question is, 
is wiggling input to 
going to affect output this 
composition functions well, i could 
in stages, right thats chain 
rules telling to so i could 
calculate first derivative f 
right derivative f is plus 
x squared, so derivative f is 
indeed, if i calculate f , 
thats a bit now, i 
want to try to calculate changing 
input to g will affect output g so 
i calculate derivative g 
thats x cubed power rule, 
i evaluate derivative 
g first temptation is to calculate 
derivative g , that is 
a good idea, youre wiggling 
input to g youre really 
calculating is derivative 
g , this thats going 
to wiggling you wiggle input 
to f, output to f, f , thats 
going to changing, so you 
calculate derivative g there 
is that thats times cubed, 
thats times , thats 
so trying to calculate is g 
f we know that thats 
g of, well, whats f 
so happens i wiggle 
input g to well, that 
output g 
is plus much i change input by, 
times derivative g point 
wiggli ng is happening, is 
thats whats plus 
times , thats so g f 
is you see 
this chain rule, right 
relevant thing to calculate is g prime 
f times f prime , right this 
is going to tell wiggling input 
affects output g prime f 
is , f prime is , times 
is so, thats chain rule 
going to take time chain rule 
to really sink in chain rule is 
super important two different 
reasons one hand, youve ta know 
chain rule to able to compute 
derivatives a lot functions that 
youll asked to differentiate 
actually compositions differentiable 
functions, so youll need to use chain 
rule to finish derivative 
calculations hand, 
youve gotta know chain rule to 
understand chained together changes 
work in real world, a lot things 
change, changing things affect 
things, changing things, 
go to affect yet things 
youve got, got understand 
changes get composed together, in order to 
really understand real world 
works
