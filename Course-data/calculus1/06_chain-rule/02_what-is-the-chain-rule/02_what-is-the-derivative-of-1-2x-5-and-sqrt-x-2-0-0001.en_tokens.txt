,
i
want
to
differentiate
really
complicated
functions
.
as
a
concrete
example
take
a
look
at
the
function
f
of
x
equals
1
plus
2x
to
the
fifth
power
.
let
's
try
to
differentiate
this
function
.
we
could
approach
this
in
a
couple
different
ways
.
first
of
all
,
i
could
just
expand
it
out
.
alright
.
so
i
'm
just
going
to
expand
this
out
1
to
the
fifth
is
just
one
,
plus
ten
x
,
plus
40
x
squared
,
plus
80
x
cubed
,
plus
80
x
to
the
fourth
,
plus
32
x
to
the
5th
.
now
,
it
's
just
a
polynomial
so
i
can
fearlessly
differentiate
it
.
so
,
f
prime
of
x
,
by
differentiate
this
,
the
derivative
of
one
is
zero
,
the
derivative
of
ten
x
is
ten
,
the
derivative
of
40
x
squared
is
80
x
,
and
240
x
squared
,
320
x
cubed
,
and
160
x
to
the
fourth
.
of
course
,
if
we
're
clever
at
this
point
,
we
can
also
see
that
this
mess
factors
.
so
it
's
sort
of
believable
as
a
factor
of
ten
here
,
since
all
of
these
coefficients
end
in
a
zero
.
this
is
ten
times
one
plus
eight
x
plus
24
x
squared
plus
32
x
cubed
plus
16
x
to
the
fourth
.
what
's
way
less
obvious
,
i
mean
not
obvious
at
all
,
is
that
this
mess
also
factors
.
it
happens
to
be
one
plus
two
x
to
the
fourth
power
.
this
is
not
an
accident
.
what
if
we
instead
applied
the
change
rule
to
original
problem
?
so
let
's
compute
the
derivative
to
the
change
rule
.
the
first
step
is
we
're
going
to
split
up
the
function
f
into
a
composition
of
two
functions
,
g
and
h
,
g
here
,
the
outside
function
is
the
fifth
power
function
,
and
h
,
the
inside
function
is
one
plus
two
x.
so
if
i
combine
those
two
functions
,
save
the
composition
,
i
get
back
f.
now
,
i
want
to
differentiate
f
and
,
by
the
chain
rule
,
that
's
the
derivative
of
the
outside
,
add
the
inside
function
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
.
in
this
case
,
what
is
the
derivative
of
the
outside
function
?
the
derivative
of
g
is
five
x
to
the
fourth
.
so
i
'm
going
to
take
that
but
if
evaluate
it
at
h.
five
h
of
x
to
the
fourth
multiply
by
the
derivative
of
h.
what
is
the
derivative
of
h
?
well
,
it
's
two
.
well
,
look
what
i
got
here
.
i
've
got
five
,
h
of
x
is
one
plus
two
x
to
the
fourth
times
two
,
that
's
ten
times
one
plus
two
x
to
the
fourth
,
that
's
exactly
what
we
calculated
before
.
it
's
really
nice
example
,
because
it
shows
that
we
're
doing
the
same
calculation
.
we
're
calculating
derivative
of
the
function
one
plus
two
x
to
the
fifth
power
,
but
we
're
doing
it
in
two
different
ways
,
nevertheless
,
we
get
the
same
answer
.
somehow
,
mathematics
is
conspiring
to
be
consistent
.
okay
,
well
,
let
's
try
another
example
.
well
,
here
's
a
more
complicated
function
,
f
of
x
equals
the
square
root
of
x
squared
plus
0.0001.
what
's
the
derivative
of
f
?
we
ca
n't
simply
expand
this
function
out
,
and
in
fact
,
if
you
graph
the
function
,
you
might
think
that
the
function
is
not
differential
,
because
the
graph
of
the
function
has
this
sharp
corner
at
the
origin
,
but
let
's
zoom
in
and
see
what
this
actually
looks
like
if
we
zoom
in
close
enough
.
if
we
zoom
in
close
enough
,
the
thing
does
n't
look
like
it
has
a
sharp
corner
anymore
.
it
actually
looks
like
it
's
curved
and
if
we
zoom
in
any
further
,
the
thing
would
look
more
and
more
like
a
straight
line
.
what
we
're
really
seeing
is
the
function
is
differentiable
.
now
,
we
can
verify
this
algebraically
,
we
can
use
our
derivative
laws
,
like
a
change
rule
,
to
actually
calculate
the
derivative
of
this
function
.
we
'll
differentiate
this
by
using
the
change
rule
since
this
is
really
a
composition
of
two
functions
.
this
is
a
composition
of
the
square
root
function
and
this
polynomial
,
x
squared
plus
0.0001.
alright
,
so
the
derivative
of
f
is
the
derivative
of
the
outside
function
,
which
is
the
derivative
of
the
square
root
,
which
is
1
over
2
square
root
and
it
's
the
derivative
of
the
outside
function
evaluated
at
the
inside
,
which
is
x
squared
plus
0.0001.
i
have
to
multiply
by
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
.
what
is
the
derivative
of
x
squared
plus
0.0001
?
well
,
that
's
the
derivative
of
the
x
squared
,
since
it
's
a
constant
and
the
derivative
of
x
squared
is
two
x.
so
the
dirivitave
of
f
is
one
over
two
t
imes
the
square
root
of
x
squared
plus
0.0001
times
two
x.
i
could
make
that
a
little
bit
nicer
looking
.
i
could
cancel
these
twos
and
write
this
as
x
over
the
square
root
of
x
squared
plus
0.0001.
what
happens
at
zero
?
so
let
compute
the
derivative
at
zero
.
well
,
if
i
plug
in
zero
for
x
,
i
've
got
zero
over
zero
squared
plus
0.0001.
the
denominator
is
not
zero
,
the
numerator
is
zero
,
the
derivative
at
zero
is
zero
and
you
can
see
that
from
the
graph
.
if
i
look
at
when
x
equals
zero
,
the
tangent
line
at
that
point
is
horizontal
,
the
slope
of
that
tangent
line
is
zero
.
the
derivative
at
zero
is
zero
,
and
there
's
more
awesome
things
that
you
can
see
by
looking
at
the
derivative
.
if
you
look
at
,
say
,
the
limit
of
the
derivative
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
that
's
the
limit
of
this
quantity
,
which
is
one
,
and
the
limit
of
the
derivative
as
x
approaches
minus
infinity
is
negative
one
and
you
can
see
this
visibly
on
the
graph
of
the
function
.
if
you
plug
in
a
really
big
number
and
look
at
the
tangent
line
there
,
that
tangent
line
has
slope
close
to
one
.
and
,
if
you
plug
in
areally
negative
number
and
look
at
the
tangent
line
there
,
that
tangent
line
has
slope
close
to
minus
one
.
our
derivative
rules
are
revealing
facts
that
are
hidden
.
this
function
looks
like
it
's
got
a
sharp
corner
,
but
we
know
,
by
applying
our
differentiation
rules
,
by
using
the
change
rule
,
that
this
function
is
in
fact
differentiable
.
and
we
know
that
if
we
zoom
in
close
enough
,
the
thing
looks
like
a
straight
line
,
the
derivative
rules
really
revealing
this
structure
at
very
small
scales
.
