, i want to differentiate really 
complicated functions a concrete 
example take a look function f x 
equals plus x to fifth power lets 
try to differentiate this function we 
could approach this in a couple different 
ways first all, i could expand 
alright so im going to expand 
this to fifth is one, plus 
ten x, plus x squared, plus x cubed, 
plus x to fourth, plus x to 
th now, a polynomial so i 
fearlessly differentiate so, f prime 
x, differentiate this, 
derivative one is zero, derivative 
ten x is ten, derivative x 
squared is x, x squared, x 
cubed, x to fourth course, 
if clever this point, we also 
see that this mess factors so sort 
believable a factor ten here, 
since coefficients end in a 
zero this is ten times one plus eight x 
plus x squared plus x cubed plus 
x to fourth whats way less obvious, 
i mean obvious all, is that this 
mess also factors happens to one 
plus two x to fourth power this is 
an accident if we instead 
applied change rule to original 
problem so lets compute derivative 
to change rule first step is 
going to split function f 
a composition two functions, g 
h, g here, outside function is 
fifth power function, h, inside 
function is one plus two x so if i 
combine two functions, save 
composition, i get back f now, i want to 
differentiate f and, chain rule, 
thats derivative outside, add 
inside function, times derivative 
inside function in this case, 
is derivative outside function 
derivative g is five x to 
fourth so im going to take that if 
evaluate h five h x to 
fourth multiply derivative h 
is derivative h well, 
two well, look i got here ive got 
five, h x is one plus two x to 
fourth times two, thats ten times one 
plus two x to fourth, thats exactly 
we calculated really 
nice example, shows that 
calculation 
calculating derivative function one 
plus two x to fifth power, 
in two different ways, 
nevertheless, we get answer 
somehow, mathematics is conspiring to 
consistent okay, well, lets try another 
example well, heres a complicated 
function, f x equals square root 
x squared plus whats 
derivative f we cant simply expand 
this function out, in fact, if you 
graph function, you might think that 
function is differential, 
graph function this sharp 
corner origin, lets zoom in 
see this actually looks like if 
we zoom in close enough if we zoom in 
close enough, thing doesnt look like 
a sharp corner anymore actually 
looks like curved if we zoom in 
further, thing would look 
like a straight line 
really seeing is function is 
differentiable now, we verify this 
algebraically, we use derivative 
laws, like a change rule, to actually 
calculate derivative this function 
well differentiate this using 
change rule since this is really a 
composition two functions this is a 
composition square root function 
this polynomial, x squared plus 
alright, so derivative f is 
derivative outside function, 
is derivative square 
root, is square root 
derivative outside 
function evaluated inside, is 
x squared plus i to multiply 
derivative inside function 
is derivative x squared plus 
well, thats derivative 
x squared, since a constant 
derivative x squared is two x so 
dirivitave f is one two imes 
square root x squared plus times 
two x i could make that a little bit 
nicer looking i could cancel twos 
write this x square root 
x squared plus happens 
zero so let compute derivative 
zero well, if i plug in zero x, ive 
got zero zero squared plus 
denominator is zero, numerator 
is zero, derivative zero is zero 
you see that graph if i 
look x equals zero, tangent 
line that point is horizontal, 
slope that tangent line is zero 
derivative zero is zero, theres 
awesome things that you see 
looking derivative if you look at, 
say, limit derivative x 
approaches infinity, thats limit 
this quantity, is one, limit 
derivative x approaches minus 
infinity is negative one you see 
this visibly graph function 
if you plug in a really big number 
look tangent line there, that 
tangent line slope close to one and, 
if you plug in areally negative number 
look tangent line there, that 
tangent line slope close to minus one 
derivative rules revealing facts 
that hidden this function looks like 
got a sharp corner, we know, 
applying differentiation rules, 
using change rule, that this function 
is in fact differentiable we know 
that if we zoom in close enough, thing 
looks like a straight line, derivative 
rules really revealing this structure 
small scales
