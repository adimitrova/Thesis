1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,082
, In our quest for a function which with
it's own derivative, we met e to the x.

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:11,523
Remember, the derivative of e to the x is
e to the x. What's the inverse function

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:17,492
for e to the x? What function undoes that
sort of exponentiation? Well, we really

4
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:23,235
don't have a name for that function yet,
so we're just going to call it Log.

5
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,486
So in symbols, if e to the x is equal to
y, then log y equals x, right?

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,685
Log is the inverse function for e to the,
the log of something I must raise e to get

7
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:42,941
back the thing I plugged into log. These
logs or logarithms are super important for

8
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:49,052
a ton of reasons. Take a look at this.
Since e to the x plus y is e to the x

9
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:55,348
times e to y, right? This is the property
of exponents, if you like. There's a

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,970
corresponding statement about log. Log of
a times b is log of a plus log of b. Or, a

11
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:08,308
shorthand way to say that is that
logarithms transform products into sums.

12
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:14,332
This is a big reason why we care so much
about logs. Once we've got this new

13
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:20,344
function, log, we can ask what's the
derivative of log? So, if f of x is e to

14
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:27,418
the x, the inverse function is log.
If I want to now differentiate log, I can

15
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:35,230
use the inverse function theorem. So, the
derivative of the inverse function is 1

16
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:42,743
over the derivative of the original
function evaluated at the inverse function

17
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:49,026
of x. Now, the neat thing here is that the
derivative of e to the x is itself. So, f

18
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:55,293
prime is just f, and I'm left with f of f
inverse of x. It's e to the log of x. But

19
00:01:55,744 --> 00:02:01,949
log of x tells me what I have to plug into
e to get out the input, right? f of the

20
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:06,886
inverse function of f is just, it would be
the, the same input again. So, this is 1

21
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:12,649
over x. So, the derivative of log x is
just 1 over x. And you can really see this

22
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:17,685
fact on the graph. Here's a graph of y
equals log x. And I should warn you right

23
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:22,671
off the bat that the x-axis and the y-axis
have totally different scales. The x-axis

24
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:28,023
goes from 1 to 100. The y-axis in this
plot goes from 0 to 5. it's going to make

25
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:33,322
it not so easy to tell the exact values of
the slopes and tangent lines, but you can

26
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:38,188
see from this graph the important
qualitative feature. That the graph is

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,836
getting less and less slopey. And if you
like, it's flattening out as the input

28
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:49,665
gets bigger. if I put down a tangent line
and I start moving the point that I'm

29
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:54,335
taking the tangent line at to the right,
you can see the tangent line slope is

30
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:59,095
getting closer and closer to zero. And, of
course, that's reflected by knowing the

31
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:03,915
derivative of log x is 1 over x. So, if x
is really big, the tangent line at x is

32
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:09,617
really close to zero in slope. Think about
log of a really big number. For instance,

33
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:14,973
what's log of a million? A log of a
million is about 13.815510. And, of

34
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:20,690
course, it keeps going. I, it's an
irrational number. But, now the derivative

35
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:26,205
of log, right? Is 1 over its input. So,
what does that tell you that you might

36
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:31,723
think log of a million and 1 is equal to?
Well, the derivative tells you how much

37
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:37,308
wiggling input affects the output. So, if
I wiggle the input by 1, you expect the

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,972
output to change by about the derivative.
And yeah, log of a million and 1 is about

39
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:48,902
13.815511, right? What's being affected
here is in the millionths place after the

40
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:54,569
decimal point, right? It's the 6th digit
after the decimal point because it's being

41
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,145
affected like a change of 1 over a
million. All right? I'm changing the

42
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:04,178
output by about a millionth. At this
point, we can also handle logs with other

43
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,092
bases. So, let's suppose I want to
differentiate log of x base b, right? This

44
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:14,153
is the number that I'd raise b to, to get
back x. Well, there's a change of base

45
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:20,034
formula for log. This is the same as the
derivative of, say, the natural log of x

46
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:26,019
over the log of b. But the log of b is a
constant, and the derivative of a constant

47
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:31,938
multiple is just that constant multiple
times the derivative. So, this is 1 over

48
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,428
log b times the derivative of, here's a
natural log of x. But I know the

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,518
derivative of the natural log of x, it's 1
over x.

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,948
So, the derivative of log of x base b is 1
over log b times 1 over x. Or maybe

51
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,951
another way to write this would be 1 over
x times log b, if you prefer writing it

52
00:04:54,963 --> 00:05:00,778
that way. e to the x is a sort of key that
unlocks how to understand the derivative

53
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,991
of a ton of other exponential functions.
For example, now that we know how to

54
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:11,035
differentiate e to the x, we can also
differentiate 2 to the x. So, let's

55
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:16,023
suppose I want to differentiate 2 to the
x. Now, you might just memorize some

56
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:21,677
formula for differentiating this. But it's
easier, I think better, to just recreate

57
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,590
this function out of the functions that
you already know all the derivatives of.

58
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:32,082
So, in this case, let's replace 2 by e to
the log 2 to the x, right? So, instead of

59
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:37,294
writing 2 here, I've just written e to the
log 2, this is just 2. But I've got e to

60
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:42,383
the log 2 to the x and that's the same as
e to the log 2 times x. You know, this is

61
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:47,272
a composition of functions that I know how
to differentiate. I know how to

62
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:52,580
differentiate e to the, and I know how to
differentiate constant multiple times x.

63
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:57,789
So, by the chain rule, it's the derivative
of the outside function. So, which is

64
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:02,221
itself, e to the, at the inside function,
which is log 2 times x, times the

65
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:07,423
derivative of the inside function which in
this case is log 2 log x. So, I'm just

66
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:12,635
going to multiply by log 2. Now, I could
kind of make this look a little bit nicer,

67
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:18,195
right? e to the log 2 times x, well,
that's just 2 to the x times, again log 2.

68
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:23,330
So, the derivative of 2 to the x is 2 to
the x times log 2. And, of course, 2

69
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:29,170
didn't play any significant role here. I
could have replaced 2 by any other number

70
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:34,695
and I'd get the same kind of formula. What
I hope you're seeing is that all of the

71
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:39,879
derivative laws are connected. With
practice, you'll be able to differentiate

72
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:45,088
any function that you build by combining
our standard library of functions and

73
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,112
operations on those functions.
