, i often want to differentiate an inverse 
function say, ive got a function f 
derivative f encodes wiggling 
input affects output derivative 
inverse function would encode 
changes to output affect input 
heres a theorem that i use to handle 
this situation here is inverse 
function theorem im going to suppose 
that f is differentiable function, f 
prime is continuous, derivative is 
continuous derivative, 
point, a, is nonzero in that case, i get 
following fantastic conclusion 
inverse function y is defined 
values y near f a so, function 
f is invertable near a inverse 
function is differentiable inputs near 
f a that derivative is continuous 
in inputs near f a ive even 
got a formula derivative 
derivative inverse function y is 
original derivative, 
derivative original function, 
evaluated inverse function y 
i justify a result like that 
something like that true one 
way to think this is geometrically 
here, ive drawn graph 
made function, y equals f x whats 
graph inverse function look 
like well, one way to think this is 
that inverse function exchanges 
roles x y axes, is 
flipping over, alright 
yaxis now, xaxis, what, 
xaxis is yaxis this 
graph here is y equals f inverse x 
this is you graph inverse 
function alright 
so, lets go back to original function 
if i put a tangent line to 
curve point, lets say that 
tangent line slope m well, whats 
tangent line inverse function that 
would derivative inverse 
function well, if i flip graph 
to look graph inverse 
function, i put a tangent line to 
to inverse function that 
slo pe m if m original 
slope tangent line to original 
function, m is new slope to 
tangent line inverse function 
m well, that makes sense i 
got this graph exchanging roles 
x yaxis, flipping paper 
that exchange is rise run, 
run rise so, slope becomes 
reciprocal old slope this 
slope business is reflected in 
notation, dy dx som lets suppose that y 
is f x, so x is f inverse y, 
supposing that this is an invariable 
function if y is f x, f prime 
x could written dy dx if f is 
inverse y, derivative 
inverse function y, well, thats asking 
hows changing y change x could write that 
dx dy well, if you really take 
this notation seriously, looks 
like saying, is that, dx dy, is 
derivative inverse function, 
dy dx, right 
derivative inverse function is 
derivative original 
function you to think 
derivatives 
computed so, maybe you believe that dx dy 
is dy dx, makes sense that if 
you exchange roles x y, that 
takes reciprocal slope 
line is this wiggling 
happening, right dy dx is measuring 
wiggling x affects y wiggling around 
well, lets suppose that im 
wiggling around a so, im really 
calculating dy dx x, say, is a 
this is quantity that records 
wiggling x near a will affect y well 
then, wheres y wiggling well, if x is 
wiggling around a, y is wiggling around f 
a so, derivative this side is 
really calculated y equals f 
a really necessary to keep track 
this wiggling is happening in 
order to get a valid formula 
actually easier to think whats 
going if we phrase in 
terms chain rule so, i 
know inverse function well, 
heres f inve rse 
f f inverse x is x alright, 
is inverse function whatever 
you plug inverse function, 
outputs whatever you need to plug f 
to get thing you plugged 
inverse function alright so, this is 
true now, if i differentiate sides, 
assuming that f f inverse 
differentiable, chain rule, 
i get well, derivative 
this composition is derivative 
outside inside times derivative 
inside thats equal to 
derivative side, is 
derivative x is now, ill 
divide sides f prime f inverse 
x i get that derivative 
inverse function x is f prime 
f inverse x is that a proof 
absolutely embarrassing truth is 
that this argument assumes 
differentiability inverse function 
if this function, f inverse, is 
differentiable, chain rule 
applied to chain rule requires 
that functions differentiable now, 
if function is differentiable, 
this chain rule calculation tells that 
derivative inverse function is this 
quantity thats predicated 
knowing that inverse function is 
differentiable we know that well, 
thats actually content this 
theorem, right content inverse 
function theorem is really 
calculation derivative 
inverse function really 
fact that inverse function is 
differentiable that is a huge 
deal, something that we 
get chain rule we know 
that inverse function is 
differentiable, chain rule gives 
us this calculation actually 
verifying if inverse function is 
differentiable is really quite deep, 
thats inverse function theorem is 
a big deal chain rule requires 
that functions im applying change 
rule to differentiable in contrast, 
inverse function theorem is asserting 
differenti ability inverse 
function really saying much more, 
a computation derivative 
if derivative exists actually 
telling that derivative exists im 
going to to punt saying much 
proof inverse function 
theorem nevertheless, we 
apply inverse function theorem to 
concrete examples example think 
function, f x equals x squared 
well, whats inverse function to this 
lets suppose domain is 
nonnegative real numbers 
then, functions invertible 
domain, we know name 
inverse is square root x whats 
derivative original function 
well, we know that x, 
derivative is continuous 
derivative is provided that x is a 
positive this is stuff that we 
need to apply inverse function 
theorem then, we know that derivative 
inverse function x is 
original derivative inverse x 
now, inverse fuction is square 
root x, so thats f prime 
square root x, whats f prime f 
prime is function that doubles 
input so, thats square roots 
x so, derivative inverse 
function, derivative square 
root function is square roots 
x, provided x is bigger , right 
like before, this is a calculation 
derivative square root 
function we also see this 
numerically so, square root , 
is , you might ask you 
to take square root of, to get 
say, numeric example 
well, think functions that 
involved here theres squaring 
function square root function we 
saw derivative square root 
function is square root x 
derivative x squared, we already know, 
is x we evaluating 
functions well, im evaluating square 
root function ,, right this is 
x equals , if i evaluate that 
,, thats times 
square root ,, thats 
i evaluating function, 
x squared function well there, im 
really thinking input, so 
ill evaluate that derivative 
x, x is a is 
surprising, right, that 
reciprocals other, 
im calculating derivatives a function 
inverse function 
appropriate places now, lets try to 
answer original question im trying 
to figure out, i to take 
square root to get well, 
ratio here is between 
input output so, if i want 
output to affected , i try 
to change input times 
much, times is , so i 
try to change input 
sure enough, if you take square root 
,, thats awfully close to a 
i hope that youll play around 
numbers conceptual stuff 
that doing, theorems, im 
telling you theorems to make numbers 
boring, right im telling you 
theorems to heighten appreciation 
numerical examples
