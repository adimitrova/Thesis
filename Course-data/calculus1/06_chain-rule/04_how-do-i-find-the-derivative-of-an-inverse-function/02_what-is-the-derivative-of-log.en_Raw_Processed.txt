, in quest a function 
derivative, we met e to x 
remember, derivative e to x is 
e to x whats inverse function 
e to x function undoes that 
sort exponentiation well, we really 
dont a name that function yet, 
so going to call log 
so in symbols, if e to x is equal to 
y, log y equals x, right 
log is inverse function e to the, 
log something i must raise e to get 
back thing i plugged log 
logs logarithms super important 
a ton reasons take a look this 
since e to x plus y is e to x 
times e to y, right this is property 
exponents, if you like theres a 
corresponding statement log log 
a times b is log a plus log b or, a 
shorthand way to say that is that 
logarithms transform products sums 
this is a big reason we care so much 
logs weve got this new 
function, log, we ask whats 
derivative log so, if f x is e to 
x, inverse function is log 
if i want to differentiate log, i 
use inverse function theorem so, 
derivative inverse function is 
derivative original 
function evaluated inverse function 
x now, neat thing here is that 
derivative e to x is so, f 
prime is f, im left f f 
inverse x e to log x 
log x tells i to plug 
e to get input, right f 
inverse function f is just, would 
the, input so, this is 
x so, derivative log x is 
x you really see this 
fact graph heres a graph y 
equals log x i warn you right 
bat that xaxis yaxis 
totally different scales xaxis 
goes to yaxis in this 
plot goes to going to make 
so easy to tell exact values 
slopes tangent lines, you 
see this graph important 
qualitative feature that graph is 
getting less less slopey if you 
like, flattening input 
gets bigger if i put a tangent line 
i start moving point that im 
taking tangent line to right, 
you see tangent line slope is 
getting closer closer to zero and, 
course, thats reflected knowing 
derivative log x is x so, if x 
is really big, tangent line x is 
really close to zero in slope think 
log a really big number instance, 
whats log a million a log a 
million is and, 
course, keeps going i, an 
irrational number but, derivative 
log, right is input so, 
that tell you that you might 
think log a million is equal to 
well, derivative tells you much 
wiggling input affects output so, if 
i wiggle input , you expect 
output to change derivative 
yeah, log a million is 
, right whats affected 
here is in millionths place 
decimal point, right th digit 
decimal point 
affected like a change a 
million right im changing 
output a millionth this 
point, we also handle logs 
bases so, lets suppose i want to 
differentiate log x base b, right this 
is number that id raise b to, to get 
back x well, theres a change base 
formula log this is 
derivative of, say, natural log x 
log b log b is a 
constant, derivative a constant 
multiple is that constant multiple 
times derivative so, this is 
log b times derivative of, heres a 
natural log x i know 
derivative natural log x, 
x 
so, derivative log x base b is 
log b times x maybe 
another way to write this would 
x times log b, if you prefer writing 
that way e to x is a sort key that 
unlocks to understand derivative 
a ton exponential functions 
example, that we know to 
differentiate e to x, we also 
differentiate to x so, lets 
suppose i want to differentiate to 
x now, you might memorize 
formula differentiating this 
easier, i think better, to recreate 
this function functions that 
you already know derivatives 
so, in this case, lets replace e to 
log to x, right so, instead 
writing here, ive written e to 
log , this is ive got e to 
log to x thats 
e to log times x you know, this is 
a composition functions that i know 
to differentiate i know to 
differentiate e to the, i know to 
differentiate constant multiple times x 
so, chain rule, derivative 
outside function so, is 
itself, e to the, inside function, 
is log times x, times 
derivative inside function in 
this case is log log x so, im 
going to multiply log now, i could 
kind make this look a little bit nicer, 
right e to log times x, well, 
thats to x times, log 
so, derivative to x is to 
x times log and, course, 
didnt play significant role here i 
could replaced number 
id get kind formula 
i hope youre seeing is that 
derivative laws connected 
practice, youll able to differentiate 
function that you build combining 
standard library functions 
operations functions
