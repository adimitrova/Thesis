,, i cook really nasty 
functions, give to you ask 
you to differentiate instance, i 
could ask you to differentiate this 
function plus x squared to th 
power, plus x cubed to th power, 
divided plus x to fourth, 
this to seventh power in principle, 
theres nothing stopping you plowing 
ahead computing derivative you 
totally differentiate this function 
right whats derivative this 
function well, this functions a quotient 
so needs quotient rule 
denominator quotient rule is 
original denominator squared so 
going to original denominator 
to th power quotient rule, 
numerator starts 
derivative original numerator now, 
original numerator is a product so 
ill able to this derivative 
using the, product rule chain rule so 
derivative numerator imes 
denominator keeps going, 
right i gotta subtract the, 
derivative denominator times 
numerator but, look, you this 
derivative careful application 
quotient rule, product rule, 
power rule, chain rule there is 
one thing stopping you, sense 
human decency an awful 
calculation nobody would want to that 
so instead, i propose a trick maybe 
a trick, a trick 
that fits a general theme 
logarithms logarithms turn exponentiation 
multiplication, multiplication 
addition lets see this helps 
us so here we go instead calling this 
function f x im jut going to call 
y, im getting ready to a sort 
implicit differentiation im going to 
first apply log to sides this 
ill get log y whats log 
side well log a quotient, 
is a difference logs, logs 
things to powers, is that power 
times log base so this works 
to times log plus x squared plus 
this log turns multiplication 
addition times log plus x cubed 
this quotient becomes a difference, 
so, minus in exponent, log 
plus x now, we differentiate right, 
so differentiating now, whats 
derivative log y remember, y is 
secretly a function x, so i 
differentiate log y derivative 
outside, is y, times 
derivative inside, which, ill 
write dy dx this is really an example if 
you like implicit differentiation 
alright, i differentiate 
side, , i multiply 
derivative log is over, so 
inside function plus x squared times 
derivative inside function 
is x derivative plus x 
squared is x right, plus , 
derivative log is inside 
function, plus x cubed, times 
derivative this inside function, 
is times x squared, minus over, 
derivative log is one 
inside function, one plus x to fourth, 
derivative one plus x to 
fourth is four x cubed almost 
there so now, i multiply sides 
y i get that derivative is 
this thing calculated x y, y is this 
quantity i write this a little bit 
nicely alright heres this times x 
is x, times is , times is , 
i multiply y so i found 
derivative, here is in general, this 
trick logarithmic differentiation 
called, works fantastically well 
functions like rational functions 
that involve a lot high powers
