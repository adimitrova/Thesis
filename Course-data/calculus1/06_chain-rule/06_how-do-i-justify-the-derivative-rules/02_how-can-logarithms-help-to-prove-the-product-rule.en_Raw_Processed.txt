, remember back before, we talked 
product rule you know, goes 
like derivative f times g is 
derivative f times g plus f times 
derivative g a little bit 
mysterious considering that product 
rule a plus in we proved this 
previously, going back to 
definition derivative in terms 
limit and, calculating necessary 
limit to show that, this product rule 
in fact valid weve already seen a proof 
products rule originally we 
justified product rule going back 
to limit definition derivative 
manipulating that limit maybe that 
proof didnt speak to you, so theres 
another trick that we use we use 
logarithms to replace product a 
sum lets see so lets suppose that 
f x is bigger , g x is 
bigger , say x i want 
to this positive functions okay 
im going to use logs, so lets take 
log f x times g x 
i know logs logs turn products 
sums so log f x times g 
x is log f x plus log g 
x im going to differentiate 
sides this equation so derivative 
log is over, chain rule, 
thats inside function times 
derivative inside function, 
in this case is derivative f 
x times g x thats id like to 
compute whats driv 
side well derivative log is 
over, so inside function times 
derivative inside function, 
plus log g x is inside 
function times derivative 
inside function if i multiply 
sides f x times g x, 
happens well if i multiply this side f 
x times g x, ive isolated 
derivative product so this is 
derivative f x times g x if 
i multiply this side f x times g 
x, f x times f x is , 
im left a factor g x times 
f prime x plus, if i multiply this 
term f x times g x, g x times 
g x is one, im left 
an f x, so f x times g prime 
x look, this is product rule 
derivative product is the, in this 
case, g x times f prime x plus f 
x times g prime x so, i mean, 
orders a little bit different, is 
product rule so weve justified 
product rule another way using logarithms, 
that raises a question, whats 
point multiple proofs a 
single mathematical fact if 
different proofs product 
rule makes product rule true 
this argument is in favor is 
that showing a nice trick that 
you logarithms theres a 
theme that products quotients much 
complicated sums differences 
armed logarithms, we convert 
difficult products quotients much 
easier sums differences, thats a 
huge win us
