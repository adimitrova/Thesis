,
how
do
we
prove
the
quotient
rule
?
well
first
,
we
should
remember
what
the
quotient
rule
says
.
so
,
remember
what
the
quotient
rule
says
.
it
says
the
derivative
of
f
over
g
is
the
derivative
of
f
times
g
minus
f
times
the
derivative
of
g
all
over
the
value
of
g.
not
the
derivative
of
g.
just
g
of
x
squared
.
but
we
have
n't
actually
seen
a
proof
of
the
quotient
rule
.
why
should
the
derivative
of
a
quotient
be
governed
by
that
crazy
looking
formula
?
well
,
one
way
to
justify
this
formula
is
to
combine
the
chain
rule
and
the
product
rule
.
so
,
we
're
trying
to
build
our
way
up
to
the
quotient
rule
so
we
can
first
do
the
simplest
possible
case
the
quotient
rule
by
hand
if
you
like
.
what
's
the
derivative
1
over
x
?
well
,
1
over
x
is
just
x
to
the
minus
first
power
.
and
if
i
differentiate
this
,
that
's
the
power
rule
.
we
saw
how
to
do
that
before
.
that
's
minus
1
times
x
to
the
minus
second
power
.
another
way
to
write
this
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
.
now
,
if
you
were
n't
certain
why
the
power
rule
held
,
you
could
also
have
calculated
this
derivative
by
hand
by
going
back
to
the
definition
of
derivative
.
this
is
actually
how
we
justified
the
power
rule
for
negative
exponents
.
this
limit
,
you
can
also
calculate
,
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
.
knowing
how
to
differentiate
1
over
x
is
enough
for
us
to
differentiate
1
over
g
of
x
by
using
the
chain
rule
.
so
,
we
're
going
to
use
the
chain
rule
.
so
,
let
me
first
make
up
a
new
function
that
's
called
f
of
x
at
function
1
over
x.
so
then
f
prime
of
x
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
.
the
derivative
that
we
just
calculated
.
now
,
if
i
wanted
to
calculate
the
derivative
of
1
over
g
of
x.
well
,
that
's
the
same
as
the
derivative
now
of
f
of
g
of
x
,
since
i
defined
f
to
be
the
1
over
function
.
and
by
the
chain
rule
,
the
derivative
of
this
composition
is
the
derivative
of
the
outside
at
the
inside
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
.
the
derivative
of
f
is
minus
1
over
its
input
squared
.
so
,
f
prime
of
g
of
x
is
minus
1
over
g
of
x
squared
.
that
's
looking
good
.
that
's
like
th
e
denominator
of
the
quotient
rule
.
alright
,
times
g
prime
of
x.
so
,
the
derivative
of
1
over
g
of
x
is
minus
1
over
g
of
x
squared
times
the
derivative
of
g.
now
,
i
've
got
the
product
rule
.
so
,
if
i
can
differentiate
f
and
i
can
differentiate
1
over
g
of
x
,
i
can
differentiate
their
product
which
happens
to
be
the
quotient
,
f
of
x
over
g
of
x.
so
,
i
want
to
differentiate
f
of
x
over
g
of
x
,
right
?
i
'm
trying
to
head
towards
the
quotient
rule
.
but
i
'm
going
to
rewrite
this
quotient
as
a
product
.
it
's
the
derivative
of
f
of
x
times
1
over
g
of
x.
now
,
this
is
the
derivative
of
products
so
i
can
apply
the
product
rule
,
which
i
already
know
.
and
that
's
the
derivative
of
the
first
times
the
second
,
plus
the
first
times
the
derivative
of
the
second
.
but
we
calculated
the
derivative
of
the
second
just
a
moment
ago
.
the
derivative
of
1
over
g
of
x
is
minus
1
over
g
of
x
squared
times
g
prime
of
x.
so
,
i
can
put
that
in
here
as
the
derivative
of
1
over
g
of
x.
it
's
minus
1
over
g
of
x
squared
times
g
prime
of
x.
by
rearranging
this
,
i
can
make
this
look
like
the
quotient
rule
that
we
're
used
to
.
let
's
aim
to
put
this
over
a
common
denominator
.
so
,
i
could
write
this
as
f
prime
of
x
times
g
of
x
over
g
of
x
squared
plus
,
what
do
i
have
over
here
?
well
,
negative
f
of
x
g
prime
of
x
,
the
negative
1
f
of
x
g
prime
of
x
,
over
g
of
x
squared
.
and
i
can
combine
these
two
fractions
,
f
prime
of
x
g
of
x
minus
f
of
x
g
prime
of
x
all
over
g
of
x
squared
.
that
's
the
quotient
rule
,
right
?
we
've
got
to
the
quotient
rule
at
this
point
.
and
how
is
it
we
do
it
?
well
,
think
back
to
what
just
happened
.
i
,
i
used
the
power
rule
to
differentiate
1
over
x.
once
i
knew
the
derivative
of
that
,
i
could
use
the
chain
rule
to
differentiate
1
over
g
of
x.
and
once
i
knew
the
derivative
of
1
over
g
of
x
,
i
could
then
use
the
product
rule
on
f
of
x
times
1
over
g
of
x
to
recover
the
quotient
rule
.
what
's
the
upshot
here
?
why
is
it
important
that
the
quotient
rule
can
be
seen
as
an
application
of
the
chain
rule
and
the
product
rule
?
one
reason
is
a
pedagogical
one
.
i
think
it
's
important
for
you
to
see
that
all
these
differentiation
rules
are
connected
together
.
i
hope
that
will
give
you
a
better
sense
of
the
rules
and
,
and
make
them
more
memorable
.
