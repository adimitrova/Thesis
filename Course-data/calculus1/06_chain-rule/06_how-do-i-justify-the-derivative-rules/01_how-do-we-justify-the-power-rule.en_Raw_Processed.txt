, remember back, remember back to 
power rule well, power rules 
say that derivative x to 
n, real number zero, 
derivative x to n is n times x to 
n minus one power rule isnt 
something we made a 
consequence definition 
derivative we know 
actually true well remember, weve 
already worked this n is a 
positive whole number then, 
derivative x to n is limit 
this difference quotient this is 
limit that calculates derivative if n 
is a positive whole number, i expand 
x plus h to n, i get x to 
n plus n x to n minus times h plus 
things lots hs minus x to n 
h now, x to n 
minus x to n cancel, h here 
cancels this h here, im left a 
bunch hs divided h, theres still a 
lot hs in this limit this 
constant, far h is concerned plus a 
thing h is in it, well, this goes to 
zero im left n times x to n 
minus , is derivative x to 
n this is a completely valid 
argument long n is a positive, 
whole number theres plenty 
numbers arent positive, whole 
numbers if n equaled negative 
lets figure derivative x to 
minus first power actually, 
derivative x this is a problem 
that we attack directly using 
definition derivative here, ive 
written limit function x 
plus h minus function h now, to 
calculate this limit, ill first put this 
part in numerator a common 
denominator so, this is limit h 
goes to zero, whole things h 
numerator is x minus x plus h, 
common denominator things in 
numerator, x plus h times x now, 
whats x minus x plus h well, in that 
case, this x this x cancel 
im left is negative h there 
so, this is limit h goes to zero 
negative h x plus h times x 
h great 
now, h here h here 
cancel i left im left 
limit h goes to zero negative 
x plus h times x now, i deal 
this well, h goes to zero, 
numerators denominator is 
approaching x squared so, this limit is 
minus x squared weve 
calculated here is derivative 
x, derivative x is 
negative x squared now, i use 
this fact fact that derivative 
x is negative x squared to 
compute using change rule 
derivative x to n this is a 
composition two functions, 
composition function 
x to n function derivative 
is negative thing squared 
so, derivative outside 
function inside times 
derivative inside function 
derivative x to n, if n says 
positive, whole number, i already know 
this, n times x to n minus 
x to n squared is x to n so, 
ive got negative x to n times 
n times x to n minus now, a minor 
miracle happens x to n x 
to n minus , theyre interacting, so 
that im left x to n plus 
in denominator, minus times integer 
minus n in numerator now, this movie 
doesnt look so great remember that 
x to n is another name 
x to negative nth power this, 
if i rewrote this x to a power, i could 
rewrite this negative n times x to 
negative n minus power look 
weve shown is derivative x to 
negative n is negative n x to 
negative n minus this is verifying 
power rule holds even n is a negative 
number pretty good 
weve done whole numbers 
rational numbers so, 
heres a question derivative 
x to power is times x 
to that power minus , 
implicit di fferentiation to rescue 
well, heres maybe a simpler case y is 
derivative x to 
times x to negative well, lets 
set y equal x to , that means 
y to th power is x i apply 
explicit differentiation to y to 
equals x so differentiation precisely 
gets y to dy dx equals a 
derivative x, is divide 
sides times y to th power 
i get that dy dx is times y to 
th power but, y is x to 
so, dy dx is times y, is 
x to seventeenth x to 
but, that, so i could 
write this times x to negative 
so chain rule finishes 
problem if i want to differentiate x 
to power, well thats 
differentiating x to power to 
st power chain rule so thats 
times inside, x to 
to th thats derivative 
outside function versus st power 
function inside, times 
derivative inside function now, 
good news we calculated derivative 
outside function this is times x 
to to th power times 
derivative x to , is 
x to negative well, this is 
times x to times x to 
negative minus is 
times x to , 
x to thats exactly 
power rule tells you n is 
we started knowing power rule 
true positive whole number 
exponents now, a little 
bit work, we know that power rule 
holds rational exponent 
function f x equals x to 
square root power whoa 
that even mean a serious objection 
i mean a number raised to 
square root power well, i 
i take x i raise to 
power, i mean, i take x 
multiplied times 
take tenth root that i take x 
to power, i mean i take 
x multiplied times, 
take hundredth root that i 
keep going, right 
if i want to take x to power, 
id multiply x , times, 
take thousandth root that if 
i to take x to power, 
right 
i take x multiply , 
times take ,th root 
that number i keep this, 
im getting closer closer to 
square root thats really 
this function means really means to 
take a limit functions i actually 
understand, functions im taking x 
to a rational exponent we handle this 
a logarithm so, lets set y equals x 
to square root power i want to 
calculate dy dx so, trick here is 
log so, im going to take a log 
sides log y is log x to square 
root power log something to a 
power is that power times log base 
so, ive got log y is square root 
times log x now, i differentiate 
sides i find that derivative 
log y is y dy dx, derivative 
side is square root 
times x multiply sides y, 
ive got dy dx is square root 
yx i know y is y is x to 
square root power so, this is 
square root times x to square 
root power divided x in 
words, square root times x 
to square root minus 
using logarithms to fill in gaps in 
quotient rule learning 
a bunch derivative rules, 
actually learning rules work 
take a look square root here 
plays essential role in this argument 
i could go back this entire thing 
replace square root 
everywhere i see number n 
id see is that this logarithm 
argument is justifying power rule 
derivativ e x to n is n times x to 
n, n minus so, really 
building foundations calculus we 
learning to apply 
rules to calculations, learning 
to justify that rules 
correct rules
