, we prove quotient rule well 
first, we remember 
quotient rule says so, remember 
quotient rule says says derivative 
f g is derivative f times g 
minus f times derivative g 
value g derivative g 
g x squared we havent 
actually seen a proof quotient 
rule derivative a 
quotient governed that crazy looking 
formula well, one way to justify this 
formula is to combine chain rule 
product rule so, trying to 
build way to quotient rule so 
we first simplest possible case 
quotient rule hand if you like 
whats derivative x well, 
x is x to minus first power 
if i differentiate this, thats 
power rule we saw to that 
thats minus times x to minus second 
power another way to write this is minus 
x squared now, if you werent 
certain power rule held, you could 
also calculated this derivative 
hand going back to definition 
derivative this is actually we 
justified power rule negative 
exponents this limit, you also 
calculate, is minus x squared 
knowing to differentiate x is 
enough us to differentiate g 
x using chain rule so, going 
to use chain rule so, let first 
make a new function thats called f 
x function x so f prime 
x is minus x squared 
derivative that we calculated now, 
if i wanted to calculate derivative 
g x well, thats 
derivative f g x, since i 
defined f to function 
chain rule, derivative this 
composition is derivative 
outside inside times derivative 
inside derivative f is 
minus input squared so, f 
prime g x is minus g x 
squared thats looking good thats like 
th e denominator quotient rule 
alright, times g prime x so, 
derivative g x is minus 
g x squared times derivative 
g now, ive got product rule so, 
if i differentiate f i 
differentiate g x, i 
differentiate product happens 
to quotient, f x g x 
so, i want to differentiate f x g 
x, right im trying to head towards 
quotient rule im going to 
rewrite this quotient a product 
derivative f x times g 
x now, this is derivative products 
so i apply product rule, i 
already know thats derivative 
first times second, plus first 
times derivative second we 
calculated derivative second 
a moment ago derivative 
g x is minus g x squared 
times g prime x so, i put that in 
here derivative g x 
minus g x squared times g 
prime x rearranging this, i 
make this look like quotient rule that 
used to lets aim to put this 
a common denominator so, i could write 
this f prime x times g x g 
x squared plus, i 
here well, negative f x g prime x, 
negative f x g prime x, g 
x squared i combine two 
fractions, f prime x g x minus f 
x g prime x g x squared 
thats quotient rule, right weve got 
to quotient rule this point 
is we well, think back to 
happened i, i used power 
rule to differentiate x i 
knew derivative that, i could use 
chain rule to differentiate g 
x i knew derivative 
g x, i could use product 
rule f x times g x to 
recover quotient rule whats 
upshot here is important that 
quotient rule seen an 
application chain rule 
product rule one reason is a pedagogical 
one i think important you to see 
that differentiation rules 
connected together i hope that will give 
you a better sense rules and, 
make memorable
