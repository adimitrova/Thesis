, chain rule is so important, 
worth thinking a proof 
validity you might tempted to think 
that you get away 
cancelling i mean is you might 
tempted to think that something like this 
works lets say you wanted to 
differentiate g f x you might set f 
x equal to y then, you might 
think, well, youre really trying to 
calculate is derivative g y 
okay then, you might say, well, 
derivative g y, that will 
derivative g respect to y times 
derivative y respect to x, 
thats really chain rule i mean, this 
first thing is derivative g 
this thing is derivative f 
like youd expect, youre 
trying to say that you cancel, 
alright youre allowed to 
cancel i mean, upshot here is 
that dydx is a fraction, alright you 
cant justify this equality 
canceling objects, way 
youre supposedly canceling, 
theyre fractions we need a 
delicate argument that one way to go 
is to give a slightly different definition 
derivative well, heres a slightly 
different way packaging 
derivative function f is 
differentiable a point a, provided 
theres number, im 
suggestively calling f prime a, if 
derivative f a, so that limit 
this error function is equal to 
whats this error function well, 
measuring far approximation is that 
id get using derivative 
actual functions output if i plug in an 
input value near a in ways, thats 
actually a nicer definition derivative, 
since really conveys that 
derivative provides a way to approximate 
output values functions in case, 
now, lets take this new definition 
derivative try to prove chain 
rule try to approximate g f x plus 
h try to discover chain rules so, i 
want to able to express this in terms 
derivative g f, least, 
approximately, control error 
well, i that f im 
assuming that f is deferential 
point x so, this is g of, instead f 
x plus h, f x plus derivative f 
x times h plus an error term, we 
calling error f h times h im 
going to play game g this 
is g f x plus a small quantity 
if i assume that g is differentiable 
point f x, this is g f x 
plus derivative g f x times 
much i wiggle by, which, in this case, 
is f prime x h plus that error term 
plus an error term g, is 
error term g i to put in 
much i wiggled by, which, in this case, is 
f prime xh plus error term f 
h times h times that quantity, f 
prime xh plus error term f h 
times h alright, so thats exactly equal 
to g f x plus h im including 
error terms now, we expand 
a bit so, this is g f x plus, 
you multiply two terms together, 
g prime f x times f prime xh 
thats looking really good, thats 
chain rule is, right 
supposed to give this derivative 
g composed f plus, ive got a ton 
error terms error terms 
an h, so im going to collect 
hs end first error term is g 
prime f x, this term here, times 
error f h next ones, plus 
error g, this complicated quantity, 
i going to abbreviate hyphen, times f 
prime x times h, im collecting 
hs end, plus error term 
g, that complicated quantity, times 
error f h, that is times 
h alright now, this is almost giving 
derivative composite function 
provided that i control size 
this error term, right i need to 
show is that limit h approches 
this error term is really , 
error term, right, part th 
e times h, g prime f x 
times error term f h plus 
error term g times f prime x, plus 
error term g times error term 
f h now, i know that, that 
limit is equal to well, i in 
pieces, right limit sum, 
so sum limits i know 
that this first term is got 
an error f h term in it, f is 
differentiable, error term goes to 
i likewise know this, 
alright this is, also got an error f 
h term in mysterious term 
is this if you think a little bit 
it, error g this 
hyphen thing, im abbreviating this 
whole thing here, also goes to h goes 
to thats another thing to know 
that limit h goes to this 
quantity is is enough to say 
that g f x plus h equals this 
quantity, actually implies that this is 
derivative so, heres weve 
actually shown suppose that f is 
differentiable a point a g is 
differentiable point f a, 
composite function, g composed f, 
is differentiable a, 
derivative g f point a, equal 
to derivative g f a times 
derivative f a
