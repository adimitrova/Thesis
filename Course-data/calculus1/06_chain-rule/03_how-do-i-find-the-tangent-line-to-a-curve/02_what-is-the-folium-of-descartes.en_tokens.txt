,
the
folium
of
descartes
is
an
algebraic
curve
carved
out
by
a
certain
equation
.
by
which
equation
?
this
equation
,
x
cubed
plus
y
cubed
minus
3axy
equals
0.
it
's
the
points
on
the
plane
that
satisfy
this
equation
.
so
,
what
's
a
folium
?
well
,
folium
is
just
a
latin
word
for
leaf
,
you
know
,
the
sorts
of
things
that
grow
on
trees
.
so
,
where
's
the
leaf
?
well
,
here
's
the
leaf
.
i
've
plotted
the
points
on
the
plane
that
satisfy
x
cubed
plus
y
cubed
minus
9xy
equals
0.
and
this
is
the
curve
that
i
get
,
and
you
can
see
it
looks
kind
of
like
a
leaf
.
this
is
not
the
graph
of
a
function
,
it
's
really
a
relation
.
x
cubed
plus
y
cubed
minus
9xy
is
a
polynomial
in
two
variables
,
in
both
x
and
y
,
in
both
.
i
ca
n't
solve
for
x
in
terms
of
y.
look
,
this
graph
fails
the
vertical
line
test
.
for
a
given
value
of
x
,
there
's
potentially
multiple
values
of
y
which
will
satisfy
this
equation
.
so
,
what
's
the
point
of
all
these
?
well
,
once
upon
a
time
,
descartes
challenged
fermat
to
find
the
tangent
line
to
this
folium
.
and
descartes
could
n't
do
it
but
fermat
could
.
and
now
,
so
can
you
.
and
you
can
do
it
with
implicit
differentiation
.
so
,
let
's
use
implicit
differentiation
on
this
,
thinking
of
y
secretly
as
a
function
of
x.
so
,
the
derivative
of
x
cubed
is
3x
squared
.
the
derivative
of
y
cubed
,
well
,
that
's
3y
squared
times
dy
dx
,
that
's
really
the
chain
rule
in
action
,
minus
,
now
it
's
got
to
differentiate
this
.
it
will
be
9
times
the
derivative
x
,
which
is
1y
minus
9x
times
the
derivative
of
y
,
which
is
dy
dx
,
and
that
's
equal
to
0.
alright
,
now
i
can
rearrange
this
,
the
things
with
the
dy
dx
,
and
the
things
without
the
dy
dx
,
and
you
gather
it
together
.
so
,
3x
squared
minus
9y
plus
,
and
the
things
with
the
dy
dx
term
,
3y
squared
minus
9x
dy
dx
equals
0.
now
,
i
'm
going
to
subtract
this
from
both
sides
.
so
,
i
'll
have
3y
squared
minus
9x
times
dy
dx
equals
minus
3x
squared
plus
9y
.
and
i
'm
going
to
divide
both
sides
by
this
,
so
i
'll
have
dy
dx
equals
minus
3x
squared
plus
9y
over
3y
squared
minus
9x
.
and
note
that
we
're
calculating
dy
dx
but
the
answer
involves
both
x
and
y.
and
you
can
see
,
it
's
really
working
.
i
can
pick
a
point
on
this
curve
like
a
point
4
,
2
satisfies
this
equation
.
then
,
i
can
ask
what
's
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
to
the
curve
through
the
point
4
,
2
?
when
i
go
back
to
our
calculation
of
the
derivative
and
if
i
plug
in
4
for
x
and
2
for
y
,
i
get
that
the
derivative
is
4/5
.
and
indeed
,
i
mean
,
this
graph
is
somewhat
stretched
,
but
,
you
know
,
yeah
,
i
mean
that
does
n't
look
terribly
unreasonable
for
the
slope
of
this
line
.
problems
like
this
one
,
which
once
stumped
the
smartest
people
on
earth
can
now
be
answered
by
you
,
by
me
,
by
lots
and
lots
of
people
.
calculus
is
part
of
a
human
tradition
of
making
not
just
impossible
things
possible
,
but
things
that
were
once
really
hard
much
easier
.
well
,
in
any
case
,
there
's
plenty
more
questions
that
you
can
just
ask
about
different
kinds
of
curves
besides
this
folium
of
descartes
.
you
can
write
down
some
polynomial
with
x
's
and
y
's
,
like
y
squared
minus
x
cubed
minus
3x
squared
equals
=
0
and
then
you
can
ask
about
the
points
,
the
x
comma
y
's
that
satisfy
this
equation
.
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
,
use
implicit
differentiation
.
the
trick
is
just
to
use
the
chain
rule
and
to
treat
y
as
a
function
of
x
.
