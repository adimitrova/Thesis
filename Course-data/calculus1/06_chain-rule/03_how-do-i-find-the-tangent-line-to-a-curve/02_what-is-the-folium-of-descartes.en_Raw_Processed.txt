, folium descartes is an algebraic 
curve carved a certain equation 
equation this equation, x cubed 
plus y cubed minus axy equals 
points plane that satisfy this 
equation 
so, whats a folium well, folium is 
a latin word leaf, you know, sorts 
things that grow trees so, wheres 
leaf well, heres leaf ive 
plotted points plane that 
satisfy x cubed plus y cubed minus xy 
equals this is curve that i 
get, you see looks kind like 
a leaf this is graph a 
function, really a relation x cubed 
plus y cubed minus xy is a polynomial in 
two variables, in x y, in i 
cant solve x in terms y look, 
this graph fails vertical line test 
a given value x, theres 
potentially multiple values y 
will satisfy this equation so, whats 
point well, upon a 
time, descartes challenged fermat to find 
tangent line to this folium 
descartes couldnt fermat could 
now, so you you 
implicit differentiation so, lets 
use implicit differentiation this, 
thinking y secretly a function x 
so, derivative x cubed is x 
squared derivative y cubed, well, 
thats y squared times dy dx, thats 
really chain rule in action, minus, 
got to differentiate this 
will times derivative x, is 
y minus x times derivative y, 
is dy dx, thats equal to 
alright, i rearrange this, 
things dy dx, things 
without dy dx, you gather 
together so, x squared minus y plus, 
things dy dx term, y 
squared minus x dy dx equals now, im 
going to subtract this sides 
so, ill y squared minus x times dy 
dx equals minus x squared plus y 
im going to divide sides this, so 
ill dy dx equals minus x squared 
plus y y squared minus x note 
that calculating dy dx 
answer involves x y you 
see, really working i pick a 
point this curve like a point , 
satisfies this equation then, i ask 
whats slope tangent line to 
curve point , i 
go back to calculation 
derivative if i plug in x 
y, i get that derivative is 
indeed, i mean, this graph is somewhat 
stretched, but, you know, yeah, i mean 
that doesnt look terribly unreasonable 
slope this line problems like 
this one, stumped smartest 
people earth answered 
you, me, lots lots people 
calculus is part a human tradition 
making impossible things 
possible, things that really 
hard much easier 
well, in case, theres plenty 
questions that you ask 
different kinds curves besides this 
folium descartes you write 
polynomial xs ys, like y 
squared minus x cubed minus x squared 
equals you ask 
points, x comma ys that satisfy this 
equation 
if you want to know slope 
tangent line, use implicit 
differentiation trick is to use 
chain rule to treat y a 
function x
