, sometimes you dont a function, you 
a relation between two variables a 
classic example is x squared plus y 
squared equals, say, graph 
points in plane that satisfy this 
equation a circle thats 
graph a function, right this graph 
fails vertical line test a given 
input value, say in this case, theres 
multiple y values satisfy this 
equation so, i cant simply solve this 
equation y nevertheless, if you pick 
a specific point like , , you might 
able to find a function whose graph traces 
that curve so yeah, if i pick , 
, there is a function, y equals 
square minus x squared traces 
a piece whole curve, right im 
ignoring rest this this 
little tiny piece curve 
regarded a function if i picked a 
different point, im going to pick a 
different function instead square 
root minus x squared, if i wanted to 
stand here, near point , minus 
, well maybe id pick function y 
equals negative square root 
minus x squared if i ignore rest 
this im looking this curve 
here, yet this curve is a 
function if i ignore this, satisfies 
vertical line test this function is 
picking a piece curve given 
this equation is, yeah, valid 
near point , minus maybe 
thats i care time 
so, lets say there is a function, 
y equals f x, that satisfies 
original equation well then, i write 
that y equald f x say satisfies 
equation means that x squared 
plus f x squared equals now, im 
saying that this gives 
solutions, right graph x squared plus 
y squared equals is a circle fails 
vertical line test there is function 
that gives outputs 
theres multiple outputs a given 
input im saying is that ive got 
function traces a piece 
whole curve then, i 
differentiate so, this is true a 
bunch values x that i 
differentiate this derivative this 
sum is sum derivative, so 
derivative x squared is x plus 
derivative f x squared im going to 
use a chain rule to that 
derivative outside function 
inside times derivative inside 
function equals derivative , 
is zero i solve so, 
subtract x sides im left 
times f x times f prime x 
equals negative x then, ill divide 
sides times f x ill 
find that f prime x is minus x 
f x, i cancel 
get minus x f x seems 
like a funny situation derivative 
depends x also 
an f x in 
another way to say is that slope 
tangent line dy, dx, is negative x 
y, right y is f x 
really seem a littie bit putting 
initially in kinds calculations 
slope tangent line depends 
x negative x y 
this particular case think back 
to piacture this case, right 
pictures a circle im 
saying is slope tangent line is 
negative x y so, if you pick that 
point, say ,, you ask whats 
slope tangent line to circle 
point , this equation is telling you 
slope is thirds yeah, that 
line is going down, slopes negative 
whats slope tangent line to 
curve point , negative 
equation tells us that slope there is 
rds yeah, this lines going 
slope tangent line is depending 
x coordinate, right 
you also need to know y coordinate in 
order to know exactly function youre 
actually looking near that point 
that totally affects slope that 
tangent line to sorts 
calculations, trick is cha in 
rule 
instance, if youre given 
relation like this, x squared plus y cubed 
equals you got to make sure to 
think y a function x so that 
you differentiate sides, 
derivative left hand side is x 
plus derivative y cubed equals 
derivative , is , whats 
derivative y cubed if y is a 
function x, you differentiate 
this, youve got to use chain rule 
times inside function squared, 
thats derivative third power 
function, times derivative 
inside function ill write y prime 
long youre careful to use 
chain rule, youll able to 
kinds implicit differentiation 
problems youll eventually solve 
y prime in terms x y 
chain rule is friend
