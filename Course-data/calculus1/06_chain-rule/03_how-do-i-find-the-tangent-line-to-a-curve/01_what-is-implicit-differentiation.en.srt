1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,144
, Sometimes you don't have a function, you
have a relation between two variables. A

2
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:17,120
classic example is x squared plus y
squared equals, say, 25. The graph of the

3
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:23,024
points in the plane that satisfy this
equation as a circle. But that's not the

4
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:29,433
graph of a function, right? This graph
fails the vertical line test. For a given

5
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:35,337
input value, say 4 in this case, there's
multiple y values which satisfy this

6
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:41,727
equation. So, I can't simply solve this
equation for y. Nevertheless, if you pick

7
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:48,299
a specific point like 4, 3, you might be
able to find a function whose graph traces

8
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:54,350
out that same curve. So yeah, if I pick 4,
3, there is a function, y equals the

9
00:00:54,362 --> 00:01:00,800
square of 25 minus x squared. Which traces
out a piece of the whole curve, right? I'm

10
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:06,222
just ignoring the rest of this and this
little tiny piece of the curve can be

11
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:11,833
regarded as a function. If I had picked a
different point, then I'm going to pick a

12
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:16,906
different function. Instead of the square
root of 25 minus x squared, if I wanted to

13
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:21,870
stand down here, near the point 4, minus
3, well then maybe I'd pick the function y

14
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:26,794
equals negative the square root of 25
minus x squared. If I ignore the rest of

15
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:31,899
this and I'm just looking at this curve
here, yet this curve by itself is a

16
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:37,628
function. If I ignore this, it satisfies
the vertical line test. This function is

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,201
picking out a piece of the curve given by
this equation which is, yeah, only valid

18
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:48,600
near the point 4, minus 3. But maybe
that's all I care about for the time

19
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:52,850
being. So, let's say there is a function,
y equals f of x, that satisfies the

20
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:57,520
original equation. Well then, I can write
that down. y equald f of x say satisfies

21
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:00,925
the equation just means that x squared
plus f of x squared equals 25. Now, I'm

22
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:05,550
not saying that this gives me all of the
solutions, right? The graph x squared plus

23
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:09,940
y squared equals 25 is a circle fails the
vertical line test. There is no function

24
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:14,745
that gives me all those outputs because
there's multiple outputs for a given

25
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:20,119
input. All I'm saying is that I've got
some function which traces out a piece of

26
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,446
the whole curve. Then, I can
differentiate. So, this is true for a

27
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:29,457
bunch of values of x that I can
differentiate this. The derivative of this

28
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,796
sum is the sum of the derivative, so the
derivative of x squared is 2x plus the

29
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:40,058
derivative of f of x squared. I'm going to
use a chain rule to do that. It's the

30
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,731
derivative of the outside function at the
inside times the derivative of the inside

31
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:52,232
function equals the derivative of 25,
which is zero. Now I can solve. So,

32
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:57,927
subtract 2x from both sides and I'm left
with 2 times f of x times f prime of x

33
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,745
equals negative 2x. And then, I'll divide
both sides by 2 times f of x. And I'll

34
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:09,913
find that f prime of x is minus 2x over 2
f of x, and I can cancel those 2's and

35
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:17,431
just get minus x over f of x. It seems
like a funny situation. The derivative

36
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:22,863
depends on more than just x. It also has
an f of x. in it.

37
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:27,804
Another way to say it is that the slope of
the tangent line dy, dx, is negative x

38
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:32,422
over y, right? y is f of x. And it does
really seem a littie bit off putting

39
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:37,600
initially in these kinds of calculations
the slope of the tangent line depends on

40
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:42,736
more than just x. It's negative x over y
for this particular case. But think back

41
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:47,440
to the piacture for this case, right?
The picture's a circle. And what I'm

42
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:51,595
saying is the slope of the tangent line is
negative x over y. So, if you pick that

43
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:56,295
point, say 4,3, and you ask what's the
slope of the tangent line to the circle at

44
00:03:56,307 --> 00:04:00,815
the point 4,3 this equation is telling you
the slope is -4 thirds. And yeah, that

45
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:07,420
line is going down, the slope's negative.
What's the slope of the tangent line to

46
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:13,675
the curve at the point 4, negative 3? Same
equation tells us that the slope there is

47
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:19,110
4 3rds. And yeah, this line's going up.
The slope of the tangent line is depending

48
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:23,665
on more than just the x coordinate, right?
You also need to know the y coordinate in

49
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:28,275
order to know exactly what function you're
actually looking at near that point. And

50
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,566
that totally affects the slope of that
tangent line. To do all these sorts of

51
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:35,100
calculations, the trick is the cha in
rule.

52
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:39,591
For instance, if you're given some
relation like this, x squared plus y cubed

53
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:43,867
equals 1. You just got to make sure to
think of y as a function of x. So that

54
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,735
when you differentiate both sides, the
derivative of the left hand side is 2x

55
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:54,035
plus the derivative of y cubed equals the
derivative of 1, which is 0, but what's

56
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:59,285
the derivative of y cubed? If y is a
function of x, then when you differentiate

57
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:04,545
this, you've got to use the chain rule.
It's 3 times the inside function squared,

58
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:09,515
that's the derivative of the third power
function, times the derivative of the

59
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:14,655
inside function. I'll just write y prime.
And as long as you're careful to use the

60
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:19,250
chain rule, you'll be able to do these
kinds of implicit differentiation

61
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:24,180
problems. And you'll eventually solve for
y prime in terms of both x and y. The

62
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,705
chain rule is our friend.
