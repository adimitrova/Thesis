[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:09,170
We've been spending a ton of time on
derivatives.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,050
And at this point, you might be asking
yourself, is there

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,180
anything more to do with derivatives, and
the good news is, yes.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,810
There's a lot more to see.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,010
Right now I want to look at the chain
rule.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,500
The chain rule tells us how to
differentiate a composition of two

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,320
differentiable functions and because lots
and lots of functions in the real

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,880
world are written as compositions of

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,870
differentiable functions, we'll then be
able

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,199
to differentiate just a ton more functions
by using the chain rule.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,940
Now, looking ahead a bit further to see

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,236
what else might be coming up on the
horizon.

14
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:48,923
Well, after the chain rule we're going to
learn

15
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,001
how to differentiate functions like e to
the x, natural

16
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,818
logarithm and then even further out we're
going to

17
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:58,440
learn how to differentiate trig functions
like sine and cosine.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,490
And once we have all of that, and once
we've got the chain rule, we'll

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,800
be in a position to just differentiate
anything

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,110
you could write down by combining those
functions.

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,290
And then, even further out, as we look
even further

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,670
ahead in the course, we can see some
applications of differentiation.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,060
Once we learn the mechanics of
differentiating, then

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,800
we'll be able to get to these
applications.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,990
Things like, solving optimization
problems.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,490
All right, well.

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,340
Hang in there.

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,114
We think that the chain rule, but
computations are going to get harder.

29
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:28,528
But, I know you can do it.

30
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:33,982
Good

31
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:42,164
luck.
