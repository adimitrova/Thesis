music 
weve spending a ton time 
derivatives 
this point, you might asking 
yourself, is there 
anything to derivatives, 
good news is, yes 
theres a lot to see 
right i want to look chain 
rule 
chain rule tells us to 
differentiate a composition two 
differentiable functions lots 
lots functions in real 
world written compositions 
differentiable functions, well 
able 
to differentiate a ton functions 
using chain rule 
now, looking ahead a bit to see 
else might coming 
horizon 
well, chain rule going to 
learn 
to differentiate functions like e to 
x, natural 
logarithm even 
going to 
learn to differentiate trig functions 
like sine cosine 
we that, 
weve got chain rule, well 
in a position to differentiate 
anything 
you could write combining 
functions 
then, even out, we look 
even 
ahead in course, we see 
applications differentiation 
we learn mechanics 
differentiating, 
well able to get to 
applications 
things like, solving optimization 
problems 
right, well 
hang in there 
we think that chain rule, 
computations going to get harder 
but, i know you 
good 
luck
