00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,230
My other massive open online courses are
built around a calendar.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,930
There's a start date, an end date, and

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,200
then new material gets released every
single week.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,325
In contrast, this course is self-paced,
meaning that not only can you sign

7
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:25,390
up at any time, but you can start this
course at any time.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,910
And then you can work through the material

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,760
as quickly or as methodically as you'd
like.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,500
My hope is that this new format will just
let a

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,800
lot more people learn a lot more math, but
it's an experiment.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,770
You know?

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,640
And I hope that you'll be able to provide
some feedback

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,620
as to what's working well and what still
needs to be improved.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,076
So I personally just really appreciate any
feedback that you can

16
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:53,422
provide about this course and about how we
can make it better.

17
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:55,802
You know, I hope that working together we

18
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:59,804
can really produce just a fantastic
experience learning calculus.
