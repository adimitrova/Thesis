massive open online courses 
built around a calendar 
theres a start date, an end date, 
new material gets released every 
single week 
blankaudio 
in contrast, this course is selfpaced, 
meaning that you sign 
time, you start this 
course time 
you work material 
quickly methodically youd 
like 
hope is that this new format will 
let a 
lot people learn a lot math, 
an experiment 
you know 
i hope that youll able to provide 
feedback 
to whats working well still 
needs to improved 
so i personally really appreciate 
feedback that you 
provide this course we 
make better 
you know, i hope that working together we 
really produce a fantastic 
experience learning calculus
