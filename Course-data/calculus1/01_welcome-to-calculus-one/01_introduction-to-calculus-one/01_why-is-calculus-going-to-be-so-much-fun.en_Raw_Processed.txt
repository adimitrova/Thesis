welcome to calculus one 
im glad youre in this course, maybe 
quest understanding calculus 
alright, we really a quest, you 
know, taking thousands years 
human ingenuity 
right 
sort triumph humankind to 
able to understand numbers functions 
insights that humans 
thousands years, 
distilling 
to short videos exercises 
you know, going to easy, 
right 
to take thousands years insight, 
try to cram that in to 
short online learning modules, going 
to 
challenging to understand this 
stuff 
i think payoff is worth 
you know 
anf payoff is worth it, 
concepts in calculus 
really cool 
calculus is a huge subject, 
combines a lot different topics 
you know, a calculus course this 
course, introduces things like functions 
limits, talk infinity, talk 
derivative, talk area 
integrals 
big surprise is that 
seemingly unrelated topics, end 
related 
right 
theres connections between 
different concepts that appearing in 
calculus 
i think kinds connections 
exciting 
another cool thing calculus, is that 
we get to a lot neat computations 
alright, going to learn to 
compute derivatives, compute areas 
you know, dont get wrong 
right 
end this whole process, goal 
isnt really to able to compute things 
right 
goal is insights, understanding, 
appreciation 
concepts, concepts 
connect together 
computations is certainly a 
prerequisite to able to understand 
concepts 
i really hope to, to dig deeper, you 
know, to 
able to see different 
ideas within calculus related 
going to a challenging quest, 
i think 
a worthwhile quest, im glad that 
youve chosen to join us 
good luck
