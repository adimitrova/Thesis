2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,103
Welcome to calculus one.

3
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm glad you're in this course, or maybe
quest for understanding calculus.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,170
Alright, we really are on a quest, you

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,818
know, we're taking thousands of years of
human ingenuity.

6
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:20,190
Right?

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,850
The sort of triumph of humankind to be
able to understand numbers and functions.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,378
All of these insights that humans have had
for thousands of years,

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:33,080
and we're just distilling all those down
to short videos and exercises.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,040
You know, and it's not going to be easy,
all right.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,150
To take thousands of years of insight, and
try to cram that in to

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,560
short online learning modules, it's going
to

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,910
be challenging to understand all this
stuff.

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,300
But I think the payoff is worth it.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,885
You know?

16
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:47,901
Anf for me the payoff is worth it,

17
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:51,340
because the concepts in calculus are just
really cool.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,660
Calculus is a huge subject, and it
combines just a lot of different topics.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,420
You know, a calculus course and this
course, introduces things like functions

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,800
and limits, talk about infinity, talk

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,790
about derivative, talk about area and
integrals.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,890
And the big surprise is that all of

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,653
these seemingly unrelated topics, end up
being related.

24
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:14,040
Right?

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,810
There's connections between all of these

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,260
different concepts that are appearing in
calculus.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,750
And I think those kinds of connections are
just very exciting.

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,140
Another cool thing about calculus, is that
we get to do a lot of neat computations.

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,950
Alright, we're going to learn how to
compute derivatives, compute areas.

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,121
You know, but don't get me wrong.

31
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:34,516
Right?

32
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:40,161
At the end of this whole process, the goal
isn't really to be able to compute things.

33
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:40,560
Right?

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,820
The goal is insights, it's understanding,
it's some appreciation

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,040
of the concepts, and how these concepts
connect together.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,530
And doing the computations is certainly a

37
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,850
prerequisite to being able to understand
those concepts.

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,328
But I really hope to, to dig deeper, you
know, and to be

39
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,920
able to see how all of these different
ideas within calculus are related.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,206
It's going to be a challenging quest, but
I think it's

41
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:10,880
a worthwhile quest, and I'm glad that
you've chosen to join us.

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,162
Good luck.

43
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:23,162
