[music] my other massive open online courses are built around a calendar.
there's a start date, an end date, and then new material gets released every single week.
[blank_audio] in contrast, this course is self-paced, meaning that not only can you sign up at any time, but you can start this course at any time.
and then you can work through the material as quickly or as methodically as you'd like.
my hope is that this new format will just let a lot more people learn a lot more math, but it's an experiment.
you know?
and i hope that you'll be able to provide some feedback as to what's working well and what still needs to be improved.
so i personally just really appreciate any feedback that you can provide about this course and about how we can make it better.
you know, i hope that working together we can really produce just a fantastic experience learning calculus.
