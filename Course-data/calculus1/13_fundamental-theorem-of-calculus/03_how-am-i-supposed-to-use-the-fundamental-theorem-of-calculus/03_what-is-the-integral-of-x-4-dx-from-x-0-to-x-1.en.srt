[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:08,541
Let's find the area under graph of a 
polynomial. 

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:14,850
So let's integrate from 0 to 1, the 
function x to the 4th dx. 

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,430
To solve this problem, I can use the 
fundamental theorem of calculus. 

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,360
So the first step is to find an 
anti-derivative of x to the 4th. 

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,464
Well, what's an antiderivative just for x 
to the n? 

7
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:30,830
Right, as long as n isn't minus 1, an 
antiderivative for this is x to the n 

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,874
plus 1 over n plus 1 plus c. 
So for this specific problem, right, 

9
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:38,550
what's an antiderivative for x to the 
4th? 

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,550
Well, that'll be x to the fifth over 5 
plus some constant c. 

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,124
And it doesn't matter which anti 
derivative I pick. 

12
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:51,612
So, just to emphasize that point, let's 
be a little bit ridiculous and, pick my 

13
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:55,572
anti derivative that I'm calling big F, 
to be x to the fifth over 5 plus 17, 

14
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:59,836
right? 
And this really is an anti derivative for 

15
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:03,600
x to the 4th. 
Because if I differentiate this function, 

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
I get the derivative next to the flipped 
over five, which is 5x to the 4th over 5 

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,012
plus the derivative 17, which is 0. 
And 5x to the fourth over 5 is just x to 

18
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:17,890
the 4th. 
So I really have found an anti-derivative 

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,950
for x to the fourth right here. 
It's x to the 4th over 5 plus 17. 

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,740
Now I apply the fundamental theorem. 
So the fundamental theorem tells me that, 

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,058
to integrate from 0 to 1. 
The function, x to the 4th is the same as 

22
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,280
evaluating an anti derivative for x to 
the fourth at 1. 

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,310
And subtracting that anti derivative 
evaluated at 0. 

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,430
In this case, my chosen anti derivative 
is this function. 

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,837
So I plug in 1. 
I get 1 to the 5th over 5, plus 17, minus 

26
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:53,010
what I get when I plug in 0, which is 0 
to the 5th over 5, plus 17. 

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:03,400
And one fifth plus 17, minus 17 Well this 
is just 1 5th. 

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,524
I can really see this fact. 
So here's a graph of the function y 

29
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:11,062
equals x to the 4th, and we just saw is 
that the integral from 0 to 1 of x to the 

30
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:14,658
4th dx is 1 5th, so there must be 1 5th 
of a square unit of area underneath this 

31
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:20,390
graph. 
Let me get out my scissors. 

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,284
Well here's a rectangle, and the width of 
this rectangle is one and the height of 

33
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:27,824
this rectangle is a 5th, so this 
rectangle contains 1 5th of a square unit 

34
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:33,140
of area, and it's the same as the area 
under this graph. 

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,823
So let me cut this rectangle a bit. 
I'll shove that piece Under there and 

36
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:46,214
I've got this leftover piece which I 
guess I have to do something with. 

37
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:48,550
Huh. 
Maybe I'll turn it over. 

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:56,448
Maybe I'll cut off this piece here. 
I'll put that there. 

39
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:59,682
I'll rip this there, and sort of shove 
that in there, and there'll be a little 

40
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:03,286
bit up there... 
I mean it's not great, the job that I did 

41
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:07,255
here, but it's at least believable that 
there's a 5th of a square unit of area 

42
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:12,651
underneath this graph. 
Admittedly this particular case, the area 

43
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,431
under the graph of X to a power, this 
particular case was known to Fermont 

44
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:20,350
before Newton. 
And yet what we're really selling here 

45
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,115
isn't the answer to a particular problem. 
It's a general technique for approaching 

46
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,500
these area problems. 
If you want to find the area under a 

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,920
graph of a function instead of trying to 
do it by hand You can apply the 

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,640
fundamental theorem of calculus and 
reduce it to an antidifferentiation 

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,710
problem, which hopefully is easier. 
This is an example of the way in which 

50
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,742
mathematics is a democratizing force. 
Problems that at one time would have been 

51
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:53,040
only accessible to the geniuses on earth. 
are now accessible to everybody, right? 

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,680
At one time in history, you would've had 
to been the smartest person on Earth in 

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,450
order to calculate the area of some 
curved object. 

54
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,294
And yet now, armed with the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, we can all take part 

55
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:14,914
in these area calculations.
