lets use fundamental theorem 
calculus to evaluate an integral 
lets integral zero to pi 
sine x dx 
lets call this function little f 
so, f x, little f x, will sine 
x 
now, i need to find an antiderivative 
little f, right 
i need a function whose derivative is sin 
x 
i know one already, right 
derivative minus cosine x 
well, if derivative cosine is 
minus sine, ive got a minus sign 
there 
thats a little joke 
right 
derivative minus cosine x is 
sine x 
so, minus cosine x is an 
antiderivative sine x 
now, fundamental theorem 
calculus tell us to 
fundamental theorem calculus tells 
that if i want to integrate this 
function little f, i find an 
antiderivative, ive located, 
right 
minus cosine, evaluate that 
antiderivative end points 
take difference 
so, in this particular case i 
get 
so, in this case, ive got a function big 
f, right this is antiderivative, 
minus cosine x 
according to fundamental theorem, 
if i want to integrate zero to pi, 
function little f, is sine x, 
im going to evaluate antiderivative 
pi subtract antiderivative 
zero 
in this case chosen antiderivative is 
minus cosine x 
so, minus cosine pi minus, minus 
cosine zero 
now, whats cosine pi 
thats minus negative minus 
thats minus cosine zero is , 
negative 
so, minus negative , is 
there exactly square units area 
graph sine x 
between x equals x equals pi 
we actually see that fact 
well, heres a graph y equals sine x 
interval that we did, 
area this curve is square units 
well, heres square units, right 
maxium value sine is 
so, this is height 
sine hits maximum here 
width, this rectangle is 
so, this is square units 
claim is that i able to 
fit this graph 
so, ive got scissors here ill 
start cutting 
if i cut 
here, this part now, fits pretty 
well graph 
ive got this little bit left 
let 
chop this here 
i mean this is, this is looking pretty 
good 
right 
i mean thats not, perfect i 
mean, you know, looks like 
square units fit underneath this graph 
i always thought a little bit 
surprising that answer, area 
graph sine x, turned to 
exactly square units 
i mean, you might thought that 
answer would involve pi something 
answer ends a lot nicer 
i think you might expected
