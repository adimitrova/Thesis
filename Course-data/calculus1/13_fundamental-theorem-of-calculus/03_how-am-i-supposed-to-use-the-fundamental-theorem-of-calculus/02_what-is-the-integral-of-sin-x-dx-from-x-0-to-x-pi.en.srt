[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,912
Let's use the fundamental theorem of 
calculus to evaluate an integral. 

3
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:16,930
Let's do the integral from zero to pi of 
sine x dx. 

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,772
Let's call this function little f. 
So, f of x, little f of x, will be sine 

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:27,270
of x. 
Now, I need to find an anti-derivative 

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,916
for little f, right? 
I need a function whose derivative is sin 

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:36,094
of x. 
I know one already, right? 

8
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:41,618
The derivative of minus cosine of x. 
Well, if the derivative of cosine is 

9
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,970
minus sine, then I've got a minus sign 
there. 

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,230
That's a little joke. 
All right? 

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,778
The derivative of minus cosine of x is 
sine of x. 

12
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:53,535
So, minus cosine of x is an 
anti-derivative for sine of x. 

13
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:57,310
Now, what does the fundamental theorem of 
calculus tell us to do? 

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,278
The fundamental theorem of calculus tells 
me that if I want to integrate this 

15
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:05,060
function little f, I should find an 
antiderivative, which I've located, 

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,006
right? 
Minus cosine, and then evaluate that 

17
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:13,410
antiderivative at these end points and 
take the difference. 

18
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,430
So, in this particular case what do I 
get? 

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,536
So, in this case, I've got a function big 
F, right this is my antiderivative, and 

20
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:27,110
it's minus cosine of x. 
And according to the fundamental theorem, 

21
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,380
if I want to integrate from zero to pi, 
my function little f, which is sine x, 

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,070
I'm going to evaluate the antiderivative 
at pi and subtract the antiderivative at 

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,606
zero. 
In this case my chosen antiderivative is 

24
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:46,108
minus cosine x. 
So, it's minus cosine pi minus, minus 

25
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:50,930
cosine zero. 
Now, what's cosine of pi? 

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,604
That's minus 1 but it's negative minus 1. 
That's 1 minus and cosine of zero is 1, 

27
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:04,754
but it's negative 1. 
So, it's 1 minus negative 1, which is 2. 

28
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:10,890
There are exactly 2 square units of area 
under the graph of sine of x. 

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,750
between x equals 0 and x equals pi. 
can we actually see that fact? 

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,422
Well, here's a graph of y equals sine x 
and by the interval that we just did, the 

31
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:28,470
area under this curve is 2 square units. 
Well, here's 2 square units, right? 

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,845
The maxium value of sine is 1. 
So, this is just at the same height as 

33
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:38,630
where sine hits its maximum here. 
And its width, this rectangle is 2. 

34
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,108
So, this is 2 square units. 
And the claim is that I should be able to 

35
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:44,525
just about fit this under the graph. 
So, I've got my scissors here and I'll 

36
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:48,342
just start cutting. 
And if I cut. 

37
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:53,480
here, this part now, and it fits pretty 
well with the graph. 

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,950
And I've got this little bit left over. 
Let me just. 

39
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,172
Chop this off here. 
I mean this is, this is looking pretty 

40
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,250
good. 
Right? 

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,030
I mean that's not, it's not perfect but I 
mean, you know, it looks like about 2 

42
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,740
square units fit underneath this graph. 
I always thought it was a little bit 

43
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,520
surprising that the answer, the area 
under the graph of sine x, turned out to 

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,724
be exactly 2 square units. 
I mean, you might have thought that the 

45
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:25,240
answer would involve pi or something. 
And the answer ends up being a lot nicer 

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:32,203
I think than you might have expected.
