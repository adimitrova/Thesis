lets find area graph a 
polynomial 
so lets integrate to , 
function x to th dx 
to solve this problem, i use 
fundamental theorem calculus 
so first step is to find an 
antiderivative x to th 
well, whats an antiderivative x 
to n 
right, long n isnt minus , an 
antiderivative this is x to n 
plus n plus plus c 
so this specific problem, right, 
whats an antiderivative x to 
th 
well, thatll x to fifth 
plus constant c 
doesnt matter anti 
derivative i pick 
so, to emphasize that point, lets 
a little bit ridiculous and, pick 
anti derivative that im calling big f, 
to x to fifth plus , 
right 
this really is an anti derivative 
x to th 
if i differentiate this function, 
i get derivative next to flipped 
five, is x to th 
plus derivative , is 
x to fourth is x to 
th 
so i really found an antiderivative 
x to fourth right here 
x to th plus 
i apply fundamental theorem 
so fundamental theorem tells that, 
to integrate to 
function, x to th is 
evaluating an anti derivative x to 
fourth 
subtracting that anti derivative 
evaluated 
in this case, chosen anti derivative 
is this function 
so i plug in 
i get to th , plus , minus 
i get i plug in , is 
to th , plus 
one fifth plus , minus well this 
is th 
i really see this fact 
so heres a graph function y 
equals x to th, we saw is 
that integral to x to 
th dx is th, so there must th 
a square unit area underneath this 
graph 
let get scissors 
well heres a rectangle, width 
this rectangle is one height 
this rectangle is a th, so this 
rectangle contains th a square unit 
area, area 
this graph 
so let cut this rectangle a bit 
ill shove that piece there 
ive got this leftover piece i 
guess i to something 
huh 
maybe ill turn 
maybe ill cut this piece here 
ill put that there 
ill rip this there, sort shove 
that in there, therell a little 
bit there 
i mean great, job that i 
here, least believable that 
theres a th a square unit area 
underneath this graph 
admittedly this particular case, area 
graph x to a power, this 
particular case known to fermont 
newton 
yet really selling here 
isnt answer to a particular problem 
a general technique approaching 
area problems 
if you want to find area a 
graph a function instead trying to 
hand you apply 
fundamental theorem calculus 
reduce to an antidifferentiation 
problem, hopefully is easier 
this is an example way in 
mathematics is a democratizing force 
problems that one time would 
accessible to geniuses earth 
accessible to everybody, right 
one time in history, you wouldve 
to smartest person earth in 
order to calculate area 
curved object 
yet now, armed fundamental 
theorem calculus, we take part 
in area calculations
