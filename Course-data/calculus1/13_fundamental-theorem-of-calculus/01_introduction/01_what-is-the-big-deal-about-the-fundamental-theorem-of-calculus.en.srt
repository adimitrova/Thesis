00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,600
Where are we in the course?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,850
Well we've seen some stuff about
anti-differentation, alright.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,430
We learned how to start with a function,
and

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,320
find a function whose derivative is that
original function.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,380
We've also had the sudden change of pace,
where we looked at integrals.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,389
We looked at areas under the curves.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,050
And now, I want to take those

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,520
two seemingly unrelated topics and connect
them together.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,970
That's what the fundamental theorem of
calculus is, is going to do for us.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,420
Alright, the fundamental theorem of
calculus, tells us

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,090
that evaluating integrals really amounts
to finding anti-derivatives.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,800
These two seemingly unrelated concepts of

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,220
differentiation, and integration are
really related.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,950
And this is really key insight of calculus
as a whole.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,530
I mean think about it, in what sense did
Newton and Leibniz discover calculus.

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,730
Greek mathematics had these ideas right,
Greek mathematicians

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,000
were calculating areas of curved objects
by taking limits.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,020
I have formulas for the areas of circles.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,440
And the idea is of slope, okay, predate
Newton and Livenets.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,200
So, what was the insight that, that means

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,475
that we credit Newton and Leibniz with
discovering calculus?

23
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:23,690
What really amounts to the fundamental
theorem of calculus?

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,780
It amounts to this idea that,

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,640
differentiation and integration are
somehow related.

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,780
By thinking systematically and precisely,
about

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,790
how a function changes when you wiggle

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,530
its input, and in particular, thinking

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,680
about a derivative of the accumulation
function.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,140
Alright, we're able to see this, this
relationship between

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,820
evaluating a definite integral, and
finding an AI derivative.

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,250
And I want to do more now, than, than just
show

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,400
you how to calculate integrals, by using
the fundamental theorem of calculus.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,150
That will be a big thing too, just the
process of computing.

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,240
But I hope, that you'll understand some of
the

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,670
reasons why, the fundamental theorem of
calculus is true.

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,549
So, I want to look at the fundamental
theorem

38
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,280
of calculus just from a lot of different
perspectives.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,640
Alright, we should come on away from this,
not just with the ability to compute,

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,748
but also the ability to really communicate
sort

41
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:22,724
of an understanding, of this absolutely
amazing theorem.
