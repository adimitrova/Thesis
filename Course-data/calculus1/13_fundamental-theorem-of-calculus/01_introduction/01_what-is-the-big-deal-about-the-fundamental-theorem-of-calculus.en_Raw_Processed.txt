we in course 
well weve seen stuff 
antidifferentation, alright 
we learned to start a function, 

find a function whose derivative is that 
original function 
weve also sudden change pace, 
we looked integrals 
we looked areas curves 
now, i want to take 
two seemingly unrelated topics connect 
together 
thats fundamental theorem 
calculus is, is going to us 
alright, fundamental theorem 
calculus, tells us 
that evaluating integrals really amounts 
to finding antiderivatives 
two seemingly unrelated concepts 
differentiation, integration 
really related 
this is really key insight calculus 
a whole 
i mean think it, in sense 
newton leibniz discover calculus 
greek mathematics ideas right, 
greek mathematicians 
calculating areas curved objects 
taking limits 
i formulas areas circles 
idea is slope, okay, predate 
newton livenets 
so, insight that, that means 
that we credit newton leibniz 
discovering calculus 
really amounts to fundamental 
theorem calculus 
amounts to this idea that, 
differentiation integration 
somehow related 
thinking systematically precisely, 

a function changes you wiggle 
input, in particular, thinking 
a derivative accumulation 
function 
alright, able to see this, this 
relationship between 
evaluating a definite integral, 
finding an ai derivative 
i want to now, than, 
show 
you to calculate integrals, using 
fundamental theorem calculus 
that will a big thing too, 
process computing 
i hope, that youll understand 

reasons why, fundamental theorem 
calculus is true 
so, i want to look fundamental 
theorem 
calculus a lot different 
perspectives 
alright, we come away this, 
ability to compute, 
also ability to really communicate 
sort 
an understanding, this absolutely 
amazing theorem
