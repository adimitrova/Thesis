music 
i want to begin a statement 
fundamental theorem calculus 
suppose function little f, 
closed interval a to b, to real 
numbers, is a continuous function 
lets define a function big f, to 
accumulation function 
right, thats integral 
a to x function left 
well function big f turns to 
continuous in closed interval a to 
b differentiable open interval a 
to b this is big point 
derivative big f is little f 
weve seen a bit evidence this 
already 
suppose i got accumulation 
function 
so big f x is integral a to x 
f tdt 
i ask, is 
accumulation function changing 
well, accumulation function is 
increasing, meaning derivative is 
positive if function that im 
integrating is positive 
accumulation function is 
decreasing, meaning derivative is 
negative 
if function that im integrating is 
negative 
this suggests that derivative 
accumulation function 
function that im integrating might 
related in way 
heres a graph thats particularly 
compelling 
so, ill draw coordinate plane, 
heres y axis, heres axis in 
this case ill draw random 
looking graph 
thatll graph y equals f 
ill pick point 
ill call a point x 
ill look area 
graph between a x, rigth 
thats integral a to x f 
d 
right that area is accumulation 
function evaluated x 
whats derivative 
accumulation function 
got accumulation function, right 
fx equals interval a to x that 
ftdt i dont know that changes 
x changes 
so lets make a small change in x 
lets go x 
to say x plus h ask 
area in this region compare to area 
in this much larger region 
whats big f x plus h minus big f 
x 
yeah, so whats f x plus h right 
thats area 
a to x plus h, minus f x, big f 
x 
thats area a to x, that 
difference, right 
that difference is area inside 
here 
that little leftover piece is practically 
a rectangle height, f x, little f 
x width h 
i mean, this region is quite a 
rectangle 
awfully close to a rectangle of, 
width h 
area f x plus h minus f x 
now, remember, goal to 
differentiate accumulation function 
ive got is this rectangle 
whose width is h, whose height, 
you think it, f x 
so whats this rectangle 
alright 
i mean ive really got here is a 
rectangle area is f x 
plus h minus f x, this accumulation 
function 
width is h, height is 
f x 
well ive got a rectangle this area 
this width and, this height 
alright, i know 
i know height times width is 
area, so if i take area divide 
width, i get height 
this is approximate, 
lets write that 
i area this you know, rectangle is 
f x plus h minus f x 
if i divide width, i 
get, height 
that mean i take a limit 
oh course this is approximately 
true, if i take a limit, right 
if i take a limit h approaches 
this gives derivative 
accumulation function that will in 
fact equal to functions value 
that is whole game 
accumulation function f is an 
antiderivative f 
well this, i mean this is really 
remarkable 
instance you might wondering 
whats an antiderivative this 
function, little f x equals e to 
negative x squared 
well if a functions continuous we 
find an antiderivative 
antidirivitive is accumulation 
function 
so an antiderivative either 
negative x squared is accumulation 
function 
i define a function big f x to 
intregal a to x, number 
a, e to negative squared d 
if i differentiate this accumulation 
function, i get back e to negative x 
squared 
so i found an antiderivative 
this function 
well i cant write 
nicely 
i cant write an 
antiderivative e to negative x 
squared using functions that i 
hand 
nevertheless, antiderivative is 
accumulation function
