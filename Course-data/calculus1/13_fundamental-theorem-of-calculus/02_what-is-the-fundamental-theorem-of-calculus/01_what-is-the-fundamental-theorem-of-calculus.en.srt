00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,324
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:09,580
I want to begin with a statement of he 
fundamental theorem of calculus. 

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,935
Suppose the function little f, from the 
closed interval a to b, to the real 

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:17,394
numbers, is a continuous function. 
And let's define a function big F, to be 

5
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,535
the accumulation function. 
Right, that's the integral. 

6
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:24,882
From a to x of the function on the left 
well then the function big F turns out to 

7
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:29,505
be continuous in the closed interval a to 
b differentiable on the open interval a 

8
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:36,490
to b and this is the big point the 
derivative of big F is little f. 

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,665
We've seen a bit of evidence for this 
already. 

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,680
And suppose I got the accumulation 
function. 

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,110
So big F of x is the integral from a to x 
of f of tdt. 

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,010
And now I can ask, how is the 
accumulation function changing? 

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,234
Well, the accumulation function is 
increasing, meaning it's derivative is 

14
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,770
positive if the function that I'm 
integrating is positive. 

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,552
And the accumulation function is 
decreasing, meaning the derivative is 

16
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:05,442
negative. 
If the function that I'm integrating is 

17
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:08,664
negative. 
And this suggests that the derivative of 

18
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:12,136
the accumulation function and the 
function that I'm integrating might be 

19
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:16,570
related in some way. 
Here's a graph that's particularly 

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,180
compelling. 
So, I'll draw the coordinate plane, 

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,220
here's the y axis, here's the t axis in 
this case and I'll draw some Random 

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,030
looking graph. 
That'll be the graph y equals f of t. 

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,080
And then I'll pick some point. 
I'll call it a and some other point x. 

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,580
And then I'll look at the area under the 
graph between a and x, rigth? 

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,368
And that's the integral from a to x of f 
of t d t. 

26
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,680
Right that area is the accumulation 
function evaluated x. 

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,700
Now what's the derivative of the 
accumulation function. 

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,254
What got the accumulation function, right 
f(x) equals the interval from a to x that 

29
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,970
f(t)dt and I don't know how that changes 
when x changes. 

30
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,340
So lets make a small change in x. 
Lets go from x. 

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,758
To say x plus h and then ask how does the 
area in this region compare to the area 

32
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:21,920
in this much larger region. 
What's big F of x plus h minus big F of 

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,726
x? 
Yeah, so what's F of x plus h right 

34
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:31,887
that's the area. 
From a to x plus h, minus F of x, big F 

35
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:36,629
of x. 
That's the area from a to x, and that 

36
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:41,929
difference, right. 
That difference is just the area inside 

37
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:46,068
here. 
That little leftover piece is practically 

38
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:51,335
a rectangle of height, f of x, little f 
of x and width h. 

39
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,710
I mean, this region is not quite a 
rectangle. 

40
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,060
But it's awfully close to a rectangle of, 
width h. 

41
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,602
And area f of x plus h minus f of x. 
Now, remember, by goal was to 

42
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:08,598
differentiate the accumulation function. 
And all I've got is this rectangle. 

43
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:16,330
Whose width is about h, and whose height, 
you think about it, it's about f of x. 

44
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,990
So what's up with this rectangle? 
Alright? 

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,828
I mean what I've really got here is a 
rectangle and its area is about f of x 

46
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:29,310
plus h minus f of x, this accumulation 
function. 

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,436
It's width is h, and it's height is about 
f of x. 

48
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:38,270
Well I've got a rectangle with this area 
and this width and, and this height. 

49
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,062
Alright, what do I know? 
I know its height times its width is its 

50
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:46,770
area, so if I take its area and divide by 
its width, I should get its height. 

51
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,930
Now all this is just approximate, but 
let's write that down. 

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,930
I The area of this you know, rectangle is 
f of x plus h minus f of x. 

53
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,990
And if I divide by the width, I should 
get, the height. 

54
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,042
What does that mean after I take a limit? 
Oh of course this is only approximately 

55
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:11,784
true, but if I take a limit, right. 
If I take a limit as h approaches 0. 

56
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:16,992
This gives me the derivative of the 
accumulation function and that will in 

57
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:23,800
fact be equal to the function's value. 
And that is the whole game. 

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,385
The accumulation function F is an 
antiderivative of f. 

59
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,740
Well this, I mean this is really 
remarkable. 

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,221
For instance you might be wondering 
what's an anti-derivative of this 

61
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:40,450
function, little f of x equals e to the 
negative x squared? 

62
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,509
Well if a functions continuous then we 
can find an anti-derivative. 

63
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,370
The anti-dirivitive is the accumulation 
function. 

64
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,898
So an anti-derivative of either the 
negative x squared is the accumulation 

65
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:54,920
function. 
I can define a function big f of x to be 

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,390
the intregal from a to x, for some number 
a, of e to the negative t squared d t. 

67
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,013
And if I differentiate this accumulation 
function, I get back e to the negative x 

68
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,846
squared. 
So I found an anti-derivative. 

69
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:12,202
For this function. 
Well I can't write it down any more 

70
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:14,304
nicely. 
Because I can't write down an 

71
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:18,000
anti-derivative for e to the negative x 
squared using the functions that I have 

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,300
at hand. 
But nevertheless, the anti-derivative is 

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,033
the accumulation function.
