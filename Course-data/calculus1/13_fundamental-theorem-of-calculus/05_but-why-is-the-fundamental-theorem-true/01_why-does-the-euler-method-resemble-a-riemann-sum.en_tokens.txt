remember
back
to
those
good
old
days
when
we
were
approximating
antiderivatives
by
using
euler
's
method
?
i
'm
going
to
be
started
with
some
function
little
f
and
i
wanted
to
numerically
approximate
a
function
big
f
,
whose
derivative
was
little
f.
and
maybe
i
know
big
f
's
value
at
0
is
exactly
0
,
and
i
want
to
numerically
approximate
big
f
for
values
away
from
0.
and
the
we
did
repeated
linear
approximation
.
i
pick
some
tiny
h
,
and
then
i
approximated
big
f
of
h.
well
,
what
do
i
know
about
big
f
big
f
's
derivative
is
little
f.
so
my
approximation
for
big
f
at
h
is
the
value
of
big
f
at
0
plus
h
times
the
derivative
of
big
f
at
0.
well
,
what
is
this
?
the
value
of
big
f
at
0
is
exactly
equal
to
0.
and
,
i
got
plus
h
times
,
and
the
derivative
of
big
f
is
little
f.
so
times
little
f
at
0.
so
i
can
use
this
as
my
approximation
for
big
f
at
h.
and
then
i
did
it
again
.
so
,
i
want
to
approximate
big
f
at
2h
.
well
that
's
big
f
at
h
approximately
.
i
mean
i
'm
writing
equals
but
i
really
mean
approximately
.
big
f
of
h
plus
h
times
the
derivative
of
big
f
at
h
,
right
?
i
start
at
f
of
h
and
i
'm
going
to
wiggle
over
by
h
and
the
derivative
is
encoding
at
least
approximately
,
how
much
the
output
should
change
for
a
given
input
change
.
this
is
what
i
get
by
doing
another
linear
approximation
.
but
now
i
've
already
got
an
approximation
for
big
f
at
h.
it
's
h
times
f
of
zero
.
so
i
'll
use
that
for
my
value
of
big
f
at
h.
h
times
f
of
0
plus
h
times
.
and
i
know
f
prime
of
h.
i
know
big
f
's
derivative
is
little
f.
so
i
can
use
that
here
.
so
this
is
just
little
f.
at
h
,
so
this
is
an
approximation
for
big
f
at
2
h.
and
then
i
did
it
a
third
time
.
so
then
this
is
the
method
of
euler
,
right
?
i
want
to
approximate
big
f
at
3
h.
well
that
'll
be
big
f
at
2
h
,
plus
how
much
i
wiggled
by
,
which
is
h
times
the
derivative
ff
big
f
at
2
h.
and
what
do
i
know
?
well
,
i
've
already
got
an
approximation
for
big
f
at
2
h
,
it
's
right
here
.
so
,
it
's
h
times
little
f
of
0
plus
h
times
little
f
of
h
plus
h
times
,
and
now
what
's
my
derivative
of
big
f
at
2
h
?
well
,
big
f
's
derivative
is
little
f.
so
i
can
use
that
here
.
this
will
be
little
f
at
2
h.
and
i
just
keep
on
going
.
i
want
to
approximate
big
f
at
10
h
,
right
.
i
just
be
repeating
this
process
.
it
'll
be
h
times
f
of
0
plus
h
times
f
of
h.
plus
h
times
f
of
2h
,
and
it
will
keep
on
going
until
i
get
to
h
times
f
of
9h
.
now
,
what
does
that
look
like
?
this
looks
like
a
riemann
sum
,
right
,
and
i
would
want
to
choose
h
to
be
very
small
.
so
,
really
,
if
i
wanted
to
approximate
big
f
of
x
using
the
method
of
euler
i
'd
be
using
smaller
and
smaller
values
of
h
and
calculating
it
like
this
,
and
what
would
i
be
calculating
?
i
'd
just
be
calculating
the
integral
from
0
to
x
of
my
function
,
right
,
of
little
f
of
td
,
dt
.
and
what
do
i
know
about
accumulation
functions
?
well
,
i
know
that
the
derivative
of
the
accumulation
function
,
right
,
is
the
original
function
.
and
that
's
exactly
what
i
want
,
right
?
i
mean
,
this
is
saying
that
the
derivative
of
big
f
is
little
f.
so
euler
's
method
amounts
to
calculating
a
riemann
's
sum
.
and
riemann
's
sum
approximates
an
integral
,
the
accumulation
function
,
and
the
accumulation
function
is
an
antiderivative
.
it
all
makes
sense
.
right
?
all
of
these
things
that
appear
different
are
really
the
same
thing
.
euler
's
method
then
gives
another
perspective
on
why
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
should
be
true
.
