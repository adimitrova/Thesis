weve seen happens we 
differentiate accumulation function 
thats fundamental theorem 
calculus 
if i take derivative integral 
a to b f x dx, well i 
get 
well, f 
b, right 
rate change 
accumulation function is functions 
value 
but, would happen if i to 
differentiate respect to left 
hand end point instead respect to 
right hand end point 
i mean 
whats derivative respect to a 
integral a to b f x dx 
right 
happens if instead diferentiating 
respect to top end point, im 
diferentiating respect to bottom 
end point 
im asking is this function a 
function a changing 
lets think graph 
lets draw coordinate axes 
ill draw random looking 
function 
ill pick points a b 
integral a to b calculates 
area in here 
i want to know that integral 
change i wiggle a 
im asking to differentiate integral 
respect to this 
lefthand endpoint 
so lets wiggle lefthand endpoint 
lets move a little bit to a plus 
h 
im imagining h is small 
alright, i want to know, 
integral change 
well quantity that calculates 
absolute change in integral is this 
whats this thing here 
this is integral a plus h to b 
this thing here is integral 
a to b, so this difference is telling 
integral changes i replace a 
a plus h 
if you think it, this is 
really calculating is, you know, related 
to integral a plus h, 
right 
this integral is calculating this area, 
subtracting this larger area 
so difference is really this 
area in here between a ah 
comes a negative sign im 
subtracting this smaller area im 
subtracting this larger area 
so ive got this negative sign here 
this region, if h is small enough, is 
practically a rectangle, 
practically a rectangle width h 
height lets say f a 
so, that means that this difference is 
least approximately h times 
functions value a 
that help 
remember im trying to calculate 
i, im trying to differentiate 
interval a to respect to a 
that means im trying to take limit 
this difference quotient 
numerator here, we saw, is 
approximately, negative h times f a 
that means in limit i expect to 
get an answer negative f a, 
alright, hs will cancel in 
limit, thats exactly i hope 
for, right 
derivitive integral a to 
b respect to left hand endpoint 
a is negative f a 
so i summarize this 
so i summarize this 
derivative respect to a 
integral a to b f x dx is 
negative f a 
this fact coheres a certain 
convention integration 
convention that we use is that if we 
integrate a to b 
function f x dx thats negative 
interval b to a f x dx 
so if you integrate wrong way, so to 
speak, we want to count that negative 
area 
in light this convention, 
we know 
so d da integral a to b f 
x dx is d da this, negative 
integral b to a f x dx 
this is derivative top 
end point is usual 
fundamental theorem calculus 
so this is negative f a 
so upshot here is that 
differentiating integral a to b, 
respect to left hand bottom 
end point, is negative functions 
value 
that make sense if you 
increase left hand endpoint that 
decreases area 
alright, so seems reasonable that a 
negative sign popping there 
cool thing is that, that fact is 
cohering a convention 
integration 
that compared to integrating usual 
way, if you integrate wrong way you 
introduce a negative sign
