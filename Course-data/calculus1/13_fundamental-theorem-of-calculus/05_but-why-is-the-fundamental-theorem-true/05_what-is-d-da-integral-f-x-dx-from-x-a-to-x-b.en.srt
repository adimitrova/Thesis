1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,200
We've seen what happens when we 
differentiate the accumulation function. 

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,550
That's the fundamental theorem of 
calculus. 

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,918
If I take the derivative of the integral 
from a to b of f of x dx, well what do I 

4
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:22,470
get? 
Well, it's just f. 

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,931
Of b, right? 
The rate of the change of the 

6
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,906
accumulation function is the functions 
value. 

7
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:31,322
But, what would happen if I were to 
differentiate with respect to the left 

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:35,910
hand end point instead of with respect to 
the right hand end point? 

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,059
By which I mean. 
What's the derivative with respect to a 

10
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,668
of the integral from a to b of f of x dx. 
Right. 

11
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:47,090
What happens if instead of diferentiating 
with respect to the top end point, I'm 

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,470
diferentiating with respect to the bottom 
end point? 

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm asking how is this function as a 
function of a changing? 

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,500
Let's think about the graph. 
Let's draw my coordinate axes. 

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,490
And I'll draw some random looking 
function. 

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,312
And I'll pick some points a and b. 
And the integral from a to b calculates 

17
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:15,047
the area in here. 
And I want to know how does that integral 

18
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,880
change when I wiggle a? 
I'm asking to differentiate the integral 

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,050
with respect to this. 
Left-hand endpoint. 

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,792
So let's wiggle the left-hand endpoint. 
Let's move it over a little bit to a plus 

21
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,129
h. 
I'm imagining h is very small. 

22
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,342
Alright, and I want to know, how does the 
integral change? 

23
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:35,563
Well the quantity that calculates the 
absolute change in the integral is this. 

24
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,140
What's this thing here? 
This is the integral from a plus h to b. 

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,560
And this thing here is the integral from 
a to b, so this difference is telling me 

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,490
how the integral changes when I replace a 
by a plus h. 

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,648
Now if you think about it, what this is 
really calculating is, you know, related 

28
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:56,252
to the integral from just a plus h, 
right. 

29
00:01:56,252 --> 00:02:01,960
This integral is calculating this area, 
and subtracting this larger area. 

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,160
So the difference is really just this 
area in here between A and A+H but it 

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,640
comes with a negative sign because I'm 
subtracting this smaller area and I'm 

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,945
subtracting now this larger area. 
So I've got this negative sign here. 

33
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:22,711
Now this region, if h is small enough, is 
practically a rectangle, and it's 

34
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:30,286
practically a rectangle of width h and 
height let's say f of a. 

35
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:35,746
So, that means that this difference is at 
least approximately just h times the 

36
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:39,955
function's value at a. 
Now how does that help? 

37
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:44,933
Remember what I'm trying to calculate. 
I, I'm trying to differentiate the 

38
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:49,879
interval from a to be with respect to a. 
That means I'm trying to take the limit 

39
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,534
of this difference quotient. 
But the numerator here, we just saw, is 

40
00:02:54,534 --> 00:03:01,344
approximately, negative h times f of a. 
And that means in the limit I expect to 

41
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:06,084
get an answer of just negative f of a, 
alright, these hs will cancel in the 

42
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:12,010
limit, and that's exactly what I hope 
for, right? 

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,234
The derivitive of the integral from a to 
b with respect to the left hand endpoint 

44
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:19,910
a is negative f of a. 
So I can summarize this. 

45
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,706
So I can summarize this. 
The derivative with respect to a of the 

46
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:29,820
integral from a to b of f of x dx is 
negative f of a. 

47
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,020
This fact coheres with a certain 
convention about integration. 

48
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,870
The convention that we use is that if we 
integrate from a to b. 

49
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,566
the function f of x dx that's negative 
the interval from b to a of f of x dx. 

50
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:52,611
So if you integrate the wrong way, so to 
speak, we want to count that as negative 

51
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,755
area. 

52
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:58,140
 >> Now in light of this convention, what do 
we know? 

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,055
 >> So d da of the integral from a to b of f 

54
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:14,260
of x dx is d da of this, negative the 
integral from b to a of f of x dx. 

55
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,620
But now this is the derivative of the top 
end point which is just the usual 

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:25,610
fundamental theorem of calculus. 
So this is negative f of a. 

57
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,250
So the upshot here is that 
differentiating the integral from a to b, 

58
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,410
with respect to the left hand or bottom 
end point, Is negative the function's 

59
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,316
value. 
And that make sense because if you 

60
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:41,270
increase the left hand endpoint that 
decreases the area. 

61
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,068
Alright, so it seems reasonable that a 
negative sign should be popping up there. 

62
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:48,968
And the cool thing is that, that fact is 
cohering with a convention about 

63
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:56,012
integration. 
That compared to integrating the usual 

64
00:04:56,012 --> 00:05:06,473
way, if you integrate the wrong way you 
introduce a negative sign.
