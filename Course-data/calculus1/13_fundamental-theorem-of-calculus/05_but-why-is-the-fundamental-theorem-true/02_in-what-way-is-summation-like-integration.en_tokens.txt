i
've
been
trying
to
sell
you
on
an
analogy
.
the
analogy
is
that
integration
is
a
whole
lot
like
summation
.
now
we
've
also
seen
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
,
and
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
tells
us
that
integration
practically
amounts
to
antidifferentiation
.
so
how
does
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
fit
into
this
analogy
?
well
here
's
the
analogy
square
.
i
've
got
integrating
and
differentiating
.
and
integrating
is
like
summing
.
so
what
's
the
thing
that
's
like
differentiating
but
for
the
discrete
world
?
i
'm
claiming
it
's
differencing
.
now
how
so
?
well
,
let
's
suppose
that
i
've
got
a
list
of
numbers
.
made
my
list
of
numbers
is
something
easy
like
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
it
could
be
more
creative
.
but
let
's
suppose
this
is
my
list
of
numbers
.
the
accumulation
function
just
amounts
to
adding
up
those
numbers
.
so
in
this
case
,
it
'd
be
0
plus
1
,
1
plus
2
,
3
plus
3
,
6
plus
4
,
10
plus
5
,
and
so
forth
.
the
difference
operator
,
it
's
like
differentiation
,
but
the
difference
operator
amounts
to
writing
out
a
new
list
.
the
list
of
differences
between
success
of
numbers
.
so
in
this
case
if
i
just
had
this
list
of
numbers
,
i
could
write
down
the
differences
between
the
subsequent
numbers
in
that
list
.
1
minus
0
is
1
,
3
minus
1
is
2
,
six
minus
3
is
3
,
10
minus
6
is
4
,
15
minus
10
is
5
,
and
so
forth
.
now
if
i
were
to
look
at
the
list
of
differences
in
the
list
of
the
accumulation
function
,
i
'd
get
back
the
original
list
that
i
started
with
.
it
's
really
worth
repeating
.
right
?
taking
differences
between
the
sum
of
the
first
k
numbers
in
my
original
list
and
the
sum
of
the
first
k
minus
1
numbers
in
my
original
list
.
just
gives
me
back
my
original
list
of
numbers
.
and
this
is
an
analogous
to
the
statement
from
calculus
.
that
if
i
take
the
derivative
of
the
accumulation
function
,
i
give
back
the
original
function
.
mathematics
is
n't
just
about
isolated
facts
,
it
's
really
about
analogies
between
ideas
.
it
's
just
like
in
literature
where
metaphor
plays
such
an
important
role
.
