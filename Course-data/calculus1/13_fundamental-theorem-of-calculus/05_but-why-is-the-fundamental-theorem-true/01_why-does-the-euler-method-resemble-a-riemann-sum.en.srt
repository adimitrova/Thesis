[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:09,236
Remember back to those good old days when 
we were approximating antiderivatives by 

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:12,964
using Euler's Method? 
I'm going to be started with some 

4
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:17,320
function little f and I wanted to 
numerically approximate a function big F, 

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,825
whose derivative was little f. 
And maybe I know big F's value at 0 is 

6
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:31,370
exactly 0, and I want to numerically 
approximate big F for values away from 0. 

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,680
And the we did repeated linear 
approximation. 

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,980
I pick some tiny h, and then I 
approximated big F of h. 

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,090
Well, what do I know about big F Big F's 
derivative is little f. 

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,577
So my approximation for big F at h is the 
value of big F at 0 plus h times the 

11
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:55,760
derivative of big F at 0. 
Well, what is this? 

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,160
The value of big F at 0 is exactly equal 
to 0. 

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,390
And, I got plus h times, and the 
derivative of big F is little f. 

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,556
So times little f at 0. 
So I can use this as my approximation for 

15
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:12,830
big F at h. 
And then I did it again. 

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,580
So, I want to approximate big F at 2h. 
Well that's big F at h approximately. 

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,030
I mean I'm writing equals but I really 
mean approximately. 

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,890
Big F of h plus h times the derivative of 
big F at h, right? 

19
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,672
I start at F of h and I'm going to wiggle 
over by h and the derivative is encoding 

20
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,698
at least approximately, how much the 
output should change for a given input 

21
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:40,346
change. 
This is what I get by doing another 

22
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:43,950
linear approximation. 
But now I've already got an approximation 

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,060
for big f at h. 
It's h times f of zero. 

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,120
So I'll use that for my value of big F at 
h. 

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,630
H times f of 0 plus h times. 
And I know F prime of h. 

26
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,470
I know big F's derivative is little f. 
So I can use that here. 

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,622
So this is just little f. 
At h, so this is an approximation for big 

28
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:09,580
F at 2 h. 
And then I did it a third time. 

29
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,750
So then this is the method of Euler, 
right? 

30
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,585
I want to approximate big F at 3 h. 
Well that'll be big F at 2 h, plus how 

31
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:24,210
much I wiggled by, which is h times the 
derivative ff big F at 2 h. 

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,594
And what do I know? 
Well, I've already got an approximation 

33
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:31,232
for big F at 2 h, it's right here. 
So, it's h times little f of 0 plus h 

34
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:39,270
times little f of h plus h times, and now 
what's my derivative of big F at 2 h? 

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,360
Well, big F's derivative is little f. 
So I can use that here. 

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,110
This will be little f at 2 h. 
And I just keep on going. 

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,330
I want to approximate big F at 10 h, 
right. 

38
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,710
I just be repeating this process. 
It'll be h times f of 0 plus h times f of 

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,376
h. 
Plus h times f of 2h, and it will keep on 

40
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:10,840
going until I get to h times f of 9h. 
Now, what does that look like? 

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,760
This looks like a Riemann Sum, right, and 
I would want to choose h to be very 

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,654
small. 
So, really, if I wanted to approximate 

43
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:23,686
big F of x using the method of Euler I'd 
be using smaller and smaller values of h 

44
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:29,200
and calculating it like this, and what 
would I be calculating? 

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,560
I'd just be calculating the integral from 
0 to x of my function, right, of little f 

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,558
of td, dt. 
And what do I know about accumulation 

47
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:42,668
functions? 
Well, I know that the derivative of the 

48
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:48,782
accumulation function, right, is the 
original function. 

49
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:55,141
And that's exactly what I want, right? 
I mean, this is saying that the 

50
00:03:55,141 --> 00:04:01,188
derivative of big F is little f. 
So Euler's method amounts to calculating 

51
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:04,343
a Riemann's sum. 
And Riemann's sum approximates an 

52
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:07,934
integral, the accumulation function, and 
the accumulation function is an 

53
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:11,356
antiderivative. 
it all makes sense. 

54
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,200
Right? 
All of these things that appear different 

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,052
are really the same thing. 
Euler's method then gives another 

56
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:29,073
perspective on why the fundamental 
theorem of calculus should be true.
