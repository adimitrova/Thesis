[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:08,350
I've been trying to sell you on an 
analogy. 

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,214
The analogy is that integration is a 
whole lot like summation. 

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,634
Now we've also seen the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, and the fundamental 

5
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:21,646
theorem of calculus tells us that 
integration practically amounts to 

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:26,464
antidifferentiation. 
So how does the fundamental theorem of 

7
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:30,710
calculus fit into this analogy? 
Well here's the analogy square. 

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,520
I've got integrating and differentiating. 
And integrating is like summing. 

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,870
So what's the thing that's like 
differentiating but for the discrete 

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,160
world? 
I'm claiming it's differencing. 

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,018
Now how so? 
Well, let's suppose that I've got a list 

12
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:50,816
of numbers. 
Made my list of numbers is something easy 

13
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:55,890
like one, two, three, four, five, it 
could be more creative. 

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,740
But let's suppose this is my list of 
numbers. 

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,370
The accumulation function just amounts to 
adding up those numbers. 

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:10,710
So in this case, it'd be 0 plus 1, 1 plus 
2, 3 plus 3, 6 plus 4, 10 plus 5, and so 

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,630
forth. 
The difference operator, it's like 

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,536
differentiation, but the difference 
operator amounts to writing out a new 

19
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:23,774
list. 
The list of differences between success 

20
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:26,750
of numbers. 
So in this case if I just had this list 

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,582
of numbers, I could write down the 
differences between the subsequent 

22
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:34,650
numbers in that list. 
1 minus 0 is 1, 3 minus 1 is 2, six minus 

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,358
3 is 3, 10 minus 6 is 4, 15 minus 10 is 
5, and so forth. 

24
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,738
Now if I were to look at the list of 
differences in the list of the 

25
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:50,690
accumulation function, I'd get back the 
original list that I started with. 

26
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,950
It's really worth repeating. 
Right? 

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,434
Taking differences between the sum of the 
first k numbers in my original list and 

28
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:59,820
the sum of the first k minus 1 numbers in 
my original list. 

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,320
Just gives me back my original list of 
numbers. 

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,810
And this is an analogous to the statement 
from calculus. 

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,212
That if I take the derivative of the 
accumulation function, I give back the 

32
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:15,619
original function. 
Mathematics isn't just about isolated 

33
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,440
facts, It's really about analogies 
between ideas. 

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:31,473
It's just like in literature where 
metaphor plays such an important role.
