[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,750
Let's think about the fundamental theorem 
of calculus physically. 

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,270
Let's define the function v by the rule 
that v of t is my velocity at time t. 

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,724
Physically, what does the accumulation 
function of velocity mean? 

5
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:27,870
Well that accumulation function, 
remember, is say, the integral from 0 to 

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,174
b, of v of t dt. 
And this is really the distance, that 

7
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:45,769
I've traveled from time 0 to time b. 
This also makes sense when we think back 

8
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:50,028
to Riemann sums. 
But what would the Riemann sum say? 

9
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:54,584
if I think about how far I traveled over 
a short time period, say, between time 

10
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:59,060
zero and time h for some small number h, 
right? 

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,170
How far did I travel during that time 
period? 

12
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,708
Well, I traveled for that small time 
period h and I was traveling at a speed 

13
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:11,132
of, I mean, you know, a velocity at time 
zero, say, is a good approximation. 

14
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:15,474
And I imagine my velocity didn't change 
very much during this time period. 

15
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:19,830
So, that's a pretty good approximation 
for how much I traveled during the first 

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,123
h moments of my journey. 
What about between time h and time 2h, 

17
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:28,670
right? 
How far did I travel there? 

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,813
Well, the time that elapsed was h units 
of time. 

19
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:35,200
And how fast was I going? 
Well, I could use v of h. 

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,738
My velocity of time h as a good 
approximation for my velocity over that 

21
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:42,621
time period, right? 
My velocity is not necessarily constant. 

22
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:46,397
But this is standing in for a reasonable 
approximation and my velocity is not 

23
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,017
changing too rapidly. 
All right. 

24
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:53,648
This is how far I traveled, right? 
Time times velocity is distance. 

25
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,210
All right? 
Now how far did I travel between, say 

26
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,224
time 2h and time 3h. 
Well, again, how long was I traveling for 

27
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:03,416
h units of time? 
And how fast was I going? 

28
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:08,232
v 2h is a reasonable approximation for my 
velocity during that time period. 

29
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:12,901
And of course this keeps on going, right? 
But what do I get if I add all of these 

30
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,048
things up? 
Right? 

31
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:20,034
What I'm getting is a Riemann sum. 
And if I keep on adding these things up 

32
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:24,907
until I get, you know, all the way to, to 
b, right? 

33
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:29,227
What I'm writing down is the 
approximation for this interval of a 

34
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:34,747
particular Riemann sum which approximates 
this integral and in the limit as h goes 

35
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:41,077
to zero, that Riemann sum will compute 
this integral. 

36
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:47,450
So, summarizing that, the accumulation 
function of velocity, is displacement. 

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,950
And what's the derivative of 
displacement? 

38
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,933
It's velocity, right? 
The derivative of my accumulation 

39
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:57,122
function in this specific case where the 
accumulation function is the accumulation 

40
00:02:57,122 --> 00:03:00,957
function for velocity, right, the 
derivative of that accumulation function 

41
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:05,180
is the thing that I'm integrating, 
velocity. 

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,017
That's the fundamental theorem of 
calculus. 

43
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:12,109
Or in symbols, you know, the accumulation 
function, which is[INAUDIBLE] 

44
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,790
displacement, is the interval from zero 
to b of my velocity. 

45
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,050
And what I'm asking is, how is that 
changing, right? 

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,230
If that's my displacement when I travel 
from times 0 to times b, right? 

47
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,260
What is the derivative with respect to 
the time that I've been traveling? 

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,120
The derivative of displacement is 
velocity. 

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,670
So physically, differentiating the 
accumulation function of velocity is to 

50
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,698
differentiate displacement. 
It's to ask for the rate of change in my 

51
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:51,424
position, which is velocity, which is the 
integrand. 

52
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:59,873
It's the fundamental theorem of calculus 
just wrapped up in physical clothing.
