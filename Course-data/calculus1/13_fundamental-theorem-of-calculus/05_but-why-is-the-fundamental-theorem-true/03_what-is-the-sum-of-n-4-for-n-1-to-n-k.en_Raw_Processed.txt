lets find sum th powers 
in particular, i want to calculate 
sum, n goes to k, n to th 
playing this analogy, i could think 
this problem way that id 
approach an integration problem 
i try to antidifference n to 
th 
i try to find a list numbers, 
whose successive differences n to 
fourth, try to find a list 
numbers whose differences n to 
th 
lets try to find lists 
numbers differences 
so a first example lets take a look 
say n to th, lets look 
th power 
so th is , to th is , 
to th is , to th is , 
to th is to tenth 
thats 
five to th is so 
so thats lists th powers 
now, lets try to find differences 
between subsequent numbers in this list 
so difference between is 
difference between is 
difference between is 
difference between , is 
difference between , 
, is so forth 
maybe so helpful to see 
specific numbers 
lets try to write a formula 
this 
so ill write differences, between 
th powers 
well thats n to th minus 
previous th power, so minus n minus to 
th 
i could expand this 
i could take n to th minus this thing 
expanded id get n to th is 
n to th will cancel minus n 
cubed plus n squared minus n plus 
right, plus comes 
subtracting a minus to th 
okay, so that formula there gives 
green numbers, differences in 
th powers 
im going to play kind game 
a different list numbers 
lets try to find differences in 
list say th powers, well that will 
th power n, minus fourth 
power pervious number n minus 
i expand this n to 
th minus, theres an n to fourth 
that cancels 
so highest power that survives is an 
n cubed term a coefficient 
minus n squared plus n minus 
so this formula tells differences 
between subsequent th powers 
i want to combine those, to get 
somehting a difference n to 
th 
okay, i going to that 
well, heres something i could to make 
a little bit easier to see whats 
going 
instead looking differences between 
th powers, i look differences 
between th th power 
so i, that is effect dividing 
numbers five 
since coefficients except 
last one multiples five, 
thatll make that formula look a little 
bit nicer 
i could thing n 
to th 
instead looking th powers, i could 
look quarter fourth powers, 
id effect dividing 
coefficients four 
let write you know, what, 
weve got here, kind summarize 
resulting formulas 
so, differences between n to th 
, well, according to this that will 
n to th minus n cubed plus n 
squared minus n plus a th 
i get a similar kind formula 
looking differences n to th 

this divided that will give 
an n, cubed minus halves squared 
plus n minus a quarter 
well, lets try to combine 
two 
how, exactly, i want to combine 

well, deal is that ive got an n to 
th here, thats really i 
want end this process 
i want something differences n 
to th, im trying to 
antidifference n to th 
ive got a minus n cubed 
ive got an n cubed here 
so if i took this added two copies 
this, id in pretty good shape 
so would i get in that case 
ill looking differences n 
to th plus two copies n to 
th 
that would give an n to th 
n cubed term would go away 
id get a minus n squared, ive 
got a n squared minus two copies 
three halves n squared 
i get a plus n, ive got 
minus n plus two copies n 
a th minus copies a th 
will give minus tenths 
i could try to get rid that n squared 
term adding differences n 
cubed 
that work 
well, if you calculate differences 
list numbers n cubed 
you end getting, n squared minus n, 
plus a third 
so, if i take this add this, thatll 
get rid this n squared term 
right 
so im going to look differences 
n to th plus two copies 
n to th plus n cubed , 
im left an n to fourth 
n squared anymore 
plus n minus n also cancels, 
ive got minus three tenths plus a third, 
that ends plus th 
i get rid th 
term 
i that 
well, look differences list 
numbers n , thats 
th, right 
this list numbers, number in that 
list differs th compared to 
previous number in list 
so if i take this subtract n , 
differences in that list 
exactly n to th, right 
i mean that i take d n to 
th plus n to th 
plus n to rd minus n 
i got n to th plus a th 
minus a th im left is 
n to th 
so in light this, i 
know right know 
taking differences between a list 
numbers, this accumulation function, 
adding first k numbers 
list 
inverse operations, right 
this is discreet version 
fundamental theorem calculus 
in this particular case, differences 
between numbers give you th 
power 
so if i sum th powers i get this, 
least to constant 
i to worry that 
constant 
constant is zero, we check 

heres a sum n equals to 
n to th 
i plug in value k 
that i like, since this constant c 
doesnt depend upon k 
i figure that constant is 
looking k equals 
so, this is 
side, ive got i 
get i plug in k equals 
is, th plus times th, 
plus, you know, to rd 
so plus a rd minus a th, plus that 
constant c that doesnt depend upon k 

a th plus a half plus a third minus 
a th is 
so ive got equals plus c 
so that means c equals 
that tells formula then, 
sum fourh powers is 
this, that constant is 
this whole process is really analogous to 
fundamental theorem calculus 
we use it, right 
in this example im antidifferencing n to 
th in order to sum n to th 
in way that if i to 
antidifferentiate x to fourth, that 
would help to integrate x to th, 
right 
this analogy runs really deep
