lets think fundamental theorem 
calculus physically 
lets define function v rule 
that v is velocity time 
physically, accumulation 
function velocity mean 
well that accumulation function, 
remember, is say, integral to 
b, v dt 
this is really distance, that 
ive traveled time to time b 
this also makes sense we think back 
to riemann sums 
would riemann sum say 
if i think far i traveled 
a short time period, say, between time 
zero time h small number h, 
right 
far i travel that time 
period 
well, i traveled that small time 
period h i traveling a speed 
of, i mean, you know, a velocity time 
zero, say, is a good approximation 
i imagine velocity didnt change 
much this time period 
so, thats a pretty good approximation 
much i traveled first 
h moments journey 
between time h time h, 
right 
far i travel there 
well, time that elapsed h units 
time 
fast i going 
well, i could use v h 
velocity time h a good 
approximation velocity that 
time period, right 
velocity is necessarily constant 
this is standing in a reasonable 
approximation velocity is 
changing rapidly 
right 
this is far i traveled, right 
time times velocity is distance 
right 
far i travel between, say 
time h time h 
well, again, long i traveling 
h units time 
fast i going 
v h is a reasonable approximation 
velocity that time period 
course this keeps going, right 
i get if i add 
things 
right 
im getting is a riemann sum 
if i keep adding things 
until i get, you know, way to, to 
b, right 
im writing is 
approximation this interval a 
particular riemann sum approximates 
this integral in limit h goes 
to zero, that riemann sum will compute 
this integral 
so, summarizing that, accumulation 
function velocity, is displacement 
whats derivative 
displacement 
velocity, right 
derivative accumulation 
function in this specific case 
accumulation function is accumulation 
function velocity, right, 
derivative that accumulation function 
is thing that im integrating, 
velocity 
thats fundamental theorem 
calculus 
in symbols, you know, accumulation 
function, isinaudible 
displacement, is interval zero 
to b velocity 
im asking is, is that 
changing, right 
if thats displacement i travel 
times to times b, right 
is derivative respect to 
time that ive traveling 
derivative displacement is 
velocity 
so physically, differentiating 
accumulation function velocity is to 
differentiate displacement 
to ask rate change in 
position, is velocity, is 
integrand
