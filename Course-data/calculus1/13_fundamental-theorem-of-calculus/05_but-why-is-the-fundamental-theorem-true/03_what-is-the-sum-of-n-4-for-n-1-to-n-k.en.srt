1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:05,034
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:11,480
Let's find the sum of the 4th powers. 
In particular, I want to calculate the 

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,045
sum, n goes from 1 to k, of n to the 4th. 
Playing with this analogy, I could think 

4
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:22,686
about this problem the same way that I'd 
approach an integration problem. 

5
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:26,393
I should try to antidifference n to the 
4th. 

6
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:30,221
I should try to find a list of numbers, 
whose successive differences are n to the 

7
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:33,643
fourth, just try to find a list of 
numbers whose differences are n to the 

8
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:37,396
4th. 
Let's just try to find some lists of 

9
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:42,170
numbers and their differences. 
So as a first example let's take a look 

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,964
at say n to the 5th, and let's look at 
the 5th power. 

11
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:52,788
So 0 the 5th is 0, 1 to the 5th is 1, 2 
to the 5th is 32, 3 to the 5th is 243, 4 

12
00:00:52,788 --> 00:01:01,000
to the 5th is the same as 2 to the tenth 
that's 1024. 

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,550
Five to the 5th is 3125 and so on. 
So that's just lists of of 5th powers. 

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,240
Now, let's try to find the differences 
between subsequent numbers in this list. 

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,370
So the difference between 1 and 0 is 1. 
The difference between 32 and 1 is 31. 

16
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:29,022
The difference between 243 and 32 is 211. 
The difference between 1,024 and 243 is 

17
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:35,695
781. 
And the difference between 1,024 and 

18
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:42,575
3,125 is 2101 and so forth. 
Now it's maybe not so helpful just to see 

19
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,840
specific numbers. 
Let's try to write down a formula for 

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,838
this. 
So I'll write the differences, between 

21
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:51,667
the 5th powers. 
Well that's n to the 5th minus the 

22
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:56,389
previous 5th power, so minus n minus 1 to 
the 4th. 

23
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:02,301
And then I could expand this out. 
I could take n to 5th minus this thing 

24
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:08,378
expanded and I'd get 5 n to the 4th is 
the n to the 5th will cancel minus 10 n 

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:17,486
cubed plus 10 n squared minus 5 n plus 1. 
Right, and the plus 1 comes from 

26
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:22,202
subtracting a minus 1 to the 5th. 
Okay, so that formula there gives these 

27
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:26,168
green numbers, it's the differences in 
the 5th powers. 

28
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm going to play the same kind of game 
for a different list of numbers. 

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,926
Let's try to find the differences in the 
list of say 4th powers, well that will be 

30
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:38,257
the 4th power of n, minus the fourth 
power of the pervious number of n minus 

31
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:43,856
1. 
And again I can expand this out and n to 

32
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:48,783
the 4th minus, there's an n to the fourth 
that cancels. 

33
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:53,247
So the highest power that survives is an 
n cubed term with a coefficient of 4 

34
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:59,646
minus 6 n squared plus 4 n minus 1. 
So this formula tells me the differences 

35
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:04,527
between subsequent 4th powers. 
Now I want to combine those, to get 

36
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:08,222
somehting with a difference of n to the 
4th. 

37
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,714
Okay, but how am I going to do that? 
Well, here's something I could do to make 

38
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:13,680
it a little bit easier to see what's 
going on. 

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,300
Instead of looking at differences between 
5th powers, I can look at the differences 

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,408
between 1 5th of 5th power. 
So I, that is the effect of dividing all 

41
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:27,411
these numbers by five. 
And since all these coefficients except 

42
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,856
for the last one are multiples of five, 
that'll make that formula look a little 

43
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:34,615
bit nicer. 
And I could do the same thing with with n 

44
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,110
to the 4th. 
Instead of looking at 4th powers, I could 

45
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,205
look at 1 quarter of fourth powers, and 
I'd have the effect of dividing all of 

46
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:47,986
these coefficients by by four. 
Let me just write down you know, what, 

47
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:52,138
what we've got here, kind of summarize 
the resulting formulas. 

48
00:03:52,138 --> 00:04:00,647
So, the differences between n to the 5th 
over 5, well, according to this that will 

49
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:11,360
be n to the 4th minus 2 n cubed plus 2 n 
squared minus n plus a 5th. 

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,490
And I get a similar kind of formula for 
looking at differences of n to the 4th 

51
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:24,688
over 4. 
It's this divided by 4 and that will give 

52
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:32,820
me an n, cubed minus 3 halves and squared 
plus n minus a quarter. 

53
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,328
Well, let's just try to combine those 
two. 

54
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,836
But how, exactly, do I want to combine 
them? 

55
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:41,136
Well, the deal is that I've got an n to 
he 4th here, and that's really what I 

56
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:45,855
want at the end of this process. 
I want something with the differences n 

57
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:49,709
to the 4th, because I'm trying to 
antidifference n to the 4th. 

58
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:53,920
And I've got a minus 2n cubed. 
And I've just got an n cubed here. 

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,420
So if I took this and added two copies of 
this, I'd be in pretty good shape. 

60
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,460
So what would I get in that case? 
I'll be looking at the differences of n 

61
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,060
to the 5th over 5 plus two copies of n to 
the 4th over 4. 

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,580
And that would give me an n to the 4th. 
The n cubed term would go away. 

63
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,314
I'd get a minus n squared, because I've 
got a 2n squared minus two copies of 

64
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:27,960
three halves n squared. 
And then I get a plus n, because I've got 

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,744
minus n plus two copies of n. 
And then a 5th minus 2 copies of a 4th 

66
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:42,425
will give me minus 3 tenths. 
I could try to get rid of that n squared 

67
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:47,387
term by adding up on the differences of n 
cubed. 

68
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:52,539
Why does that work? 
Well, if you calculate the differences 

69
00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:02,251
for the list of numbers n cubed over 3. 
you end up getting, n squared minus n, 

70
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:07,882
plus a third. 
So, if I take this and add this, that'll 

71
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:11,200
get rid of this n squared term. 
Right? 

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,019
So I'm going to look at the differences 
of n to the 5th over 5 plus two copies of 

73
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:23,668
n to the 4th over 4 plus n cubed over 3, 
and I'm left with an n to the fourth. 

74
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:30,407
No more n squared anymore. 
The plus n minus n also cancels, and then 

75
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:38,016
I've got minus three tenths plus a third, 
and that ends up being plus 1 30th. 

76
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:38,950
Now I can get rid of the 1 over 30th 
term. 

77
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,681
Now how do I do that? 
Well, look at the differences of the list 

78
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:53,110
of numbers n over 30, and that's just 1 
30th, right. 

79
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,750
This list of numbers, each number in that 
list differs by 1 30th compared to the 

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,490
previous number in the list. 
So if I take this and subtract n over 30, 

81
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,859
then the differences in that list are 
exactly n to the 4th, right? 

82
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:12,274
By which I mean that I take d of n to the 
5th over 5 plus 2 n to the 4th over 4 

83
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:20,818
plus n to the 3rd over 3 minus n over 30. 
And then I got n to the 4th plus a 30th 

84
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:26,340
minus a 30th and what I'm left with is 
just n to the 4th. 

85
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,410
So in light of all of this, What do I 
know right know? 

86
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,363
Taking differences between a list of 
numbers, and this accumulation function, 

87
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:37,800
adding up the first k numbers on the 
list. 

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,752
Those are inverse operations, right? 
This is the discreet version of the 

89
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:46,950
fundamental theorem of calculus. 
In this particular case, the differences 

90
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,660
between these numbers give you the 4th 
power. 

91
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,610
So if I sum the 4th powers I get this, at 
least up to some constant. 

92
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,840
Now I just have to worry about that 
constant. 

93
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,370
But then constant is zero, we can check 
it. 

94
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,000
Here's a sum for n equals 1 just to 1 of 
n to the 4th. 

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,192
And I can just plug in any value of K 
that I like, since this constant C 

96
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:15,433
doesn't depend upon K. 
I can figure out what that constant is by 

97
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:20,450
looking at when K equals 1. 
So, this is just 1. 

98
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,050
But on the other side, I've got what I 
get when I plug in k equals 1. 

99
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,930
Which is, 1 5th plus 2 times the 4th, 
plus, you know, 1 to the 3rd over 3. 

100
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,898
So plus a 3rd minus a 30th, plus that 
constant c that doesn't depend upon k at 

101
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,716
all. 
But a 5th plus a half plus a third minus 

102
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:43,336
a 30th is 1. 
So I've got 1 equals 1 plus C. 

103
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:48,374
So that means C equals 0. 
And that tells me what the formula then, 

104
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:53,512
for the sum of the 4fourh powers is. 
It's just this, and that constant is just 

105
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:56,180
0. 
This whole process is really analogous to 

106
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,620
the fundamental theorem of calculus and 
how we use it, right. 

107
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,130
In this example I'm antidifferencing n to 
the 4th in order to sum n to the 4th. 

108
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,024
In the same way that if I were to 
antidifferentiate x to the fourth, that 

109
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:14,210
would help me to integrate x to the 4th, 
right. 

110
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:24,033
This analogy runs really deep.
