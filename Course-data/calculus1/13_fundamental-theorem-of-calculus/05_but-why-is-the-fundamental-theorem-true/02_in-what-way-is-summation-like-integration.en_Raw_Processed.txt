ive trying to sell you an 
analogy 
analogy is that integration is a 
whole lot like summation 
weve also seen fundamental 
theorem calculus, fundamental 
theorem calculus tells us that 
integration practically amounts to 
antidifferentiation 
so fundamental theorem 
calculus fit this analogy 
well heres analogy square 
ive got integrating differentiating 
integrating is like summing 
so whats thing thats like 
differentiating discrete 
world 
im claiming differencing 
so 
well, lets suppose that ive got a list 
numbers 
made list numbers is something easy 
like one, two, three, four, five, 
could creative 
lets suppose this is list 
numbers 
accumulation function amounts to 
adding numbers 
so in this case, itd plus , plus 
, plus , plus , plus , so 
forth 
difference operator, like 
differentiation, difference 
operator amounts to writing a new 
list 
list differences between success 
numbers 
so in this case if i this list 
numbers, i could write 
differences between subsequent 
numbers in that list 
minus is , minus is , six minus 
is , minus is , minus is 
, so forth 
if i to look list 
differences in list 
accumulation function, id get back 
original list that i started 
really worth repeating 
right 
taking differences between sum 
first k numbers in original list 
sum first k minus numbers in 
original list 
gives back original list 
numbers 
this is an analogous to statement 
calculus 
that if i take derivative 
accumulation function, i give back 
original function 
mathematics isnt isolated 
facts, really analogies 
between ideas 
like in literature 
metaphor plays an important role
