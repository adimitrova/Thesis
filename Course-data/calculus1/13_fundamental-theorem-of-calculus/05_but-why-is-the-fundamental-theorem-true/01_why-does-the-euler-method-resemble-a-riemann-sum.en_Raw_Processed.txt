music 
remember back to good old days 
we approximating antiderivatives 
using eulers method 
im going to started 
function little f i wanted to 
numerically approximate a function big f, 
whose derivative little f 
maybe i know big fs value is 
exactly , i want to numerically 
approximate big f values away 
we repeated linear 
approximation 
i pick tiny h, i 
approximated big f h 
well, i know big f big fs 
derivative is little f 
so approximation big f h is 
value big f plus h times 
derivative big f 
well, is this 
value big f is exactly equal 
to 
and, i got plus h times, 
derivative big f is little f 
so times little f 
so i use this approximation 
big f h 
i 
so, i want to approximate big f h 
well thats big f h approximately 
i mean im writing equals i really 
mean approximately 
big f h plus h times derivative 
big f h, right 
i start f h im going to wiggle 
h derivative is encoding 
least approximately, much 
output change a given input 
change 
this is i get another 
linear approximation 
ive already got an approximation 
big f h 
h times f zero 
so ill use that value big f 
h 
h times f plus h times 
i know f prime h 
i know big fs derivative is little f 
so i use that here 
so this is little f 
h, so this is an approximation big 
f h 
i a third time 
so this is method euler, 
right 
i want to approximate big f h 
well thatll big f h, plus 
much i wiggled by, is h times 
derivative ff big f h 
i know 
well, ive already got an approximation 
big f h, right here 
so, h times little f plus h 
times little f h plus h times, 
whats derivative big f h 
well, big fs derivative is little f 
so i use that here 
this will little f h 
i keep going 
i want to approximate big f h, 
right 
i repeating this process 
itll h times f plus h times f 
h 
plus h times f h, will keep 
going until i get to h times f h 
now, that look like 
this looks like a riemann sum, right, 
i would want to choose h to 
small 
so, really, if i wanted to approximate 
big f x using method euler id 
using smaller smaller values h 
calculating like this, 
would i calculating 
id calculating integral 
to x function, right, little f 
td, dt 
i know accumulation 
functions 
well, i know that derivative 
accumulation function, right, is 
original function 
thats exactly i want, right 
i mean, this is saying that 
derivative big f is little f 
so eulers method amounts to calculating 
a riemanns sum 
riemanns sum approximates an 
integral, accumulation function, 
accumulation function is an 
antiderivative 
makes sense 
right 
things that appear different 
really thing 
eulers method gives another 
perspective fundamental 
theorem calculus true
