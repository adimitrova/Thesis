let
's
find
the
area
between
two
parabolas
.
i
want
to
find
the
area
between
the
graph
y
equals
x
squared
and
the
graph
of
y
equals
1
minus
x
squared
.
as
usual
let
's
start
by
graphing
.
well
here
's
my
coordinate
plane
.
i
'll
draw
a
graph
of
y
equals
x
squared
.
and
the
other
curve
is
y
equals
1
minus
x
squared
,
so
i
'll
draw
a
downward-facing
parabola
.
there
's
the
one
side
of
it
and
there
's
the
other
side
of
it
.
i
'll
draw
some
rectangles
to
get
an
idea
about
what
riemann
sum
i
really
want
to
take
the
limit
of
.
so
it
's
really
the
area
inside
here
that
i
want
to
calculate
.
draw
some
some
rectangles
then
for
the
for
the
riemann
sum
.
that
would
approximate
that
area
.
right
,
so
there
's
some
rectangles
for
the
the
riemann
sum
that
would
approximate
the
area
in
there
.
and
then
i
can
write
down
the
heights
and
the
widths
of
one
of
those
rectangles
.
let
's
take
a
look
and
say
this
rectangle
here
.
well
,
what
's
the
width
of
that
rectangle
,
will
be
real
thin
,
so
i
'll
call
the
width
dx
.
and
what
's
the
height
of
that
rectangle
.
well
the
top
of
that
rectangle
is
on
the
curve
1
minus
x
squared
and
the
bottom
of
that
rectangle
was
on
the
curve
x
squared
.
so
if
we
take
the
top
coordinate
minus
the
bottom
coordinate
,
that
will
give
me
the
height
of
this
rectangle
.
the
top
coordinate
is
1
minus
x
squared
.
the
bottom
y
coordinate
is
just
x
squared
.
so
this
quantity
is
giving
you
the
height
of
this
rectangle
.
oh
,
now
i
can
write
down
the
integral
.
so
i
know
the
height
and
the
width
of
these
rectangles
so
the
thing
i
want
to
add
up
are
the
areas
of
those
little
rectangles
.
so
i
want
to
integrate
the
height
.
1
minus
,
this
is
2x
squared
,
times
the
width
,
dx
.
but
i
'm
trying
to
integrate
from
where
to
where
,
right
?
what
are
the
possible
x
values
in
this
region
?
well
,
if
we
think
about
exactly
where
these
two
curves
cross
,
right
?
what
's
the
x
coordinate
where
these
curves
cross
?
and
this
coordinate
here
is
minus
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
and
this
coordinate
is
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
so
i
'm
going
to
be
integrating
to
compute
the
area
from
x
equals
negative
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
up
to
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
and
it
's
this
integral
that
'll
calculate
the
area
in
between
those
two
curves
.
i
can
use
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
to
evaluate
this
integral
.
let
's
find
an
antiderivative
.
so
what
's
an
antiderivative
of
1
,
well
x
is
an
antiderivative
of
1.
what
's
an
antiderivative
of
2
x
squared
,
well
2
x
to
the
3rd
over
3
differentiates
to
2
x
squared
.
and
i
'm
looking
for
an
antiderivative
of
a
difference
,
so
it
'll
be
the
difference
of
antiderivatives
.
now
i
'll
evaluate
my
antiderivative
at
the
right
and
left
endpoints
.
right
,
so
i
have
to
evaluate
my
antiderivative
at
the
end
points
,
which
are
1
over
the
square
root
2
and
minus
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
and
then
take
the
difference
.
so
what
do
i
get
when
i
plug
in
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
i
get
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
minus
2
times
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
to
the
third
divided
by
3.
so
this
is
what
i
get
when
i
plug
in
x
equals
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
into
my
antiderivative
.
and
i
subtract
what
i
get
when
i
plug
in
negative
that
,
which
is
negative
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
,
minus
2
times
negative
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
cubed
,
all
over
3.
i
can
simplify
this
a
bit
.
well
,
first
off
,
i
've
got
a
quantity
minus
negative
that
same
quantity
.
that
's
just
two
copies
of
this
same
quantity
.
now
i
can
keep
calculating
this
and
try
to
simplify
this
even
a
little
bit
further
.
now
let
's
keep
going
.
so
what
do
i
have
here
?
well
it
's
2
times
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
,
minus
2.
and
here
i
've
got
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
to
the
3rd
power
.
so
i
could
write
that
as
a
half
.
times
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
that
's
really
3
copies
of
the
square
root
of
2
divided
by
3.
okay
.
but
,
2
times
1/2
,
alright
,
cancels
.
and
then
i
've
got
a
common
factor
of
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
so
i
could
,
pull
out
that
common
factor
of
1
over
the
square
root
of
2.
and
when
i
pull
that
out
i
've
got
a
one
there
minus
a
third
is
left
.
now
2
times
1
over
the
square
root
of
2
,
that
's
just
the
square
root
of
2
and
1
minus
a
third
well
that
's
really
2
3rds
,
so
what
's
left
all
over
here
is
the
square
root
of
2.
times
2
3rds
,
this
is
the
value
of
the
integral
and
also
then
,
the
area
between
those
two
curves
.
before
committing
to
this
as
my
final
answer
,
i
should
check
to
see
that
the
answer
's
somewhat
reasonable
.
well
if
we
numerically
approximate
this
,
this
is
about
0.94.
so
is
a
bit
less
than
one
square
unit
a
reasonable
answer
?
well
the
region
that
we
're
interested
in
fits
inside
a
rectangle
of
height
1
,
and
width
the
square
root
of
2
units
.
the
area
of
this
rectangle
is
about
1.41
square
units
.
and
the
area
of
the
region
we
just
calculated
to
be
about
0.94
square
units
,
right
?
this
region
inside
here
.
and
it
's
pretty
reasonable
.
i
mean
,
you
know
?
it
looks
like
.
if
this
thing
is
about
1.41
square
units
it
's
not
unreasonable
to
think
that
this
is
a
little
bit
less
than
1
square
unit
in
this
curved
region
,
here
.
yea
,
we
're
really
finding
answers
that
accord
with
our
geometric
intuition
.
