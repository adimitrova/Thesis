1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,134
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:10,374
Let's think a bit, about circles. 
Let's think about the function little f 

3
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:14,624
of x equals the square root of 1 minus x 
squared. 

4
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:20,290
What do we get if we graph that function? 
We draw my coordinate axes, right. 

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,042
And I'm trying to graph the function. 
y equals the square root of 1 minus x 

6
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:30,408
squared and yeah, when I graph that, I 
get a semi-circle. 

7
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:33,710
Now, we can compute this integral 
geometrically. 

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,687
Well, let's think about the integral from 
0 to 1 of the square root of 1 minus x 

9
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:44,597
squared dx, right? 
That just calculates the area Inside this 

10
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:51,750
quarter circle, and what's that area? 
Well, the whole unit circle has area pi. 

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,190
So that quarter circle has area pi over 
4. 

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,080
This is a geometric calculation of an 
integral. 

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,210
We can also look at the accumulation 
function. 

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,992
Well here's a zoomed in copy of the graph 
of that semi circle and here's 0 and 

15
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:10,786
here's t. 
So this area in here is exactly what the 

16
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:15,430
accumulation function calculates. 
It's the integral from 0 to t. 

17
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,970
Of the square root of 1 minus x squared 
right, that's this graph, d x. 

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,562
Now my claim is that, that accumulation 
function can be written like this. 

19
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:28,786
That, that integral is equal to t times 
the square root of 1 minus t squared all 

20
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:33,460
over 2 plus the arc sin of t over 2. 
We can work this out in a couple 

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,182
different ways. 
One way just involves differenciating. 

22
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:41,088
So I'm going to differentiate this side 
and get, I hope, the square root of 1 

23
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:45,120
minus t squared, alright, that will be a 
proof that an anti-derivative of the 

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,050
square root of 1 minus x squared is this. 
So that's with t's replaced with x's. 

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,003
Okay so let's try it. 
Let's see if we can, if we can really 

26
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:58,006
pull that off. 
So so let me just write down what I'm 

27
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:02,338
trying to show. 
I'm trying to differentiate this whole 

28
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:06,430
thing. 
So t times the square root of 1 minus t 

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,140
squared over 2, plus the arc sin of t 
over 2. 

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,468
And that's differentiating a sum. 
So I just had to differentiate this and 

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:20,170
add it to the derivative of this. 
And this first term is a product. 

32
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,940
It's the t times the square root of 1 
minus t squared over 2. 

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,200
So I'm going to differentiate that 
product using the product rule. 

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,400
So it's the derivative of t, which is 
just 1 times the second thing. 

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,984
Or the square root of 1 minus t squared 
over 2. 

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,309
Plus the first thing t times the 
deriveter of the second thing alright d 

37
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:49,208
dt the squared of 1 minus t squared over 
2 alright so that's the deriveter of this 

38
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:53,468
first term plus the deriveter of[UNKNOWN] 
t over 2 well the deriveter of 

39
00:02:53,468 --> 00:03:02,560
art[UNKNOWN] Is 1 over the square root of 
1 minus t squared, but then it's over 2. 

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,320
So I'll put a 2 there. 
Okay, so I'm making some progress. 

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,776
I've still got to differentiate the 
squared of 1 minus t squared over 2 so, 

42
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:13,890
let's just, let's just keep going. 
So this first term is looking really 

43
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,615
great. 
This is the square-root of of one minus 

44
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:20,284
t-squared, over two. 
And, of course, I'm trying to get the 

45
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:25,496
square-root of one minus t-squared. 
So that's, that's looking pretty good. 

46
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,236
Plus t times, now what's the derivative 
of this square-root? 

47
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:33,152
Well, I'll put the over-two here. 
So I just need to differentiate the 

48
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:36,825
square-root of minus t-squared. 
And that's one over. 

49
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:41,708
2 times the square root of 1 minus T 
squared. 

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,980
And then it's times the derivative of the 
inside function. 

51
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,195
And the derivative of 1 minus T squared 
is minus 2T. 

52
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:51,705
All right, so that's the derivative of 
the square root of 1 minus T squared over 

53
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,243
2. 
The over 2 is there, and that's the 

54
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,748
derivative of just the square root of 1 
minus T squared. 

55
00:03:57,748 --> 00:04:02,228
And I'll just add the derivative arc sign 
t, one over two the square root of one 

56
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:07,187
minus t squared. 
Okay, now I can simplify this a bit. 

57
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:11,475
Right, what do I have here? 
Well, I've got a minus two here and a two 

58
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:14,616
there. 
So those will cancel and what I'm going 

59
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:20,787
to be left with here is , 
The square root of 1 minus t squared over 

60
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:26,410
2. 
Minus t squared, over 2 times the square 

61
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,343
root of 1 minus t squared. 
That's this whole second term, plus 1 

62
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:37,519
over 2 times the square root of 1 minus t 
squared. 

63
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,710
Now I'm going to combine these last two 
terms, all right? 

64
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,976
This is equal to what? 
Well, I'll put 1 minus t squared over 

65
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:56,002
this common denominator. 
So I've got this first term, the square 

66
00:04:56,002 --> 00:05:01,189
root of 1 minus t squared over 2 Plus 1 
minus t squared over that common 

67
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:08,870
denominator of 2 times the square root of 
1 minus t squared. 

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,960
Now I've got something divided by the 
square root of the same thing. 

69
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,876
So I could replace this. 
With, well, the first term, 1 minus t 

70
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:21,356
squared over 2 plus, this is something 
over the square root of the same thing, 

71
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:26,404
so the square root of 1 minus t squared 
over 2. 

72
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:31,488
Now I've got something over 2 plus 
something over 2, that's just the square 

73
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:38,142
root of 1 minus t squared, and indeed We 
have made it to our goal. 

74
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:42,750
I started by wanting to differentiate 
this expression and I ended up with the 

75
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,565
sqaure of 1 minus t squared. 
The second method is a bit more 

76
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:51,522
geometric. 
So I want to find geometrically the area 

77
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:55,571
in here. 
And I can break that region up by drawing 

78
00:05:55,571 --> 00:06:01,918
this line, so that I've got this circular 
sector and this triangle. 

79
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,570
Now what's the area of the triangle 
piece? 

80
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,980
Well, the height of that triangle is the 
square root of 1 minus t-squared, right. 

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,750
The base is length t, and this hypotenuse 
is length 1. 

82
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,182
So by the pythagorean theorem the height 
of that triangle is the square root of 1 

83
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:21,510
minus t squared and that means the area 
of this triangle is its base t times its 

84
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,360
height the square root of 1 minus t 
squared divided by 2. 

85
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,580
So that's the area of this triangle, 
What's the area of the circular sector? 

86
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,927
Well, I've got an angle here which is 
theta and by a bit of geometry that angle 

87
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:42,770
is the same as that angle up there. 
This length here is t, right. 

88
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,014
We're going to need that in a minute. 
So if I've got a circular sector with a 

89
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:55,260
radius 1 and a angle here, theta, that 
area is theta over 2. 

90
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,504
This length is t. 
So that means that I know a formula for 

91
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:03,367
theta in terms of t. 
Theta is arcsine t, right, because, you 

92
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:08,512
know, really, sine theta is t. 
And that means instead of writing theta 

93
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,806
over two for that area, I could write the 
area of that circular sector to be 

94
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:16,711
arcsine t over two. 
So the total area here is arc sin t over 

95
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:20,999
2 plus t times the square root of 1 minus 
t squared over 2. 

96
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,135
Alright? 
And that's exactly what I'm claiming in 

97
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:28,568
the accumulation function. 
This term is calculating the area of that 

98
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:31,322
triangle. 
And this term is calculating the area of 

99
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:35,084
that circular sector. 
Now what happens if we evaluate the 

100
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:39,113
accumilation function at 1. 
So what I would be calculating is the 

101
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:44,258
interval from 0 to 1 of the square root 
of 1 minus x squared dx. 

102
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:48,806
And that's what I get when I just plug in 
t equals 1 here. 

103
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:53,920
So 1 times the square root of 1 minus 1 
squared over 2, 0. 

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,080
Plus arc sign of 1 over 2 well that term 
is 0 and arc sign of 1 is pie over 2, so 

105
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,326
I've got pie over 2 over 2 that is just 
pie over 4 which is you know really the 

106
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:09,744
area of a quarter circle these pieces are 
coming together We can compute the 

107
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:20,240
accumulation function just by pure 
geometry or some trigonometry. 

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,270
We can verify that its derivative really 
is the square root of 1 minus x squared. 

109
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,920
And then we can recover the area of a 
semi circle this way as well, right. 

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:39,073
No mathematical fact is an island.
