lets think a bit, circles 
lets think function little f 
x equals square root minus x 
squared 
we get if we graph that function 
we draw coordinate axes, right 
im trying to graph function 
y equals square root minus x 
squared yeah, i graph that, i 
get a semicircle 
now, we compute this integral 
geometrically 
well, lets think integral 
to square root minus x 
squared dx, right 
that calculates area inside this 
quarter circle, whats that area 
well, whole unit circle area pi 
so that quarter circle area pi 
this is a geometric calculation an 
integral 
we also look accumulation 
function 
well heres a zoomed in copy graph 
that semi circle heres 
heres 
so this area in here is exactly 
accumulation function calculates 
integral to 
square root minus x squared 
right, thats this graph, d x 
claim is that, that accumulation 
function written like this 
that, that integral is equal to times 
square root minus squared 
plus arc sin 
we work this in a couple 
different ways 
one way involves differenciating 
so im going to differentiate this side 
get, i hope, square root 
minus squared, alright, that will a 
proof that an antiderivative 
square root minus x squared is this 
so thats ts replaced xs 
okay so lets try 
lets see if we can, if we really 
pull that 
so so let write im 
trying to show 
im trying to differentiate this whole 
thing 
so times square root minus 
squared , plus arc sin 

thats differentiating a sum 
so i to differentiate this 
add to derivative this 
this first term is a product 
times square root 
minus squared 
so im going to differentiate that 
product using product rule 
so derivative t, is 
times second thing 
square root minus squared 

plus first thing times 
deriveter second thing alright d 
dt squared minus squared 
alright so thats deriveter this 
first term plus deriveter ofunknown 
well deriveter 
artunknown is square root 
minus squared, 
so ill put a there 
okay, so im making progress 
ive still got to differentiate 
squared minus squared so, 
lets just, lets keep going 
so this first term is looking really 
great 
this is squareroot one minus 
tsquared, two 
and, course, im trying to get 
squareroot one minus tsquared 
so thats, thats looking pretty good 
plus times, whats derivative 
this squareroot 
well, ill put overtwo here 
so i need to differentiate 
squareroot minus tsquared 
thats one 
times square root minus 
squared 
times derivative 
inside function 
derivative minus squared 
is minus 
right, so thats derivative 
square root minus squared 
is there, thats 
derivative square root 
minus squared 
ill add derivative arc sign 
t, one two square root one 
minus squared 
okay, i simplify this a bit 
right, i here 
well, ive got a minus two here a two 
there 
so will cancel im going 
to left here is , 
square root minus squared 
minus squared, times square 
root minus squared 
thats this whole second term, plus 
times square root minus 
squared 
im going to combine last two 
terms, right 
this is equal to 
well, ill put minus squared 
this common denominator 
so ive got this first term, square 
root minus squared plus 
minus squared that common 
denominator times square root 
minus squared 
ive got something divided 
square root thing 
so i could replace this 
with, well, first term, minus 
squared plus, this is something 
square root thing, 
so square root minus squared 

ive got something plus 
something , thats square 
root minus squared, indeed we 
made to goal 
i started wanting to differentiate 
this expression i ended 
sqaure minus squared 
second method is a bit 
geometric 
so i want to find geometrically area 
in here 
i break that region drawing 
this line, so that ive got this circular 
sector this triangle 
whats area triangle 
piece 
well, height that triangle is 
square root minus tsquared, right 
base is length t, this hypotenuse 
is length 
so pythagorean theorem height 
that triangle is square root 
minus squared that means area 
this triangle is base times 
height square root minus 
squared divided 
so thats area this triangle, 
whats area circular sector 
well, ive got an angle here is 
theta a bit geometry that angle 
is that angle there 
this length here is t, right 
going to need that in a minute 
so if ive got a circular sector a 
radius a angle here, theta, that 
area is theta 
this length is 
so that means that i know a formula 
theta in terms 
theta is arcsine t, right, because, you 
know, really, sine theta is 
that means instead writing theta 
two that area, i could write 
area that circular sector to 
arcsine two 
so total area here is arc sin 
plus times square root minus 
squared 
alright 
thats exactly im claiming in 
accumulation function 
this term is calculating area that 
triangle 
this term is calculating area 
that circular sector 
happens if we evaluate 
accumilation function 
so i would calculating is 
interval to square root 
minus x squared dx 
thats i get i plug in 
equals here 
so times square root minus 
squared , 
plus arc sign well that term 
is arc sign is pie , so 
ive got pie that is 
pie is you know really 
area a quarter circle pieces 
coming together we compute 
accumulation function pure 
geometry trigonometry 
we verify that derivative really 
is square root minus x squared 
we recover area a 
semi circle this way well, right 
mathematical fact is an island
