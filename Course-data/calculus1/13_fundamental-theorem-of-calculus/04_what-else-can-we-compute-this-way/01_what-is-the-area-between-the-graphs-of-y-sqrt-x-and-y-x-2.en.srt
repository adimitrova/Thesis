[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:09,655
Let's use calculus not just to calculate 
the area under the graph of a function, 

3
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:14,670
let's use calculus to find the area 
between two curves. 

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,120
Specifically, what's the area between the 
graph of y equals the square root of x. 

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,699
And the graph of y equals x squared. 
As usual, let's start by drawing a graph 

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,922
of the situation. 
Here's my plane. 

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:36,880
the graph of y equals x squared maybe 
looks like that. 

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,768
And the graph of the square root of x, 
maybe looks like this in red. 

9
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:47,300
So what's this area between curves even 
mean? 

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,732
Well I really mean the area inside, this 
little wing shaped region here. 

11
00:00:53,732 --> 00:01:00,780
this point is worth thinking about, that 
point has coordinates 1,1. 

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,960
let's set it up as an integration 
problem. 

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,659
I can imagine carving this region up into 
lots of thin rectangles, right? 

14
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,084
Setting up a[UNKNOWN] sum. 
Let's draw some of those thin rectangles, 

15
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:18,271
in this region here. 
And, you have to worry a little bit about 

16
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,830
exactly how tall all these rectangles 
are. 

17
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,620
And how wide all these rectangles are. 
Well, how tall are these rectangles? 

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,470
Let's just pick one of the rectangles in 
particular to think about. 

19
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,770
Let's pick this rectangle, and think 
about it. 

20
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,650
How tall is it? 
Well, its top edge. 

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,470
Is on y equals the square root of x, and 
its bottom edge is on this orange curve. 

22
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,403
The y equals x squared term. 
So the height of that particular 

23
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:49,095
rectangle is its top coordinate minus its 
bottom coordinate, so it will be square 

24
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:53,972
root of x minus x squared tall And how 
wide is it? 

25
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:58,942
Well, the width of this little tiny tri-, 
rectangle, is, not supposed to very big, 

26
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:02,904
right? 
So let's call its width dx, right? 

27
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,831
I'm imagining that its, width is, very 
narrow. 

28
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,967
It's a very thin rectangle. 
So that amounts to evaluating a certain 

29
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,815
integral. 
Yeah, but which integral? 

30
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,790
Well, I want to add up the areas of all 
these little boxes. 

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,078
And these little boxes have heights given 
by this, and widths given by some small 

32
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:26,180
quantity, I'm[INAUDIBLE] dx. 
So the integral that I want to calculate 

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,218
will be the integral of the area. 
So it'll be the height. 

34
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:37,030
The square root of x minus x squared. 
Times the width which is DX. 

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,782
And then what does my X go between? 
Well the smallest value of X here is zero 

36
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:48,180
and the biggest value of X here is one so 
I'll have X going from zero to one. 

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,755
So that's the integral that I want to 
calculate which will find the area in 

38
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:58,643
between these two curves. 
I can evaluate that integral by using. 

39
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,220
The fundamental theorem of calculus. 
So, the fundamental theorem of calculus 

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,672
tells me to find an anti-derivative for 
this. 

41
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,636
So, let's first thing. 
What's an anti-derivative of the square 

42
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:11,690
root of x? 
Well that's an anti-derivative of x to 

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,696
the one half power. 
But remember my rule for 

44
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:19,115
anti-differentiaing x to a power. 
It's x to that power plus one, so 3 

45
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,455
halves is one more than a half, divided 
by that power plus 1, 3 halves so that 

46
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:28,075
when I differentiate this I get back x to 
the one half power and I'll just add some 

47
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:35,576
constant C on there to give myself the 
general anti-derivative. 

48
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:39,340
What if I want to anti-differentiate x 
squared? 

49
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,650
Well, that's maybe easier. 
And it's the same power rule. 

50
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,100
It's x to the third power, which is one 
more than two, divided by two plus one. 

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,516
So that when I differentiate this, I just 
get back x squared, and I'll add a 

52
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,330
constant. 
Now what's an antiderivative of the 

53
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,686
difference? 
Well, the difference of anti derivatives. 

54
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:04,783
So, the aniti derivative of the square of 
x minus x squared is the anti derivative 

55
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:10,243
for the squared of x which is x to the 3 
halves over 3 halves, minus the anti 

56
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:18,312
derivative for x squared. 
So, x to the 3rd over 3. 

57
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:22,590
So, there's the general anti-derivative 
for this. 

58
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,622
Armed with the anti-derivative, I can now 
evaluate the internal. 

59
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:32,190
So, one way to write that is as follows. 
If I went to integrate from 0 to 1, the 

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,760
squared of x, minus x squared dx. 
I'll just write down the anti-derivative 

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,735
for this, or an anti-derivative for this. 
Which is x to the 3 halves over 3 halves, 

62
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:49,540
minus x to the 3rd over 3. 
That's an anti-derivative for this, plus 

63
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,692
0, if you like. 
And then, I'll evaluate this quantity at 

64
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:58,444
0 and 1 and take the difference. 
So, this is a little bit of fancy 

65
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:01,924
notation. 
Just for plugging in x equals 1, plugging 

66
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:06,668
in x equals 0 and finding the difference. 
And if I want to emphasize what I'm 

67
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:10,264
plugging in I might write even x equals 0 
here just to emphasize that x is the 

68
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:14,624
variable that I'm working with. 
Alright well let's do that. 

69
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:20,740
let's plug in x equals 1 here. 
And when I do that I get 1 to the 3 

70
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,780
halves power over 3 halves minus 1 to the 
third over 3. 

71
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,540
And I'll subtract what I get when I plug 
in 0. 

72
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,138
SO I plug in 0, 0 to the 3 halves over 3 
halves minus 0 to the third. 

73
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,742
Over three. 
Well this is easy to calculate now. 

74
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:45,270
1 to the 3 halves is 1. 
So it's the reciprocal of three halves. 

75
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,100
Which is 2 3rds, minus 1 to the 3rd, 
which is 1 over 3. 

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,030
So that's just a third. 
And here I've got minus 0. 

77
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,289
So I've 2 3rds minus 1 3rd. 
This integral ends up being equal to 1 

78
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:09,940
3rd which is computing the area between 
the original curves. 

79
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,468
I hope this problem wets your appetite 
for harder problems along these same 

80
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:22,308
lines, right? 
You can imagine very complicated area 

81
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:26,684
calculations.
