lets use calculus to calculate 
area graph a function, 
lets use calculus to find area 
between two curves 
specifically, whats area between 
graph y equals square root x 
graph y equals x squared 
usual, lets start drawing a graph 
situation 
heres plane 
graph y equals x squared maybe 
looks like that 
graph square root x, 
maybe looks like this in red 
so whats this area between curves even 
mean 
well i really mean area inside, this 
little wing shaped region here 
this point is worth thinking about, that 
point coordinates , 
lets set an integration 
problem 
i imagine carving this region 
lots thin rectangles, right 
setting aunknown sum 
lets draw thin rectangles, 
in this region here 
and, you to worry a little bit 
exactly tall rectangles 

wide rectangles 
well, tall rectangles 
lets pick one rectangles in 
particular to think 
lets pick this rectangle, think 

tall is 
well, top edge 
is y equals square root x, 
bottom edge is this orange curve 
y equals x squared term 
so height that particular 
rectangle is top coordinate minus 
bottom coordinate, so will square 
root x minus x squared tall 
wide is 
well, width this little tiny tri, 
rectangle, is, supposed to big, 
right 
so lets call width dx, right 
im imagining that its, width is, 
narrow 
a thin rectangle 
so that amounts to evaluating a certain 
integral 
yeah, integral 
well, i want to add areas 
little boxes 
little boxes heights given 
this, widths given small 
quantity, iminaudible dx 
so integral that i want to calculate 
will integral area 
so itll height 
square root x minus x squared 
times width is dx 
x go between 
well smallest value x here is zero 
biggest value x here is one so 
ill x going zero to one 
so thats integral that i want to 
calculate will find area in 
between two curves 
i evaluate that integral using 
fundamental theorem calculus 
so, fundamental theorem calculus 
tells to find an antiderivative 
this 
so, lets first thing 
whats an antiderivative square 
root x 
well thats an antiderivative x to 
one half power 
remember rule 
antidifferentiaing x to a power 
x to that power plus one, so 
halves is one a half, divided 
that power plus , halves so that 
i differentiate this i get back x to 
one half power ill add 
constant c there to give 
general antiderivative 
if i want to antidifferentiate x 
squared 
well, thats maybe easier 
power rule 
x to third power, is one 
two, divided two plus one 
so that i differentiate this, i 
get back x squared, ill add a 
constant 
whats an antiderivative 
difference 
well, difference anti derivatives 
so, aniti derivative square 
x minus x squared is anti derivative 
squared x is x to 
halves halves, minus anti 
derivative x squared 
so, x to rd 
so, theres general antiderivative 
this 
armed antiderivative, i 
evaluate internal 
so, one way to write that is follows 
if i went to integrate to , 
squared x, minus x squared dx 
ill write antiderivative 
this, an antiderivative this 
is x to halves halves, 
minus x to rd 
thats an antiderivative this, plus 
, if you like 
then, ill evaluate this quantity 
take difference 
so, this is a little bit fancy 
notation 
plugging in x equals , plugging 
in x equals finding difference 
if i want to emphasize im 
plugging in i might write even x equals 
here to emphasize that x is 
variable that im working 
alright well lets that 
lets plug in x equals here 
i that i get to 
halves power halves minus to 
third 
ill subtract i get i plug 
in 
so i plug in , to halves 
halves minus to third 
three 
well this is easy to calculate 
to halves is 
so reciprocal three halves 
is rds, minus to rd, 
is 
so thats a third 
here ive got minus 
so ive rds minus rd 
this integral ends equal to 
rd is computing area between 
original curves 
i hope this problem wets appetite 
harder problems along 
lines, right 
you imagine complicated area 
calculations
