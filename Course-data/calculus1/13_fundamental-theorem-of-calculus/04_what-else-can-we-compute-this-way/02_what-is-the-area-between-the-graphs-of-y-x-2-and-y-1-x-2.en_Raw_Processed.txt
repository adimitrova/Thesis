lets find area between two 
parabolas 
i want to find area between graph 
y equals x squared graph y 
equals minus x squared 
usual lets start graphing 
well heres coordinate plane 
ill draw a graph y equals x squared 
curve is y equals minus x 
squared, so ill draw a downwardfacing 
parabola 
theres one side theres 
side 
ill draw rectangles to get an idea 
riemann sum i really want to 
take limit 
so really area inside here that 
i want to calculate 
draw rectangles 
riemann sum 
that would approximate that area 
right, so theres rectangles 
riemann sum that would approximate 
area in there 
i write heights 
widths one rectangles 
lets take a look say this rectangle 
here 
well, whats width that rectangle, 
will real thin, so ill call width 
dx 
whats height that rectangle 
well top that rectangle is 
curve minus x squared bottom 
that rectangle curve x 
squared 
so if we take top coordinate minus 
bottom coordinate, that will give 
height this rectangle 
top coordinate is minus x squared 
bottom y coordinate is x 
squared 
so this quantity is giving you height 
this rectangle 
oh, i write integral 
so i know height width 
rectangles so thing i want to 
add areas little 
rectangles 
so i want to integrate height 
minus, this is x squared, times 
width, dx 
im trying to integrate to 
where, right 
possible x values in this 
region 
well, if we think exactly 
two curves cross, right 
whats x coordinate 
curves cross 
this coordinate here is minus 
square root this coordinate 
is square root 
so im going to integrating to compute 
area x equals negative 
square root to 
square root 
this integral thatll calculate 
area in between two curves 
i use fundamental theorem 
calculus to evaluate this integral 
lets find an antiderivative 
so whats an antiderivative , well x 
is an antiderivative 
whats an antiderivative x squared, 
well x to rd differentiates 
to x squared 
im looking an antiderivative 
a difference, so itll difference 
antiderivatives 
ill evaluate antiderivative 
right left endpoints 
right, so i to evaluate 
antiderivative end points, 
square root minus 
square root take 
difference 
so i get i plug in 
square root 
i get square root minus 
times square root to 
third divided 
so this is i get i plug in x 
equals square root 
antiderivative 
i subtract i get i plug in 
negative that, is negative 
square root , minus times 
negative square root 
cubed, 
i simplify this a bit 
well, first off, ive got a quantity 
minus negative that quantity 
thats two copies this 
quantity 
i keep calculating this try 
to simplify this even a little bit 

lets keep going 
so i here 
well times square root 
, minus 
here ive got square root 
to rd power 
so i could write that a half 
times square root 
thats really copies square root 
divided 
okay 
but, times , alright, cancels 
ive got a common factor 
square root 
so i could, pull that common factor 
square root 
i pull that ive got a one 
there minus a third is left 
times square root , 
thats square root 
minus a third well thats really rds, 
so whats left here is 
square root 
times rds, this is value 
integral also then, area between 
two curves 
committing to this final 
answer, i check to see that 
answers somewhat reasonable 
well if we numerically approximate this, 
this is 
so is a bit less one square unit a 
reasonable answer 
well region that interested in 
fits inside a rectangle height , 
width square root units 
area this rectangle is 
square units 
area region we 
calculated to square units, 
right 
this region inside here 
pretty reasonable 
i mean, you know 
looks like 
if this thing is square units 
unreasonable to think that this 
is a little bit less square unit 
in this curved region, here 
yea, really finding answers that 
accord geometric intuition
