lets compute volume a bead 
first we to figure 
going to build bead a solid 
revolution 
so start x, y plane im 
going to draw a circle radius two in 
plane 
so, a circle radius if i take 
this rotate around y axis i 
got a sphere, i want to bead, so i 
going to imagine drilling a hole 
around y axis 
so to that we draw vertical 
lines here 
this is line x equals 
this is line, x equals minus 
noise okay, if i take 
region in here, rotate that region 
around y axis, that gives a bead 
thing giving a 
sphere 
a hole drilled around y 
axis 
weve got a choice 
we attack this problem shells 
washers 
if i want to washers, since 
im rotating around y axis, id 
cutting this horizontal strips 
if i take one horizontal 
strips rotate around y axis, 
that gives a washer, that looks 
like here is heres big washer 
thats, that works 
theres nothing wrong that, 
turns that if you way 
interval that you get is kind yucky 
lets try instead shells 
if i go shells, id cutting 
vertical strips 
parallel to axis rotation 
i take one little 
vertical strips rotate around 
well exactly ive got is, is 
one shell pieces 
we invoke formula volume a 
shell in terms dx 
so formula is pi, radius 
shell 
if i think one 
pieces say x, radius is x, since 
thats far is axis 
rotation 
height shell, i havent 
figured yet, times thickness 
shell, is dx 
i need to determine height 
shell 
so that big sphere radius 
this orange curve is that circle 
radius 
so i write that that orange 
curve is y equals square root 
squared minus x squared 
and, thats almost enough information to 
tell height shell 
let write height this 
shell is, then, height shell 
is well, tall is this thing 
well here, here to here, is 
square root squared minus x squared, 
distance, to 
side here 
so, height, is twice this quantity 
so, i write that pi x times 
height shell, is times 
square root squared, is 
minus x squared 
thats height shell, 
thickness shell dx 
lets think endpoints 
integration 
this purple line, right, line x 
equals 
orange circle, right, radius 
so, x take values between , 
that tells end points 
integration 
so, this is volume one 
shells, im going to integrate 
that x goes to , to get 
shells, add 
finally, we integrate pi times 
integral to , ill write x, 
square root minus x squared dx 
this is really shells shine, i 
set this now, you see i 
make a u substitution here 
so ill set u equal minus x squared, du 
in that case is minus x dx, put a minus 
sign there a minus sign there 
ive got du square root u, so this 
integral becomes minus pi 
square u d u i change 
endpoints, u goes x is , u is 
x is , u is , this is negative 
to , so i rewrite this 
pi integral to square 
root u du 
now, thats hard to 
i rewrite that integrand pi 
interval u to du to 
i easily anti differentiate that 
using power rule 
so this is pi, u to halves 
halves evaluated 
now, i plug in zero i get zero, 
so answer is whatever i get i 
plug in three 
so volume is pi times to 
halves power halves 
now, instead writing to halves 
power, i could write this pi 
halves times times square root 
right, thats to 
halves power 
look, this this cancel 
im dividing a half here, so this ends 
pi times square root 
this is volume bead 
we it, is answer reasonable 
well to think reasonable 
calculation volume bead 

we could think we build 
bead, alright we build this thing 
starting sphere radius two 
drilling a tube radius 
one 
so if i start sphere radius 
two i subtract even volume 
right, this cylinder height four 
extends top this sphere 
bottom sphere 
so this is even material i 
removed to get bead 
well that means that volume this 
sphere minus volume cylinders 
got to even a little bit less 
volume bead, right 
this is a little bit more, 
material material that we 
removed to get bead 
well big three things 
this thing here is a rds pie radius 
cubed thats volume a sphere minus 
this thing here is pie r squared times 
height is volume a cylinder 
i could simplify this a bit this is a 
times so thats rd pi minus pi, 
i simplify that a little bit 
even, thats rd pi 
we get to volume 
big bead we calculated that to pi 
square root 
yeah, this quanitiy here is a 
bit smaller this quantity here 
so, seems like answers 
reasonable
