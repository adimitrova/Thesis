00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:04,946
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:10,081
We can cut a three dimensional object up 
into shapes beyond just slabs, disks, 

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,643
washers. 
Specifically instead of building an 

4
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:18,625
object out of disks, instead of building 
it by stacking up disks of varying radii. 

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,260
We can build the object by wrapping it 
with these shells. 

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,970
This shell thing is supposed to be like a 
cardboard mailing tube. 

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,742
It's a cylinder sort of a thin wall. 
But how are shells different from 

8
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:33,800
washers? 
Well there are some similarities. 

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,686
Both shells and washers are things that 
you get by taking cylinders and drilling 

10
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:42,912
out other cylinders. 
But for washers, the thin dimension is 

11
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:46,422
its height. 
And for shells, the thin dimension is 

12
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,434
sort of the thickness of this wall. 
We need to write down a formula for the 

13
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:56,720
volume of a shell in terms of it's 
height, it's radius and that thin dr. 

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,660
Let me label those parts on the diagram 
here. 

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,460
So the height of the shell. 
I'll call h, the thickness of the shell. 

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,715
I'll call that dr, and the radius of the 
shell I'll just call r. 

17
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:14,732
Now, if I get out my scissors of 
mathematics here and cut the shell. 

18
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:19,282
You might imagine unrolling the shell, 
and then you just end up with a slab like 

19
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,590
this. 
How big is this slab? 

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,990
Well, the slab's height is still h. 
The thickness of this slab is dr. 

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,202
And how long is this slab? 
Well the slab's as long as the 

22
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:36,530
circumference of the circle , which is 2 
pi r. 

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,250
And multiplying these three dimensions 
will give me the volume of the slab. 

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:50,330
So you're guessing that the volume of the 
shell or the slab is 2 pi rh dr. 

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,040
We can say something a bit more precise. 
Well here's the shell again. 

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,011
But instead of calling this dr. 
Let's think of this as a big cylinder, 

27
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:02,627
with a little cylinder drilled out. 
So both the cylinders have the same 

28
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:06,559
heighth, h. 
But let's say the big cylinder has a 

29
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,960
radius, r. 
And the little cylinder has a radius 

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,670
little r. 
Let's write down the formula for the 

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,372
volume of the shell in between. 
So now the volume of the shell, right, is 

32
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:25,332
the volume of the big cylinder pi big R 
squared h. 

33
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:30,727
Minus the volume of the little cylinder 
that I drilled out, pi little r squared 

34
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:33,708
h. 
In effect you'll recognize that this, 

35
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:38,354
this makes it look a lot like a washer. 
But here's the difference, little r is 

36
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:42,128
really close to big R. 
Right, I'm thinking of their difference 

37
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,923
as dr. 
Right, very thin walled cylinder. 

38
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:50,340
Well lets rewrite this volume anyhow. 
I'm going to factor this out pi. 

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,594
Big R squared, minus little r squared, h. 
Now let's rewrite this. 

40
00:02:55,594 --> 00:03:01,930
This is a difference of squares, so I can 
write that as pie, big R plus little r. 

41
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,302
Big R minus little r, h. 
And thinking of the difference in these 

42
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:14,830
radii as being really small. 
So I'm going to rewrite this term as dr. 

43
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,642
So this is pi, big R plus little r, and 
I'll write h dr. 

44
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:25,800
Now what do I do with big R plus little 
r? 

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,886
Well this is the sum of these two radia. 
I mean, if you think about big R and 

46
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:35,520
little r as being really close together. 
I might as well just write this as 2 

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,630
little r. 
So I'll write this 2 pi little r. 

48
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,070
That's 2 little r's, if I'm imagining big 
R and little r to be close together, h 

49
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,470
dr. 
And you'll see this is the same as the 

50
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,810
formula that I got before for the volume 
of a shell. 

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,202
This formula, the formula for the volume 
of a shell, to write down an integral 

52
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:59,420
that calculates the volume of a solid of 
revolution. 

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,146
As an example, let's take this region. 
This is the graph y equals 1 minus x 

54
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:07,511
squared. 
And I just want to consider y greater and 

55
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:11,360
equal to 0, so consider this region 
inside here. 

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
So let me write y less than or equal to 1 
minus x. 

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,744
So just to emphasize this, it's this 
region inside here, and let's take that, 

58
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:21,520
and let's rotate that region around the y 
axis. 

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,414
To give myself this solid of revolution, 
I'm going to calculate the volume of that 

60
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:29,193
solid. 
Admittedly, we could do this problem 

61
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:34,787
without using shells, but using washers. 
In that case, I'd be chopping the region 

62
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:39,800
up into horizontal slices. 
And each of these horizontal slices, when 

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,690
I rotate it around the y axis would give 
me a disc. 

64
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,265
And then I just integrate the volumes of 
those discs to give me the volume of the 

65
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,810
solid of revolution. 
But let's try it with shells. 

66
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,334
In this case, I'll cut it up into 
vertical slices and I'll rotate these 

67
00:04:56,334 --> 00:05:01,540
vertical slices around the y axes to 
produce shells. 

68
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,170
And I'll integrate the volumes of those 
shells. 

69
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,580
To give me the volume of the whole solid 
of revolution. 

70
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,660
Now, we're going to use the formula, for 
the volume of a shell. 

71
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,686
Let's just look at one of those shells. 
So, here's one of these thin rectangles, 

72
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:24,527
I imagine, rotating this thin rectangle, 
around. 

73
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:33,770
The the y axis to produce this shell. 
Now, how how tall is this shell? 

74
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,400
Well, the height of that shell is given 
right here. 

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,646
It's 1 minus x squared. 
The radius of the shell is x and the 

76
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:51,480
thickness of that shell is dx. 
So, I put all those pieces together. 

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,295
I can write down the volume of just that 
one, one shell. 

78
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:03,310
And it'll be 2 pi, the radius of that 
shell. 

79
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,030
The height of that shell, the thickness 
of that shell. 

80
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,060
Now I have to worry about the end points 
of integration. 

81
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,745
You might think that I'd be integrating 
from x equals minus 1 to 1. 

82
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:21,590
But actually I only have to integrate 
from x equals 0 to 1. 

83
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,012
Because rotating a thin rectangle over 
here also accounts for stuff happening 

84
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:29,970
over here. 
So it's enough just to integrate from x 

85
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,712
goes from 0 to 1. 
So I'll write that here, x goes from 0 to 

86
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:37,316
1. 
This integral will calculate the volume 

87
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:41,240
of my solid of revolution. 
Finally, it's just a matter of evaluating 

88
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,350
the integral with the fundamental theorem 
of calculus. 

89
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,605
And to do this integral. 
Well I'll pull out these constants, 2 pi, 

90
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:54,848
the integral from 0 to 1 of x minus x 
cubed, when I combine these two terms. 

91
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,877
Now I just have to write down an 
antiderivative here. 

92
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:03,728
2 pi, antiderivative of x is x squared 
over 2, anti-derivative x cubed is x to 

93
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:09,280
the 4th over 4. 
And I'm evaluating this at x equals, 1, 

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,210
and x equals 0. 
And I'm subtracting, alright? 

95
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,410
That's the fundamental theorem of 
calculus. 

96
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,094
But when I plug in 0, I just get 0. 
So the answer is just whatever I get when 

97
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:24,650
I plug in 1. 
And, that's 2 pi, a half minus a 4th, and 

98
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:32,085
a half minus a 4th is a 4th. 
So, 2 pi times a 4th, and 2 times a 4th 

99
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:37,221
is a half. 
So, pi over 2, is the volume of my solid 

100
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:40,760
of revolution. 
We did it.
