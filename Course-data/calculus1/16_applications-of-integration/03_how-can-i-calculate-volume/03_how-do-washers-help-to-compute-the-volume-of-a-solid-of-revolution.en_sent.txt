let's figure out the volume of a certain  solid of revolution.
for example, let's think about this  region inside here, the region that's  below the graph of y equals the square  root of x.  and above the graph of y equals x  squared, just this little wing shaped  region inside here and let's take that  region and rotate it around the x axis.
when i take a region in the plane, and  rotate it around an axis, i get a solid  of revolution.
and the question is what's the volume of  that solid?
well let's cut this region up into little  tiny thin rectangles, and then, instead  of rotating the whole region, at once  around the x axis.
let's just imagine rotating each one of  these little rectangular pieces around  the x axis, and then adding up the  volumes of pieces.
what do those little rectangles become  when i rotate them around the x axis?
i'm going to take one of these little  thin rectangles, and rotate them around  the x axis.
well, to just get a picture here let me  just isolate a single rectangle, and  imagine just taking this.
thin rectangle, and rotating it around  the x axis.
well what would happen when i do that,  alright, is that i'll end up getting a  shape that looks a bit like that,  alright?
that shape we're going to call a washer.
what's the volume of a washer?
let me make this picture a little bit  bigger, alright?
here's a big picture of a washer.
and what are the parts of a washer?
well, the washer is got a thickness which  allows it to be thin.
so, i'm going to call it dx.
it's got a small radius which i'll call  little r and then it's got a big radius  which i'll call big r.  now, if i were jsut thinking about whole  scylinder of radius big r.  i know the volume of that.
the area of a circle of radius big r is  pi big r squared.
so if i thicken that up, the volume of a  cylinder of radius big r is pi, big r  squared and the thickness here is dx.
but then i'm drilling out this middle  part here to make the washer.
so i'm going to subtract from this the  volume of this inside cylinder which is  pi little r squared dx.
so this is the volume of just the washer  and the part that remains and i can write  this may be a little bit more reasonably  as pi.
times big r squared minus little r  squared times the thickness, dx.
now i'll use that formula, the volume  formula for washer to write down the  integral that calculates the volume of  solid of revolution.
i'm going back to this picture here.
i want to figure out the volume of say,  the washer at x.  so, first think about what's the big  radius.
well the big radius here is on the red  curve, right that's the outside of the  washer.
so big r is the square root of x.  and then the inside radius is on the  orange curve and that's given by x  squared.
so little r is x squared.
and that's the outside radius and the  inside radius in my in my washer picture  here.
okay, now i just gotta use the formula  for the volume of that washer, right.
and the formula for the volume of the  washer there is pi times big r squared  minus little r squared times the  thickness of the washer, which is dx.
what about the endpoints of integration?
well in my picture, x could be as small  as zero, or as big as one.
alright, i want to add up the volumes of  washers for x between 0 and 1.  so my integral is going to go from x  equals 0 to 1.  now all that remains is to evaluate that  integral.
so to begin, i'll simplify the integral a  bit, this is the integral from 0 to 1, äâ  times square root of x square, that's  just x, minus x squared squared, that's x  to the 4th.
i've got a constant pi.
i'll pull that constant out.
this is pi times the interval from zero  to one of x minus x to the fourth, and  i've just gotta write down an anti  derivative for that.
so that's pi times anti derivative of x  is x squared over 2.  minus anti-derivative x to the 4th, x to  the 5th over 5.  i'm evaluating this at 1, and at 0, and  taking the difference.
when i plug in 0 i don't get anything, so  the answer is just whatever happens when  i plug in 1, which is pi times one half,  minus one 5th.
and, if i like, i could write this as a  single fraction, this is pi times 5  10ths, minus 2 10ths.
or, all together, pi times 3 10ths, so  that's the volume of the solid of  revolution.
and we did it.
