lets figure volume a certain 
solid revolution 
example, lets think this 
region inside here, region thats 
graph y equals square 
root x 
graph y equals x 
squared, this little wing shaped 
region inside here lets take that 
region rotate around x axis 
i take a region in plane, 
rotate around an axis, i get a solid 
revolution 
question is whats volume 
that solid 
well lets cut this region little 
tiny thin rectangles, then, instead 
rotating whole region, 
around x axis 
lets imagine rotating one 
little rectangular pieces around 
x axis, adding 
volumes pieces 
little rectangles become 
i rotate around x axis 
im going to take one little 
thin rectangles, rotate around 
x axis 
well, to get a picture here let 
isolate a single rectangle, 
imagine taking this 
thin rectangle, rotating around 
x axis 
well would happen i that, 
alright, is that ill end getting a 
shape that looks a bit like that, 
alright 
that shape going to call a washer 
whats volume a washer 
let make this picture a little bit 
bigger, alright 
heres a big picture a washer 
parts a washer 
well, washer is got a thickness 
allows to thin 
so, im going to call dx 
got a small radius ill call 
little r got a big radius 
ill call big r 
now, if i jsut thinking whole 
scylinder radius big r 
i know volume that 
area a circle radius big r is 
pi big r squared 
so if i thicken that up, volume a 
cylinder radius big r is pi, big r 
squared thickness here is dx 
im drilling this middle 
part here to make washer 
so im going to subtract this 
volume this inside cylinder is 
pi little r squared dx 
so this is volume washer 
part that remains i write 
this may a little bit reasonably 
pi 
times big r squared minus little r 
squared times thickness, dx 
ill use that formula, volume 
formula washer to write 
integral that calculates volume 
solid revolution 
im going back to this picture here 
i want to figure volume say, 
washer x 
so, first think whats big 
radius 
well big radius here is red 
curve, right thats outside 
washer 
so big r is square root x 
inside radius is 
orange curve thats given x 
squared 
so little r is x squared 
thats outside radius 
inside radius in in washer picture 
here 
okay, i gotta use formula 
volume that washer, right 
formula volume 
washer there is pi times big r squared 
minus little r squared times 
thickness washer, is dx 
endpoints integration 
well in picture, x could small 
zero, big one 
alright, i want to add volumes 
washers x between 
so integral is going to go x 
equals to 
that remains is to evaluate that 
integral 
so to begin, ill simplify integral a 
bit, this is integral to , 
times square root x square, thats 
x, minus x squared squared, thats x 
to th 
ive got a constant pi 
ill pull that constant 
this is pi times interval zero 
to one x minus x to fourth, 
ive gotta write an anti 
derivative that 
so thats pi times anti derivative x 
is x squared 
minus antiderivative x to th, x to 
th 
im evaluating this , , 
taking difference 
i plug in i dont get anything, so 
answer is whatever happens 
i plug in , is pi times one half, 
minus one th 
and, if i like, i could write this a 
single fraction, this is pi times 
ths, minus ths 
or, together, pi times ths, so 
thats volume solid 
revolution 
we
