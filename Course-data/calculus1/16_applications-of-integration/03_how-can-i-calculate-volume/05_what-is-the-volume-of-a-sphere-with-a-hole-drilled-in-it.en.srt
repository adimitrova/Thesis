1
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:04,926
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:08,769
Let's compute the volume of a bead but 
first we have to figure out how we're 

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,693
going to build the bead as a solid of 
revolution. 

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:18,450
So start with the X, Y plane and I'm 
going to draw a circle of radius two in 

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,878
the plane. 
So, its a circle of radius 2 if I take 

6
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:28,880
this and rotate around the Y axis and I 
got a sphere, but I want to bead, so I am 

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,687
going to imagine drilling out a hole 
around the Y axis. 

8
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:40,391
So to do that we can draw these vertical 
lines here. 

9
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:46,481
This is the line x equals 1. 
This is the line, x equals minus 1. 

10
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:53,449
[NOISE] Okay, now if I just take the the 
region in here, and rotate that region 

11
00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:00,999
around the y axis, that gives me a bead. 
It's the same thing as giving me a 

12
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:05,023
sphere. 
With a hole drilled out around the y 

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,320
axis. 
We've got a choice. 

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,435
We can attack this problem with shells or 
with washers. 

15
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:14,827
If I want to do it with washers, since 
I'm rotating around the y axis, I'd be 

16
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:21,411
cutting this into horizontal strips. 
Because if I take one of these horizontal 

17
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:25,947
strips and rotate it around the y axis, 
that gives me a washer, and that looks 

18
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:32,810
like here is my here's my big washer. 
And that's, that works. 

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,834
There's nothing wrong with that, but it 
turns out that if you do it the way the 

20
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:41,250
interval that you get is kind of yucky. 
But let's try it instead with shells. 

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,940
If I go with shells, then I'd be cutting 
into vertical strips. 

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,924
Parallel to the axis of rotation. 
And when I take one of those little 

23
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:57,969
vertical strips and rotate it around. 
Well then exactly what I've got is, is 

24
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:03,515
one of these shell pieces. 
Now we invoke the formula for volume of a 

25
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:09,313
shell in terms of dx. 
So the formula is 2 pi, the radius of the 

26
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:13,061
shell. 
Which if I think of just one of these 

27
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:17,201
pieces say at x, the radius is x, since 
that's how far it is from the axis of 

28
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:22,715
rotation. 
The height of the shell, which I haven't 

29
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:27,760
figured out yet, times the thickness of 
the shell, which is then dx. 

30
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,355
Now I need to determine the height of the 
shell. 

31
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:37,006
So that big sphere has radius 2. 
And this orange curve is that circle with 

32
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:41,708
radius 2. 
So I can write down that that orange 

33
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:49,590
curve is y equals the square root of 2 
squared minus x squared. 

34
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,278
And, that's almost enough information to 
tell me the height of the shell. 

35
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:56,983
Let me write down what the height of this 
shell is, then, the height of the shell 

36
00:02:56,983 --> 00:03:01,724
is well, how tall is this thing. 
Well here, from here to here, is the 

37
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:06,146
square root of 2 squared minus x squared, 
and then it's the same distance, down to 

38
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:12,520
the other side here. 
So, the height, is twice this quantity. 

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,812
So, I can write that down; 2 Pi X times 
the height of the shell, which is 2 times 

40
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:24,590
the square root of 2 squared, which is 4 
minus X squared. 

41
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,920
That's the height of the shell, and then 
the thickness of the shell dx. 

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,690
Let's think about the endpoints of 
integration. 

43
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,840
This purple line, right, was the line x 
equals 1. 

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,230
And the orange circle, right, has radius 
2. 

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,646
So, x can take values between 1 and 2, 
and that tells me what my end points of 

46
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:47,739
integration should be. 
So, this is the volume of just one of 

47
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,399
those shells, and I'm going to integrate 
that x goes from 1 to 2, to get all of 

48
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:58,169
the shells, and add them all up. 
Finally, we integrate it's 2 pi times the 

49
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:06,050
integral from 1 to 2, and I'll write 2x, 
the square root of 4 minus x squared dx. 

50
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,886
And this is really where shells shine, I 
set this up now, and you can see I can 

51
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:17,606
make a u substitution here. 
So I'll set u equal 4 minus x squared, du 

52
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:24,730
in that case is minus 2x dx, put a minus 
sign there and a minus sign there. 

53
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:32,220
Now I've got du square root of u, so this 
integral becomes minus 2 pi. 

54
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,852
Square of u d u and I can change the 
endpoints, u goes from when x is 1, u is 

55
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:42,836
3. 
When x is 2, u is 0, and this is negative 

56
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:49,058
from 3 to 0, so I can rewrite this as 2 
pi the integral from 0 to 3 of the square 

57
00:04:49,058 --> 00:05:02,780
root of u du. 
Now, that's not hard to do. 

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,430
I can rewrite that integrand as 2 pi the 
interval of u to the 1/2 du from 0 to 3. 

59
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,480
And I can easily anti differentiate that 
using the power rule. 

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,550
So this is 2 pi, u to the 3 halves over 3 
halves evaluated at 0 and 3. 

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,942
Now, when I plug in zero I just get zero, 
so my answer is whatever I get when I 

62
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:28,736
plug in three. 
So the volume is 2 pi times 3 to the 3 

63
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:36,386
halves power over 3 halves. 
Now, instead of writing 3 to the 3 halves 

64
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:40,922
power, I could write this as 2 pi over 3 
halves times 3 times the square root of 

65
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,472
3. 
Right, that's the same as 3 to the 3 

66
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:48,870
halves power. 
But look, this 3 and this 3 cancel and 

67
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:58,130
I'm dividing by a half here, so this ends 
up being 4 pi times the square root of 3. 

68
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,800
This is the volume of our bead. 
We did it, but is the answer reasonable? 

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Well to think about how reasonable our 
calculation for the volume of the bead 

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,890
was. 
We could think about how we build the 

71
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,742
bead, alright we build this thing by 
starting with the sphere of radius two 

72
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:15,680
and then drilling out a tube of radius 
one. 

73
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,100
So if I start with the sphere of radius 
two and I subtract even more volume 

74
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,691
right, this cylinder of height four 
extends above the top of this sphere and 

75
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:28,680
below the bottom of the sphere. 
So this is even more material than I 

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,544
removed to get the bead. 
Well that means that the volume of this 

77
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,693
sphere minus the volume of the cylinder's 
got to be even a little bit less than the 

78
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:39,843
volume of the bead, right? 
Because this is a little bit more, 

79
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:44,430
material than the material that we 
removed to get the bead. 

80
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,490
Well how big are these three things? 
This thing here is a 4 3rds pie radius 

81
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,186
cubed thats the volume of a sphere minus 
this thing here is pie r squared times 

82
00:06:54,186 --> 00:07:02,175
height is the volume of a cylinder. 
I could simplify this a bit this is a 4 

83
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:07,131
times 8 so that's 32 3rd pi minus 4 pi, 
and I can simplify that a little bit 

84
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:15,450
further even, that's 20 3rd pi. 
And what do we get to the volume of the 

85
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:22,630
big bead we calculated that to be 4 pi 
square root of 3. 

86
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,950
And yeah, this quanitiy here is just a 
bit smaller than this quantity here. 

87
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,920
So, it seems like our answer's 
reasonable.
