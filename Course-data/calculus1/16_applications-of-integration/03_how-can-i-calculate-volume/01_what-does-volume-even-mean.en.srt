2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:08,288
We've done a bunch of area
calculations at this point, so

3
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:11,680
let's move up a dimension and
think about volume.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,520
Let me ask, really loudly, what is Volume?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,640
Of course, what is area, right?

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
Area is the thing that
integrals calculate.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,940
So instead of trying to give
a definition of volume,

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,750
let's just focus on how we're gonna
compute volume, whatever it is.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,140
And we're gonna compute volume by
integrating the volume of little,

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,070
tiny pieces that we cut
up our objects into.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,770
Let's work through an example.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,320
Here's a cone.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,680
I want to compute the volume of this cone.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,650
Just for concreteness, let's suppose that
the cone has a height of two units and

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,640
a radius of one unit, and
I want to compute its volume.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,070
I want to set this thing up
as an integration problem.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,500
I want to cut this thing
up into slices and

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,068
add up the volumes of the little slices.

19
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,800
So imagine that I take this and

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,940
I just slice it up into
a bunch of really thin pieces.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,710
Now what's the volume of a slice?

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,580
Well that slice is practically
a little tiny cylinder.

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,910
So what's the volume of one
of these very thin cylinders.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,450
Well let's suppose the cylinder
has some radius r.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,850
And I'm going to call its height,
its height should be really thin, so

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,130
I'll call its height dx.

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,260
And in that case the volume of this
cylinder is, what's the area of the top?

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,880
It's pi r squared times its height,
which is dx.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,520
So, this here will be our formula for
the volume of one of these thin cylinders.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,390
And, once again, we're seeing the
importance of the differentials, right?

31
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,660
We're using the differentials
to write down an equation for

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,390
the volume of the thin cylinder.

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,300
Anyhow, let's put this
together in integral.

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,310
But to set up the integral to
calculate the volume of this cone,

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,500
I first have to figure out the volume of
one of the slices that make up this cone.

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,960
To do that,
let's turn this cone on its side, and

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,740
let's imagine that this is the point 0, 0.

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,310
So let's make this the y axis, so
the x axis will head in that direction.

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,590
Then what do I have here?

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,830
Well, this line is the line
y equals x over 2.

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,430
Now I'll use that to figure out
the radius of one of those slices.

42
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,540
Pick some value of x, and
let's think about one of the slices.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,450
One of these thin cylinders that
I'm using to build up the big cone.

44
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,490
I don't know the radius of
that particular cylinder.

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,800
Well, it's this distance here, and
I know the Y coordinate up there.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,790
The Y coordinate is X over 2, so the
radius is of this cylinder is X over 2.

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,930
I can write down the volume of that disk.

48
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,740
The volume is pie times the radius,

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:08,080
which is x over 2 squared times
the thickness of that disk which is dx.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,380
And now I'm integrating
this from where to where?

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,640
Well x goes from 0 all the way down to 2,
so this will be the integral

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,310
from x equals 0 to 2 and this integral
will calculate the volumn of my cone.

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,190
And now we use the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

54
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,520
I can simplify this a bit, I have some
constants here I can pull out, right.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,800
I can pull out the pie and
I can pull out 1/2 squared.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,720
This is pi over 4 times
the integral from 0 to 2.

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,200
Just x squared dx.

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Now, what's an anti-derivative for
x squared?

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,020
Well, x to the 3rd over 3.

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,110
And then, I'm integrating that.

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,610
I'm evaluating that at 0 and
at 2 and taking the difference.

62
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,550
So when I plug in 0, I don't get anything,
but when I plug in 2, I get 8.

63
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,580
That's 2 cubed over 3, and then minus 0.

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,910
So this is the volume of the cone,
which I could simplify somewhat.

65
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,580
I could write this as 2 times pi over 3.

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,840
We did it.

67
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,830
Well, you could have just looked up this
formula in the back of some calculus text

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,690
book, but
that's beside the point here, right.

69
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,100
The point here is that we're
teaching you the secrets of volume.

70
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,770
You can now verify that the formulas in
the back of the textbook are correct.

71
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,490
And that's part of the fun of mathematics,
we're not just giving you information.

72
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,539
We're giving you the information and

73
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,066
the tools with which to verify
that that information is correct.
