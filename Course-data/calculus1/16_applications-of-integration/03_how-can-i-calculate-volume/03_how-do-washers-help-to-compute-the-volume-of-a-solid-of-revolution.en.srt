00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:05,175
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:09,079
Let's figure out the volume of a certain 
solid of revolution. 

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,179
For example, let's think about this 
region inside here, the region that's 

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,288
below the graph of y equals the square 
root of x. 

5
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:19,174
And above the graph of y equals x 
squared, just this little wing shaped 

6
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:25,392
region inside here and let's take that 
region and rotate it around the x axis. 

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,174
When I take a region in the plane, and 
rotate it around an axis, I get a solid 

8
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:33,125
of revolution. 
And the question is what's the volume of 

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,719
that solid? 
Well let's cut this region up into little 

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
tiny thin rectangles, and then, instead 
of rotating the whole region, at once 

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,102
around the x axis. 
Let's just imagine rotating each one of 

12
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:51,433
these little rectangular pieces around 
the x axis, and then adding up the 

13
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:56,124
volumes of pieces. 
What do those little rectangles become 

14
00:00:56,124 --> 00:01:00,116
when I rotate them around the x axis? 
I'm going to take one of these little 

15
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:03,180
thin rectangles, and rotate them around 
the x axis. 

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,280
Well, to just get a picture here let me 
just isolate a single rectangle, and 

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,499
imagine just taking this. 
Thin rectangle, and rotating it around 

18
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:13,541
the x axis. 
Well what would happen when I do that, 

19
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,079
alright, is that I'll end up getting a 
shape that looks a bit like that, 

20
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:22,498
alright? 
That shape we're going to call a washer. 

21
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:27,290
What's the volume of a washer? 
Let me make this picture a little bit 

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,760
bigger, alright? 
Here's a big picture of a washer. 

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,188
And what are the parts of a washer? 
Well, the washer is got a thickness which 

24
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,530
allows it to be thin. 
So, I'm going to call it dx. 

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,696
It's got a small radius which I'll call 
little r and then it's got a big radius 

26
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:51,378
which I'll call big R. 
Now, If I were jsut thinking about whole 

27
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:56,890
scylinder of radius big r. 
I know the volume of that. 

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,250
The area of a circle of radius big r is 
pi big r squared. 

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,570
So if I thicken that up, the volume of a 
cylinder of radius big r is pi, big r 

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,701
squared and the thickness here is dx. 
But then I'm drilling out this middle 

31
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:17,517
part here to make the washer. 
So I'm going to subtract from this the 

32
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:23,400
volume of this inside cylinder which is 
pi little r squared dx. 

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,690
So this is the volume of just the washer 
and the part that remains and I can write 

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,760
this may be a little bit more reasonably 
as pi. 

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,300
Times big r squared minus little r 
squared times the thickness, dx. 

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,021
Now I'll use that formula, the volume 
formula for washer to write down the 

37
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:46,920
integral that calculates the volume of 
solid of revolution. 

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,270
I'm going back to this picture here. 
I want to figure out the volume of say, 

39
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,020
the washer at x. 
So, first think about what's the big 

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,120
radius. 
Well the big radius here is on the red 

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,720
curve, right that's the outside of the 
washer. 

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,760
So big R is the square root of x. 
And then the inside radius is on the 

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,880
orange curve and that's given by x 
squared. 

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,494
so little r is x squared. 
And that's the outside radius and the 

45
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:21,815
inside radius in my in my washer picture 
here. 

46
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:28,535
Okay, now I just gotta use the formula 
for the volume of that washer, right. 

47
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:33,842
And the formula for the volume of the 
washer there is pi times big R squared 

48
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:41,470
minus little r squared times the 
thickness of the washer, which is dx. 

49
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,961
What about the endpoints of integration? 
Well in my picture, x could be as small 

50
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:52,659
as zero, or as big as one. 
Alright, I want to add up the volumes of 

51
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:58,496
washers for x between 0 and 1. 
So my integral is going to go from x 

52
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:02,606
equals 0 to 1. 
Now all that remains is to evaluate that 

53
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:06,272
integral. 
So to begin, I'll simplify the integral a 

54
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,488
bit, this is the integral from 0 to 1, Ď 
times square root of x square, that's 

55
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:15,843
just x, minus x squared squared, that's x 
to the 4th. 

56
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,970
I've got a constant pi. 
I'll pull that constant out. 

57
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,935
This is pi times the interval from zero 
to one of x minus x to the fourth, and 

58
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,200
I've just gotta write down an anti 
derivative for that. 

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,945
So that's pi times anti derivative of x 
is x squared over 2. 

60
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:38,390
Minus anti-derivative x to the 4th, x to 
the 5th over 5. 

61
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm evaluating this at 1, and at 0, and 
taking the difference. 

62
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,958
when I plug in 0 I don't get anything, so 
the answer is just whatever happens when 

63
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:52,910
I plug in 1, which is pi times one half, 
minus one 5th. 

64
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,447
And, if I like, I could write this as a 
single fraction, this is pi times 5 

65
00:04:55,447 --> 00:05:01,466
10ths, minus 2 10ths. 
Or, all together, pi times 3 10ths, so 

66
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:09,780
that's the volume of the solid of 
revolution. 

67
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,170
And we did it.
