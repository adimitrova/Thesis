we cut a three dimensional object 
shapes beyond slabs, disks, 
washers 
specifically instead building an 
object disks, instead building 
stacking disks varying radii 
we build object wrapping 
shells 
this shell thing is supposed to like a 
cardboard mailing tube 
a cylinder sort a thin wall 
shells different 
washers 
well there similarities 
shells washers things that 
you get taking cylinders drilling 
cylinders 
washers, thin dimension is 
height 
shells, thin dimension is 
sort thickness this wall 
we need to write a formula 
volume a shell in terms 
height, radius that thin dr 
let label parts diagram 
here 
so height shell 
ill call h, thickness shell 
ill call that dr, radius 
shell ill call r 
now, if i get scissors 
mathematics here cut shell 
you might imagine unrolling shell, 
you end a slab like 
this 
big is this slab 
well, slabs height is still h 
thickness this slab is dr 
long is this slab 
well slabs long 
circumference circle , is 
pi r 
multiplying three dimensions 
will give volume slab 
so youre guessing that volume 
shell slab is pi rh dr 
we say something a bit precise 
well heres shell 
instead calling this dr 
lets think this a big cylinder, 
a little cylinder drilled 
so cylinders 
heighth, h 
lets say big cylinder a 
radius, r 
little cylinder a radius 
little r 
lets write formula 
volume shell in between 
so volume shell, right, is 
volume big cylinder pi big r 
squared h 
minus volume little cylinder 
that i drilled out, pi little r squared 
h 
in effect youll recognize that this, 
this makes look a lot like a washer 
heres difference, little r is 
really close to big r 
right, im thinking difference 
dr 
right, thin walled cylinder 
well lets rewrite this volume anyhow 
im going to factor this pi 
big r squared, minus little r squared, h 
lets rewrite this 
this is a difference squares, so i 
write that pie, big r plus little r 
big r minus little r, h 
thinking difference in 
radii really small 
so im going to rewrite this term dr 
so this is pi, big r plus little r, 
ill write h dr 
i big r plus little 
r 
well this is sum two radia 
i mean, if you think big r 
little r really close together 
i might well write this 
little r 
so ill write this pi little r 
thats little rs, if im imagining big 
r little r to close together, h 
dr 
youll see this is 
formula that i got volume 
a shell 
this formula, formula volume 
a shell, to write an integral 
that calculates volume a solid 
revolution 
an example, lets take this region 
this is graph y equals minus x 
squared 
i want to consider y greater 
equal to , so consider this region 
inside here 
so let write y less equal to 
minus x 
so to emphasize this, this 
region inside here, lets take that, 
lets rotate that region around y 
axis 
to give this solid revolution, 
im going to calculate volume that 
solid 
admittedly, we could this problem 
without using shells, using washers 
in that case, id chopping region 
horizontal slices 
horizontal slices, 
i rotate around y axis would give 
a disc 
i integrate volumes 
discs to give volume 
solid revolution 
lets try shells 
in this case, ill cut 
vertical slices ill rotate 
vertical slices around y axes to 
produce shells 
ill integrate volumes 
shells 
to give volume whole solid 
revolution 
now, going to use formula, 
volume a shell 
lets look one shells 
so, heres one thin rectangles, 
i imagine, rotating this thin rectangle, 
around 
y axis to produce this shell 
now, tall is this shell 
well, height that shell is given 
right here 
minus x squared 
radius shell is x 
thickness that shell is dx 
so, i put pieces together 
i write volume that 
one, one shell 
itll pi, radius that 
shell 
height that shell, thickness 
that shell 
i to worry end points 
integration 
you might think that id integrating 
x equals minus to 
actually i to integrate 
x equals to 
rotating a thin rectangle 
here also accounts stuff happening 
here 
so enough to integrate x 
goes to 
so ill write that here, x goes to 
this integral will calculate volume 
solid revolution 
finally, a matter evaluating 
integral fundamental theorem 
calculus 
to this integral 
well ill pull constants, pi, 
integral to x minus x 
cubed, i combine two terms 
i to write an 
antiderivative here 
pi, antiderivative x is x squared 
, antiderivative x cubed is x to 
th 
im evaluating this x equals, , 
x equals 
im subtracting, alright 
thats fundamental theorem 
calculus 
i plug in , i get 
so answer is whatever i get 
i plug in 
and, thats pi, a half minus a th, 
a half minus a th is a th 
so, pi times a th, times a th 
is a half 
so, pi , is volume solid 
revolution 
we
