00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,039
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,321
We're going to compute the volume of a 
sphere. 

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:15,229
Well here I got a clay sphere. 
And if I measure if I find that it's 

4
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:24,270
diameter its about 4.2. 
The diameter is about 4.2 centimeters. 

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,074
So its radius, say 2.1 centimeters. 
Now, we're going to take this sphere and 

6
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:35,255
crush it flat. 
And I want to make it so that it's about 

7
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:41,000
1 centimeter thick. 
Now I'll estimate the volume of that 

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,049
blob. 
So we measure this thing's maybe a bit 

9
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:51,150
under 7 centimeters by a bit over 5 
centimeters, and it's a centimeter thick. 

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,875
So I'd guess that the volume is about 35 
cubic centimeters. 

11
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,934
But that wasn't all that precise. 
But we can do the calculation precisely 

12
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:05,820
by taking the sphere, slicing it into 
discs thin cylinders. 

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,988
Integrating those thin cylinders right 
and that'll give us the exact volume of 

14
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:13,240
the sphere. 
So, we're going to take the sphere and 

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,670
I'm going to slice this thing up into 
lots and lots of little tiny cylinders. 

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,550
We have to figure out the radius of each 
of those thin cylinders. 

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,380
Well let me draw the picture again, 
alright? 

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,716
Here's the plane, this is the y axis and 
the x axis, and I've got my circle in the 

19
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:39,240
xy plane. 
And here is the sphere sitting in space. 

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,701
And in some height call that height y. 
I got a thin cylinder, what I want to do 

21
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:52,480
is to figure the radius of that thin 
cylinder. 

22
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,642
Really what that amounts is figuring out 
the coordinates of this point here. 

23
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,290
Right. 
I want to figure out what that x 

24
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,880
coordinate is, so that x, y lands on that 
circle. 

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,534
Well I know the equation for the circle 
in the xy plane. 

26
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:10,694
That's x squared plus y squared equals r 
squared, r is the radius of the sphere 

27
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:15,880
that I'm thinking about. 
And I can solve this for x. 

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,740
X equals the square root of r squared 
minus y squared. 

29
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,310
This is the radius of this little tiny 
thin blue cylinder here. 

30
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,942
And I'm going to cut up my sphere into a 
whole bunch of these little tiny 

31
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,743
cylinders. 
And add up the volume of those cylinders 

32
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:36,225
to give me the volume of the whole 
sphere. 

33
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:40,480
Now I want to figure out the volume of 
that thin cylinder. 

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,780
Now, what's the volume of this slice? 
What's the volume of that thin cylinder. 

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,310
Well, it's pi times the radius of that 
cylinider, which is given by this. 

36
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,820
So the radius is the square root of r 
squared minus y squared and it's that 

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,955
radius squared. 
Right, this is pi radius of cylinder 

38
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:04,707
squared, times the height of that 
cylinder, well the height of that 

39
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:09,913
cylinder is dy. 
So this is giving me the volume of this 

40
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:13,994
thin cylinder. 
We have to think about the end points of 

41
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:18,720
integration. 
Well how big and how small can y be? 

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,676
Well y goes all the way down here to 
minus r and y goes all the way up here to 

43
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:28,870
r. 
So when I set up my integral and I want 

44
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,400
to integrate this, y goes from minus r to 
r. 

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,780
Now we can integrate. 
So first I'll simplify the integrand. 

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,720
This is the integral y goes from minus r 
to r of pi times the square root squared, 

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,458
just r squared minus y squared dy. 
Now I can simplify this a bit more. 

48
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:54,420
I've got a constant, always pull that 
constant out. 

49
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,660
This is pi times the integral from minus 
r to r of r squared minus y squared dy. 

50
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,625
Now I've gotta cook up an anti-derivative 
of this. 

51
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,570
Alright, to use a fundamental term of 
calculus. 

52
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,104
So this'll be pi times, so what's an 
anti-derivative of just r squared, r is 

53
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:13,933
just a constant here. 
So an anti-derivative of that will just 

54
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:18,581
be r squared times y minus an 
anti-derivative of y squared is y cubed 

55
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:25,544
over three. 
I'll be ecaluating that from r and minus 

56
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,596
r. 
But if you think about it a bit I can get 

57
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:32,151
away with using from 0 to r if I multiply 
this by 2. 

58
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,740
And that'll simplify the calculation 
somewhat. 

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Alright, now I was going to plug in r and 
plug in 0. 

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,960
So, when I plug in r, I get r squared 
times r minus r cubed over 3. 

61
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
And when I plug in 0 I just get 0. 
So I don't have to subtract that. 

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,850
And I can keep working on this. 
What do I do? 

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:07,653
I got 2 pi r cubed minus 1 3rd r cubed. 
Let's call this 3 3rd's cubed. 

64
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:14,013
Alright, so this is now 2 3rd r cubed 
times 2 pi or this ends up being 4 3rd's 

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:20,640
pi r cubed. 
We did it, yeah the volume of a sphere 

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,233
here of a radius r. 
We just calculated it, its 4 3rds pi r 

67
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:34,390
cubed and we could reach into even higher 
dimensions. 

68
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,062
For example, you could try to write down 
an integral that calculates the volume of 

69
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:41,100
a hyper sphere. 
What's a hyper sphere? 

70
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,700
Well, that's the higher dimensional 
analog of the regular old sphere, a 

71
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:53,890
sphere is sort of a stack of circles. 
So a hypersphere will be a stack of 

72
00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:03,631
spheres but in the fourth dimension.
