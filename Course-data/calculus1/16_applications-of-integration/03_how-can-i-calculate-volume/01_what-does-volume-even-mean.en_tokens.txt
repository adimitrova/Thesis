we
've
done
a
bunch
of
area
calculations
at
this
point
,
so
let
's
move
up
a
dimension
and
think
about
volume
.
let
me
ask
,
really
loudly
,
what
is
volume
?
of
course
,
what
is
area
,
right
?
area
is
the
thing
that
integrals
calculate
.
so
instead
of
trying
to
give
a
definition
of
volume
,
let
's
just
focus
on
how
we
're
gon
na
compute
volume
,
whatever
it
is
.
and
we
're
gon
na
compute
volume
by
integrating
the
volume
of
little
,
tiny
pieces
that
we
cut
up
our
objects
into
.
let
's
work
through
an
example
.
here
's
a
cone
.
i
want
to
compute
the
volume
of
this
cone
.
just
for
concreteness
,
let
's
suppose
that
the
cone
has
a
height
of
two
units
and
a
radius
of
one
unit
,
and
i
want
to
compute
its
volume
.
i
want
to
set
this
thing
up
as
an
integration
problem
.
i
want
to
cut
this
thing
up
into
slices
and
add
up
the
volumes
of
the
little
slices
.
so
imagine
that
i
take
this
and
i
just
slice
it
up
into
a
bunch
of
really
thin
pieces
.
now
what
's
the
volume
of
a
slice
?
well
that
slice
is
practically
a
little
tiny
cylinder
.
so
what
's
the
volume
of
one
of
these
very
thin
cylinders
.
well
let
's
suppose
the
cylinder
has
some
radius
r.
and
i
'm
going
to
call
its
height
,
its
height
should
be
really
thin
,
so
i
'll
call
its
height
dx
.
and
in
that
case
the
volume
of
this
cylinder
is
,
what
's
the
area
of
the
top
?
it
's
pi
r
squared
times
its
height
,
which
is
dx
.
so
,
this
here
will
be
our
formula
for
the
volume
of
one
of
these
thin
cylinders
.
and
,
once
again
,
we
're
seeing
the
importance
of
the
differentials
,
right
?
we
're
using
the
differentials
to
write
down
an
equation
for
the
volume
of
the
thin
cylinder
.
anyhow
,
let
's
put
this
together
in
integral
.
but
to
set
up
the
integral
to
calculate
the
volume
of
this
cone
,
i
first
have
to
figure
out
the
volume
of
one
of
the
slices
that
make
up
this
cone
.
to
do
that
,
let
's
turn
this
cone
on
its
side
,
and
let
's
imagine
that
this
is
the
point
0
,
0.
so
let
's
make
this
the
y
axis
,
so
the
x
axis
will
head
in
that
direction
.
then
what
do
i
have
here
?
well
,
this
line
is
the
line
y
equals
x
over
2.
now
i
'll
use
that
to
figure
out
the
radius
of
one
of
those
slices
.
pick
some
value
of
x
,
and
let
's
think
about
one
of
the
slices
.
one
of
these
thin
cylinders
that
i
'm
using
to
build
up
the
big
cone
.
i
do
n't
know
the
radius
of
that
particular
cylinder
.
well
,
it
's
this
distance
here
,
and
i
know
the
y
coordinate
up
there
.
the
y
coordinate
is
x
over
2
,
so
the
radius
is
of
this
cylinder
is
x
over
2.
i
can
write
down
the
volume
of
that
disk
.
the
volume
is
pie
times
the
radius
,
which
is
x
over
2
squared
times
the
thickness
of
that
disk
which
is
dx
.
and
now
i
'm
integrating
this
from
where
to
where
?
well
x
goes
from
0
all
the
way
down
to
2
,
so
this
will
be
the
integral
from
x
equals
0
to
2
and
this
integral
will
calculate
the
volumn
of
my
cone
.
and
now
we
use
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
.
i
can
simplify
this
a
bit
,
i
have
some
constants
here
i
can
pull
out
,
right
.
i
can
pull
out
the
pie
and
i
can
pull
out
1/2
squared
.
this
is
pi
over
4
times
the
integral
from
0
to
2.
just
x
squared
dx
.
now
,
what
's
an
anti-derivative
for
x
squared
?
well
,
x
to
the
3rd
over
3.
and
then
,
i
'm
integrating
that
.
i
'm
evaluating
that
at
0
and
at
2
and
taking
the
difference
.
so
when
i
plug
in
0
,
i
do
n't
get
anything
,
but
when
i
plug
in
2
,
i
get
8.
that
's
2
cubed
over
3
,
and
then
minus
0.
so
this
is
the
volume
of
the
cone
,
which
i
could
simplify
somewhat
.
i
could
write
this
as
2
times
pi
over
3.
we
did
it
.
well
,
you
could
have
just
looked
up
this
formula
in
the
back
of
some
calculus
text
book
,
but
that
's
beside
the
point
here
,
right
.
the
point
here
is
that
we
're
teaching
you
the
secrets
of
volume
.
you
can
now
verify
that
the
formulas
in
the
back
of
the
textbook
are
correct
.
and
that
's
part
of
the
fun
of
mathematics
,
we
're
not
just
giving
you
information
.
we
're
giving
you
the
information
and
the
tools
with
which
to
verify
that
that
information
is
correct
.
