music 
weve done a bunch area 
calculations this point, so 
lets move a dimension 
think volume 
let ask, really loudly, is volume 
course, is area, right 
area is thing that 
integrals calculate 
so instead trying to give 
a definition volume, 
lets focus gonna 
compute volume, whatever is 
gonna compute volume 
integrating volume little, 
tiny pieces that we cut 
objects 
lets work an example 
heres a cone 
i want to compute volume this cone 
concreteness, lets suppose that 
cone a height two units 
a radius one unit, 
i want to compute volume 
i want to set this thing 
an integration problem 
i want to cut this thing 
slices 
add volumes little slices 
so imagine that i take this 
i slice 
a bunch really thin pieces 
whats volume a slice 
well that slice is practically 
a little tiny cylinder 
so whats volume one 
thin cylinders 
well lets suppose cylinder 
radius r 
im going to call height, 
height really thin, so 
ill call height dx 
in that case volume this 
cylinder is, whats area top 
pi r squared times height, 
is dx 
so, this here will formula 
volume one thin cylinders 
and, again, seeing 
importance differentials, right 
using differentials 
to write an equation 
volume thin cylinder 
anyhow, lets put this 
together in integral 
to set integral to 
calculate volume this cone, 
i first to figure volume 
one slices that make this cone 
to that, 
lets turn this cone side, 
lets imagine that this is point , 
so lets make this y axis, so 
x axis will head in that direction 
i here 
well, this line is line 
y equals x 
ill use that to figure 
radius one slices 
pick value x, 
lets think one slices 
one thin cylinders that 
im using to build big cone 
i dont know radius 
that particular cylinder 
well, this distance here, 
i know y coordinate there 
y coordinate is x , so 
radius is this cylinder is x 
i write volume that disk 
volume is pie times radius, 
is x squared times 
thickness that disk is dx 
im integrating 
this to 
well x goes way to , 
so this will integral 
x equals to this integral 
will calculate volumn cone 
we use fundamental 
theorem calculus 
i simplify this a bit, i 
constants here i pull out, right 
i pull pie 
i pull squared 
this is pi times 
integral to 
x squared dx 
now, whats an antiderivative 
x squared 
well, x to rd 
then, im integrating that 
im evaluating that 
taking difference 
so i plug in , i dont get anything, 
i plug in , i get 
thats cubed , minus 
so this is volume cone, 
i could simplify somewhat 
i could write this times pi 
we 
well, you could looked this 
formula in back calculus text 
book, 
thats beside point here, right 
point here is that 
teaching you secrets volume 
you verify that formulas in 
back textbook correct 
thats part fun mathematics, 
giving you information 
giving you information 
tools to verify 
that that information is correct
