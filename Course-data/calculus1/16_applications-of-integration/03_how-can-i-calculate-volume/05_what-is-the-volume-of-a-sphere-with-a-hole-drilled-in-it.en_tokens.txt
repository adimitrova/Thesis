.
let
's
compute
the
volume
of
a
bead
but
first
we
have
to
figure
out
how
we
're
going
to
build
the
bead
as
a
solid
of
revolution
.
so
start
with
the
x
,
y
plane
and
i
'm
going
to
draw
a
circle
of
radius
two
in
the
plane
.
so
,
its
a
circle
of
radius
2
if
i
take
this
and
rotate
around
the
y
axis
and
i
got
a
sphere
,
but
i
want
to
bead
,
so
i
am
going
to
imagine
drilling
out
a
hole
around
the
y
axis
.
so
to
do
that
we
can
draw
these
vertical
lines
here
.
this
is
the
line
x
equals
1.
this
is
the
line
,
x
equals
minus
1
.

okay
,
now
if
i
just
take
the
the
region
in
here
,
and
rotate
that
region
around
the
y
axis
,
that
gives
me
a
bead
.
it
's
the
same
thing
as
giving
me
a
sphere
.
with
a
hole
drilled
out
around
the
y
axis
.
we
've
got
a
choice
.
we
can
attack
this
problem
with
shells
or
with
washers
.
if
i
want
to
do
it
with
washers
,
since
i
'm
rotating
around
the
y
axis
,
i
'd
be
cutting
this
into
horizontal
strips
.
because
if
i
take
one
of
these
horizontal
strips
and
rotate
it
around
the
y
axis
,
that
gives
me
a
washer
,
and
that
looks
like
here
is
my
here
's
my
big
washer
.
and
that
's
,
that
works
.
there
's
nothing
wrong
with
that
,
but
it
turns
out
that
if
you
do
it
the
way
the
interval
that
you
get
is
kind
of
yucky
.
but
let
's
try
it
instead
with
shells
.
if
i
go
with
shells
,
then
i
'd
be
cutting
into
vertical
strips
.
parallel
to
the
axis
of
rotation
.
and
when
i
take
one
of
those
little
vertical
strips
and
rotate
it
around
.
well
then
exactly
what
i
've
got
is
,
is
one
of
these
shell
pieces
.
now
we
invoke
the
formula
for
volume
of
a
shell
in
terms
of
dx
.
so
the
formula
is
2
pi
,
the
radius
of
the
shell
.
which
if
i
think
of
just
one
of
these
pieces
say
at
x
,
the
radius
is
x
,
since
that
's
how
far
it
is
from
the
axis
of
rotation
.
the
height
of
the
shell
,
which
i
have
n't
figured
out
yet
,
times
the
thickness
of
the
shell
,
which
is
then
dx
.
now
i
need
to
determine
the
height
of
the
shell
.
so
that
big
sphere
has
radius
2.
and
this
orange
curve
is
that
circle
with
radius
2.
so
i
can
write
down
that
that
orange
curve
is
y
equals
the
square
root
of
2
squared
minus
x
squared
.
and
,
that
's
almost
enough
information
to
tell
me
the
height
of
the
shell
.
let
me
write
down
what
the
height
of
this
shell
is
,
then
,
the
height
of
the
shell
is
well
,
how
tall
is
this
thing
.
well
here
,
from
here
to
here
,
is
the
square
root
of
2
squared
minus
x
squared
,
and
then
it
's
the
same
distance
,
down
to
the
other
side
here
.
so
,
the
height
,
is
twice
this
quantity
.
so
,
i
can
write
that
down
;
2
pi
x
times
the
height
of
the
shell
,
which
is
2
times
the
square
root
of
2
squared
,
which
is
4
minus
x
squared
.
that
's
the
height
of
the
shell
,
and
then
the
thickness
of
the
shell
dx
.
let
's
think
about
the
endpoints
of
integration
.
this
purple
line
,
right
,
was
the
line
x
equals
1.
and
the
orange
circle
,
right
,
has
radius
so
,
x
can
take
values
between
1
and
2
,
and
that
tells
me
what
my
end
points
of
integration
should
be
.
so
,
this
is
the
volume
of
just
one
of
those
shells
,
and
i
'm
going
to
integrate
that
x
goes
from
1
to
2
,
to
get
all
of
the
shells
,
and
add
them
all
up
.
finally
,
we
integrate
it
's
2
pi
times
the
integral
from
1
to
2
,
and
i
'll
write
2x
,
the
square
root
of
4
minus
x
squared
dx
.
and
this
is
really
where
shells
shine
,
i
set
this
up
now
,
and
you
can
see
i
can
make
a
u
substitution
here
.
so
i
'll
set
u
equal
4
minus
x
squared
,
du
in
that
case
is
minus
2x
dx
,
put
a
minus
sign
there
and
a
minus
sign
there
.
now
i
've
got
du
square
root
of
u
,
so
this
integral
becomes
minus
2
pi
.
square
of
u
d
u
and
i
can
change
the
endpoints
,
u
goes
from
when
x
is
1
,
u
is
when
x
is
2
,
u
is
0
,
and
this
is
negative
from
3
to
0
,
so
i
can
rewrite
this
as
2
pi
the
integral
from
0
to
3
of
the
square
root
of
u
du
.
now
,
that
's
not
hard
to
do
.
i
can
rewrite
that
integrand
as
2
pi
the
interval
of
u
to
the
1/2
du
from
0
to
3.
and
i
can
easily
anti
differentiate
that
using
the
power
rule
.
so
this
is
2
pi
,
u
to
the
3
halves
over
3
halves
evaluated
at
0
and
3.
now
,
when
i
plug
in
zero
i
just
get
zero
,
so
my
answer
is
whatever
i
get
when
i
plug
in
three
.
so
the
volume
is
2
pi
times
3
to
the
3
halves
power
over
3
halves
.
now
,
instead
of
writing
3
to
the
3
halves
power
,
i
could
write
this
as
2
pi
over
3
halves
times
3
times
the
square
root
of
right
,
that
's
the
same
as
3
to
the
3
halves
power
.
but
look
,
this
3
and
this
3
cancel
and
i
'm
dividing
by
a
half
here
,
so
this
ends
up
being
4
pi
times
the
square
root
of
3.
this
is
the
volume
of
our
bead
.
we
did
it
,
but
is
the
answer
reasonable
?
well
to
think
about
how
reasonable
our
calculation
for
the
volume
of
the
bead
was
.
we
could
think
about
how
we
build
the
bead
,
alright
we
build
this
thing
by
starting
with
the
sphere
of
radius
two
and
then
drilling
out
a
tube
of
radius
one
.
so
if
i
start
with
the
sphere
of
radius
two
and
i
subtract
even
more
volume
right
,
this
cylinder
of
height
four
extends
above
the
top
of
this
sphere
and
below
the
bottom
of
the
sphere
.
so
this
is
even
more
material
than
i
removed
to
get
the
bead
.
well
that
means
that
the
volume
of
this
sphere
minus
the
volume
of
the
cylinder
's
got
to
be
even
a
little
bit
less
than
the
volume
of
the
bead
,
right
?
because
this
is
a
little
bit
more
,
material
than
the
material
that
we
removed
to
get
the
bead
.
well
how
big
are
these
three
things
?
this
thing
here
is
a
4
3rds
pie
radius
cubed
thats
the
volume
of
a
sphere
minus
this
thing
here
is
pie
r
squared
times
height
is
the
volume
of
a
cylinder
.
i
could
simplify
this
a
bit
this
is
a
4
times
8
so
that
's
32
3rd
pi
minus
4
pi
,
and
i
can
simplify
that
a
little
bit
further
even
,
that
's
20
3rd
pi
.
and
what
do
we
get
to
the
volume
of
the
big
bead
we
calculated
that
to
be
4
pi
square
root
of
3.
and
yeah
,
this
quanitiy
here
is
just
a
bit
smaller
than
this
quantity
here
.
so
,
it
seems
like
our
answer
's
reasonable
.
