music 
going to compute volume a 
sphere 
well here i got a clay sphere 
if i measure if i find that 
diameter 
diameter is centimeters 
so radius, say centimeters 
now, going to take this sphere 
crush flat 
i want to make so that 
centimeter thick 
ill estimate volume that 
blob 
so we measure this things maybe a bit 
centimeters a bit 
centimeters, a centimeter thick 
so id guess that volume is 
cubic centimeters 
that wasnt that precise 
we calculation precisely 
taking sphere, slicing 
discs thin cylinders 
integrating thin cylinders right 
thatll give us exact volume 
sphere 
so, going to take sphere 
im going to slice this thing 
lots lots little tiny cylinders 
we to figure radius 
thin cylinders 
well let draw picture again, 
alright 
heres plane, this is y axis 
x axis, ive got circle in 
xy plane 
here is sphere sitting in space 
in height call that height y 
i got a thin cylinder, i want to 
is to figure radius that thin 
cylinder 
really that amounts is figuring 
coordinates this point here 
right 
i want to figure that x 
coordinate is, so that x, y lands that 
circle 
well i know equation circle 
in xy plane 
thats x squared plus y squared equals r 
squared, r is radius sphere 
that im thinking 
i solve this x 
x equals square root r squared 
minus y squared 
this is radius this little tiny 
thin blue cylinder here 
im going to cut sphere a 
whole bunch little tiny 
cylinders 
add volume cylinders 
to give volume whole 
sphere 
i want to figure volume 
that thin cylinder 
now, whats volume this slice 
whats volume that thin cylinder 
well, pi times radius that 
cylinider, is given this 
so radius is square root r 
squared minus y squared that 
radius squared 
right, this is pi radius cylinder 
squared, times height that 
cylinder, well height that 
cylinder is dy 
so this is giving volume this 
thin cylinder 
we to think end points 
integration 
well big small y 
well y goes way here to 
minus r y goes way here to 
r 
so i set integral i want 
to integrate this, y goes minus r to 
r 
we integrate 
so first ill simplify integrand 
this is integral y goes minus r 
to r pi times square root squared, 
r squared minus y squared dy 
i simplify this a bit 
ive got a constant, always pull that 
constant 
this is pi times integral minus 
r to r r squared minus y squared dy 
ive gotta cook an antiderivative 
this 
alright, to use a fundamental term 
calculus 
so thisll pi times, so whats an 
antiderivative r squared, r is 
a constant here 
so an antiderivative that will 
r squared times y minus an 
antiderivative y squared is y cubed 
three 
ill ecaluating that r minus 
r 
if you think a bit i get 
away using to r if i multiply 
this 
thatll simplify calculation 
somewhat 
alright, i going to plug in r 
plug in 
so, i plug in r, i get r squared 
times r minus r cubed 
i plug in i get 
so i dont to subtract that 
i keep working this 
i 
i got pi r cubed minus rd r cubed 
lets call this rds cubed 
alright, so this is rd r cubed 
times pi this ends rds 
pi r cubed 
we it, yeah volume a sphere 
here a radius r 
we calculated it, rds pi r 
cubed we could reach even higher 
dimensions 
example, you could try to write 
an integral that calculates volume 
a hyper sphere 
whats a hyper sphere 
well, thats higher dimensional 
analog regular old sphere, a 
sphere is sort a stack circles 
so a hypersphere will a stack 
spheres in fourth dimension
