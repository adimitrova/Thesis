weve already used integrals to calculate 
areas 
now, i want to use integrals to calculate 
volumes 
i want to calculate volume 
complicated object 
if i cut pieces, i 
understand volume 
piece, i integrate to figure 
volume whole thing, right 
you take complicated object 
slice slabs 
you take complicated object slice 
disks 
take complicated object, slice 
washer shaped regions, right 
going to kind different 
ways 
decomposing solid objects, in order to 
calculate volumes 
this is really first example 
something general, 
there kinds problems in 
real world 
you write a, a riemann sum that 
you would 
like to able to, to calculate the, 
limit of, right 
a lot real world problems are, 
modeled this way 
if you, if you try to take limit 
a riemann sum, 
youre really trying to is to 
calculate volume an interval 
so, lots lots sort of, real world 
problems reduce to sort 
integration problem
