2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:08,785
We've already used integrals to calculate
areas and

3
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:12,980
now, I want to use integrals to calculate
volumes.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,730
I want to calculate the volume of some
complicated object.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,040
If I can cut it up into pieces, where I
understand the volume and each

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,100
piece, then I can integrate to figure out
the volume of the whole thing, right?

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,570
You can take some complicated object and
slice it up into slabs.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,952
You can take some complicated object slice
it up into disks.

9
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:35,680
Take some complicated object, slice it up
into these washer shaped regions, right?

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,935
We're going to have all kind of different
ways.

11
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:42,500
Of decomposing solid objects, in order to
calculate their volumes.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,760
And this is really the first example of
something very general,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,101
there are all kinds of problems in the
real world where

14
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,145
you can write down a, a Riemann sum that
you would

15
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:58,620
like to be able to, to calculate the, the
limit of, right?

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,720
A lot of real world problems are, are
modeled this way.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,242
And if you, if you try to take the limit
of a Riemann sum,

18
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:07,655
what you're really trying to do is to
calculate the volume of an interval.

19
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,960
So, lots and lots of sort of, real world

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,978
problems reduce down to some sort of
integration problem.
