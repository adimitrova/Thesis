we dive thinking volume 
length things, lets focus a 
bit area 
so lets find area inside here 
this orange curve is graph y equals x 
squared, this red line is 
horizontal line y equals 
so i want to figure area this 
region is red line 
orange curve 
we already know to attack a problem 
like this 
i take this region cut a 
vertical strips 
alright, im going to imagine cutting 
a whole bunch thin rectangles 
i want to add areas 
rectangles integrate 
well to set intergral, i 
say pick a value x 
think now, tall is this thin 
rectangle 
well top edge rectangle is at, 
, bottom edge is x squared 
so, height this rectangle, here 
say, is one minus x squared 
thats length here, say is minus x 
squared 
thats length here 
whats width 
well, im going to call that dx 
right, im going to imagine that 
rectangles real thin 
so, area this one 
rectangle is minus x squared, thats 
height times width dx 
i dont want area this 
one rectangle 
i want to add areas 
rectangles 
so, im going to integrate this x 
goes minus to 
alright, i get end points 
thinkin how, small large x 
in this region 
so i put a minus a there, 
this definite interval will calculate 
area this region 
i calculate that definitne 
integral 
let copy here 
integral that i want to calculate is 
integral x goes minus to 
minus x squared dx 
to calculate that integral, 
enough to use fundamental theorem 
calculus 
so ill write an antiderivitive 
x minus x cubed is an 
antiderivitive fundemental 
theorum calculus says evaluate this 
minus i take 
difference 
so, i will plug in ill get one 
minus cubed i going to 
subtract i get i plug in minus 
minus minus, minus cubed 
whats this, this is minus a third 
thats rd minus, minus plus a rd 
is negative rd, rd minus 
negative rd, is rd 
so area this region is rd 
square units, i could also this 
cutting region horizontal 
strips 
so, here i cutting this region 
horizontal rectangles, instead 
thin in terms width, 
theyre thin in terms 
height 
i want to add 
tall rectangles to compute area 
this region 
so to that im going to pick 
value y im going to think about, 
that value y, wide is is that 
rectangle 
well lets think this point 
here, right 
this is curve y equals x squared 
so this value y whats 
corresponding value x 
well square root y, that 
tells wide this whole rectangle is 
right 
this point here is negative 
square root y 
so, here to here, is square roots 
y, thats width of, this 
rectangle, let write that 
so, i got width rectangle is 
square roots y 
now, tall is that rectangle 
well, lets call that dy, right, im 
imagining that rectangle isnt 
tall, really thin 
so product squared y width, 
tall height d y 
that gives area one 
thin rectangles im going to 
integrate that 
to 
well, y could small big 

so this integral will calculate area 
this region, decomposed 
horizontal strips 
i going to that integral, i 
definitely that, right 
i this integral using 
fundamental theory calculus 
i copy that integral here 
would integrating to , 
square roots y dy, l rewrite that 
interval to y to 
half power dy 
i write an 
antiderrivitave this using 
power rule 
so an antiderrivitave is y to 
halves power, divided halves 
right, an antiderivative y to a power, 
is y to one that power, divided 
one that power 
i want to evaluate that , , 
take difference 
well, i plug in , i get 

i plug in i get , so answers 
divided , i 
rewrite rd, is area 
this region 
neat thing here is that either way, 
getting answer, i 
think this is amazing seems 
first 
i mean look, i cut 
horizontal strips i ended wanting to 
calculate this interval, interval y 
goes to square roots y dy 
i cut region 
vertical strips i wanted to 
interval x goes minus to 
minus x squared dx 
two intervals end 
equal theyre calculating 
area region, theyre 
calculating square units
