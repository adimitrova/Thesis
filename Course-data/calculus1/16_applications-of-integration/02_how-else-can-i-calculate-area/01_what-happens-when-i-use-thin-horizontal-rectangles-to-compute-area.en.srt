1
00:00:00,281 --> 00:00:04,893
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:09,315
We dive into thinking more about volume 
and length and things, let's just focus a 

3
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:13,865
bit more on area. 
So let's find the area inside here. 

4
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:18,025
This orange curve is the graph y equals x 
squared, and this red line is just the 

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:23,710
horizontal line y equals 1. 
So I want to figure out the area of this 

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,135
region which is below the red line and 
above the orange curve. 

7
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:33,495
We already know how to attack a problem 
like this. 

8
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:41,130
I take this region and cut it up into a 
vertical strips. 

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:47,094
Alright, I'm going to imagine cutting it 
up into a whole bunch of thin rectangles. 

10
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:51,743
And then I just want to add up the areas 
of those rectangles integrate. 

11
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:56,000
Well to set up the intergral, and I 
should say pick a value of x. 

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,861
And think now, how tall is this thin 
rectangle? 

13
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:09,860
Well the top edge of the rectangle is at, 
1, and the bottom edge is at x squared. 

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,210
So, the height of this rectangle, here 
say, is one minus x squared. 

15
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,807
That's the length here, say is 1 minus x 
squared. 

16
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:22,080
That's the length here. 
What's the width? 

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,620
Well, I'm just going to call that dx. 
Right, I'm going to imagine that these 

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,412
rectangles are real thin. 
So, now the area of just this one 

19
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:36,940
rectangle is 1 minus x squared, that's 
its height times its width dx. 

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,480
But I don't just want the area of this 
one rectangle. 

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,780
I want to add up the areas of all these 
rectangles. 

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,400
So, I'm going to integrate this from x 
goes minus 1 to 1. 

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,023
Alright, and I get those end points by 
thinkin about how, small and how large x 

24
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:58,035
can be in this region. 
So I put a minus 1 and a 1 there, and 

25
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,420
this definite interval will calculate the 
area of this region. 

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,180
And I can calculate that definitne 
integral. 

27
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,650
Let me just copy it down here. 
The integral that I want to calculate is 

28
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,580
the integral x goes from minus 1 to 1 of 
1 minus x squared dx. 

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,310
And to calculate that integral, it's 
enough to use the fundamental theorem of 

30
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,192
calculus. 
So I'll write down an anti-derivitive. 

31
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:25,232
x minus x cubed over 3 is an 
anti-derivitive and then the fundemental 

32
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:30,104
theorum of calculus says evaluate this at 
1 and at minus 1 and I take the 

33
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:36,134
difference. 
So, I will plug in 1 and I'll get one 

34
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:41,326
minus 1 cubed over 3 and I am going to 
subtract what I get when I plug in minus 

35
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:47,713
1 which minus 1 minus, minus 1 cubed over 
3. 

36
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:53,355
But what's this, this is 1 minus a third 
that's 2 3rd minus, minus 1 plus a 3rd 

37
00:02:53,355 --> 00:03:01,160
which is negative 2 3rd, and 2 3rd minus 
negative 2 3rd, is 4 3rd. 

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,960
So the area of this region is 4 3rd 
square units, but I could also do this by 

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,080
cutting the region up into horizontal 
strips. 

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,148
So, here I am cutting this region up into 
some horizontal rectangles, which instead 

41
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:23,635
of being thin in terms of their width, 
they're now thin in terms of their 

42
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:29,728
height. 
I just want to add up all of these not 

43
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:35,290
very tall rectangles to compute the area 
of this region. 

44
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,378
So to do that I'm going to pick some 
value of y and I'm going to think about, 

45
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:44,685
for that value of y, how wide is is that 
rectangle? 

46
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,870
Well let's think about this point over 
here, right? 

47
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,198
This is the curve y equals x squared. 
So for this value of y what's the 

48
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:57,376
corresponding value of x? 
Well it's the square root of y, and that 

49
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:02,460
tells me how wide this whole rectangle is 
right. 

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,140
And this point over here is negative the 
square root of y. 

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,604
So, from here to here, is 2 square roots 
of y, that's the width of, of this 

52
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:16,482
rectangle, let me write that down. 
So, I got the width of the rectangle is 2 

53
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:20,985
square roots of y. 
Now, how tall is that rectangle? 

54
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:24,633
Well, let's call that dy, right, I'm 
imagining that the rectangle isn't very 

55
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:29,926
tall, really thin. 
So the product 2 squared of y its width, 

56
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:35,909
and it's not very tall height d y. 
That gives me the area of one of these 

57
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,950
thin rectangles and I'm going to 
integrate that. 

58
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,950
But from where to where? 
Well, y could be as small as 0 and as big 

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,274
as 1. 
So this integral will calculate the area 

60
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:54,480
of this region, decomposed into 
horizontal strips. 

61
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,020
I was going to do that integral, but I 
can definitely do that, right? 

62
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,790
I can do this integral by using the 
fundamental theory of calculus. 

63
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,350
I just copy that integral down over here. 
It would be integrating from 0 to 1, 2 

64
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,776
square roots of y dy, l only rewrite that 
as the interval from 0 to 1 of 2y to the 

65
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:16,293
1 half power dy. 
And now I can write down an 

66
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:19,080
anti-derrivitave of this by using the 
power rule. 

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,262
So an anti-derrivitave is 2y to the 3 
halves power, divided by 3 halves. 

68
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:29,090
Right, an anti-derivative y to a power, 
is y to one more than that power, divided 

69
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,580
by one more than that power. 
I want to evaluate that at 0, and at 1, 

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,658
and take the difference. 
Well, when I plug in 1, I get 2 over 3 

71
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:44,166
over 2. 
When I plug in 0 I get 0, so the answer's 

72
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,982
2 divided by 3 over 2, which I can 
rewrite as 4 3rd, which is the area of 

73
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:54,978
this region. 
The neat thing here is that either way, 

74
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:58,695
we're getting the same answer, and I 
think this is more amazing than it seems 

75
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:02,542
at first. 
I mean look, when I cut it into 

76
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:06,763
horizontal strips I ended up wanting to 
calculate this interval, the interval y 

77
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:12,590
goes from 0 to 1 2 square roots of y dy. 
And when I cut the region up into these 

78
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,181
vertical strips I wanted to do the 
interval x goes from minus 1 to 1 of 1 

79
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:21,580
minus x squared dx. 
But these two intervals end up being 

80
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,136
equal because they're both calculating 
the area of the same region, they're both 

81
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,870
calculating 4 over 3 square units.
