weve seen that we use either 
horizontal strips vertical strips 
using integrals to calculate area 
we end computing number, 
area this region, whether we use 
vertical rectangles horizontal 
rectangles, getting 
answer, area this region 
if work, one we 
choose 
best choice depends shape 
region 
i like to think many different 
kinds edges rectangles will touch 
here is an example to demonstrate i 
mean 
ive drawn region in here three 
edges, this curved edge, this curved 
edge, this straight edge along x 
axis 
now, i could calculate area 
enclosed region 
either decomposing this vertical 
strips horizontal strips 
bad news vertical strips is 
that theres two different kinds 
vertical strips 
theres vertical strips here, 
theres vertical strips here 
vertical strips here touch 
orange purple edge, 
vertical strips here would touch 
orange blue edge 
contrast that much better 
situation that happens if i cut this 
horizontal strips 
horizontal strips an 
orange side a blue side 
i one type horizontal strip 
so i calculate area a 
region like this using horizontal strips 
lets take this advice apply to 
solve a specific problem 
so heres a bigger, specific version 
this problem 
lets figure area this region 
this orange curve is curve y equals 
square root x, this blue curve 
is y equals square root x minus 
one 
here ive got purple 
line along xaxis 
ive really got a choice to to 
approach this 
i could this vertical strips 
id to two different 
integrals 
id to handle case here 
rectangles touching orange 
line purple line 
id to an integral here 
rectangles touching 
orange line blue line 
going to better to use horizontal 
strips 
in that case, rectangles 
kind rectangle, theyre a 
rectangle one edge this orange 
curve, one edge this blue curve 
let draw one thin 
horizontal rectangles 
i to figure size that 
rectangle 
lets suppose this thin strip is 
height y 
i know tall this strip is 
ill call that dy 
wide is this green strip 
i figure this point 
this point is 
if i think a little bit, if 
this is y, i solve this equation 
find that in that case x 
is y squared, i similarly solve 
this equation find that if this 
point a y coordinate y, x 
coordinate will y squared plus 
that tells width this green 
rectangle, this minus this 
im going to write area that 
green rectangle 
so width is y squared plus 
minus y squared, thats wide this 
rectangle is 
height that rectangle is dy, 
so this product is area that green 
rectangle 
course i dont care 
that one rectangle, i want to integrate 
so that im adding areas 
kinds thin rectangles 
in limit im getting 
area this region exactly 
so instead this single rectangle, 
im going to integrate y goes 
to 
well, i look picture here, y 
small zero tall this 
point here is one 
so y goes zero to one this 
interval calculates area that 
region 
lets calculation 
this integral is integral to 
i simplify integrand a bit 
half minus y squared dy 
we write an antiderivative 
that 
so i add a derivative half 
one half y a derivative y squared 
is y cubed 
im going to evaluate that , 
take a difference 
i plug in i get 
so answer is whatever i get i 
plug in 
thats half times , minus cubed 

could simplify that a bit, thats half 
minus a th, half, well, thats 
ths, so ths minus th, is ths, 
you might write as, rd 
so area that, shark fin shaped 
region is a third a square unit 
often, there right ways 
wrong ways there better ways 
worse ways, right 
ways that better in that 
quicker, safer, elegant 
so dont make good choices 
make best choices
