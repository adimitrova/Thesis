[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,410
We've seen that we can use either 
horizontal strips or vertical strips when 

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,971
using integrals to calculate area. 
We end up computing the same number, the 

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,924
area of this region, whether we use 
vertical rectangles or horizontal 

5
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:25,270
rectangles, we're getting the same 
answer, the area of this region. 

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,490
But if both work, which one should we 
choose? 

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,790
The best choice depends on the shape of 
the region. 

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,715
I like to think about how many different 
kinds of edges my rectangles will touch. 

9
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,770
Here is an example to demonstrate what I 
mean. 

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,800
I've drawn some region in here with three 
edges, this curved edge, this curved 

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,605
edge, and this straight edge along the x 
axis. 

12
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:49,120
Now, I could calculate the area of the 
enclosed region. 

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,640
Either by decomposing this into vertical 
strips or horizontal strips. 

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,849
The bad news about vertical strips is 
that there's two different kinds of 

15
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:03,857
vertical strips. 
There's vertical strips over here, and 

16
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:07,662
there's vertical strips over here. 
The vertical strips over here touch the 

17
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,478
orange and the purple edge, and the 
vertical strips over here would touch the 

18
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,122
orange and the blue edge. 
Contrast that with the much better 

19
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:20,640
situation that happens if I cut this up 
into horizontal strips. 

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,800
All of my horizontal strips have an 
orange side and a blue side. 

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,316
I only have one type of horizontal strip. 
So I should calculate the area of a 

22
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:37,367
region like this using horizontal strips. 
Let's take this advice and apply it to 

23
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:41,892
solve a specific problem. 
So here's a bigger, specific version of 

24
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:46,090
this problem. 
Let's figure out the area of this region. 

25
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,034
this orange curve is the curve y equals 
the square root of x, and this blue curve 

26
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:54,310
is y equals the square root of 2x minus 
one. 

27
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,790
And then here I've just got the purple 
line along the x-axis. 

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,020
I've really got a choice as to how to 
approach this. 

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,260
I could do this with vertical strips. 
But then I'd have to do two different 

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,000
integrals. 
I'd have to handle the case over here 

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,250
where rectangles are touching the orange 
line and the purple line. 

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,337
And I'd have to do an integral over here 
where my rectangles are touching the 

33
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:21,301
orange line and the blue line. 
It's going to be better to use horizontal 

34
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,088
strips. 
In that case, all of the rectangles are 

35
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:27,175
the same kind of rectangle, they're a 
rectangle with one edge on this orange 

36
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:33,125
curve, and one edge on this blue curve. 
Let me just draw one of those thin 

37
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:37,541
horizontal rectangles. 
I have to figure out the size of that 

38
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,520
rectangle. 
Let's suppose this thin strip is at 

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,060
height y. 
I know how tall this strip is. 

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,940
I'll call that dy. 
But how wide is this green strip? 

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,860
I should figure out what this point and 
where this point is. 

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,074
And if I think about it a little bit, if 
this is y, I can solve this equation and 

43
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:05,544
find out that in that case x. 
Is y squared, and I can similarly solve 

44
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:10,880
this equation and find out that if this 
point has a y coordinate y, the x 

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,522
coordinate will be y squared plus 1 over 
2. 

46
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:26,080
And that tells me the width of this green 
rectangle, it's this minus this. 

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,470
I'm going to write down the area of that 
green rectangle. 

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,102
So the width is y squared plus 1 over 2 
minus y squared, that's how wide this 

49
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:40,708
rectangle is. 
And the height of that rectangle is dy, 

50
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,875
so this product is the area of that green 
rectangle. 

51
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,347
But of course I don't care just about 
that one rectangle, I want to integrate 

52
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:53,120
so that I'm adding up the areas of all 
kinds of thin rectangles. 

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,300
And then in the limit I'm getting the 
area of this region exactly. 

54
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,722
So instead of just this single rectangle, 
I'm going to integrate y goes from where 

55
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:04,424
to where. 
Well, I look at my picture here, y can be 

56
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:10,430
as small as zero and as tall as this 
point up here which is one. 

57
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,722
So y goes from zero to one and this 
interval calculates the area of that 

58
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:18,399
region. 
Let's do the calculation. 

59
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,140
This integral is the integral from 0 to 
1. 

60
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:29,516
for I can simplify the integrand a bit. 
It's 1 half minus y squared over 2 dy . 

61
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:35,010
And now we can write an antiderivative 
for that. 

62
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,232
So I add a derivative of 1 half. 
One half y and a derivative of y squared 

63
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:46,220
over 2 is y cubed over 6. 
I'm going to evaluate that at 0 and 1, 

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,430
take a difference. 
But when I plug in 0 I just get 0. 

65
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,430
So the answer is whatever I get when I 
plug in 1. 

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,822
And that's 1 half times 1, minus 1 cubed 
over 6. 

67
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:05,158
Could simplify that a bit, that's 1 half 
minus a 6th, and 1 half, well, that's 3 

68
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:14,830
6ths, so 3 6ths minus 1 6th, is 2 6ths, 
which you might write as, 1 3rd. 

69
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,770
So the area of that, shark fin shaped 
region is a third of a square unit. 

70
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,735
Often, it's not there are right ways or 
wrong ways but there are better ways and 

71
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:29,380
worse ways, right. 
Ways that are better in that they are 

72
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,100
quicker, safer, more elegant. 
So don't just make good choices. 

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:45,688
Make the best choices.
