we
've
seen
that
we
can
use
either
horizontal
strips
or
vertical
strips
when
using
integrals
to
calculate
area
.
we
end
up
computing
the
same
number
,
the
area
of
this
region
,
whether
we
use
vertical
rectangles
or
horizontal
rectangles
,
we
're
getting
the
same
answer
,
the
area
of
this
region
.
but
if
both
work
,
which
one
should
we
choose
?
the
best
choice
depends
on
the
shape
of
the
region
.
i
like
to
think
about
how
many
different
kinds
of
edges
my
rectangles
will
touch
.
here
is
an
example
to
demonstrate
what
i
mean
.
i
've
drawn
some
region
in
here
with
three
edges
,
this
curved
edge
,
this
curved
edge
,
and
this
straight
edge
along
the
x
axis
.
now
,
i
could
calculate
the
area
of
the
enclosed
region
.
either
by
decomposing
this
into
vertical
strips
or
horizontal
strips
.
the
bad
news
about
vertical
strips
is
that
there
's
two
different
kinds
of
vertical
strips
.
there
's
vertical
strips
over
here
,
and
there
's
vertical
strips
over
here
.
the
vertical
strips
over
here
touch
the
orange
and
the
purple
edge
,
and
the
vertical
strips
over
here
would
touch
the
orange
and
the
blue
edge
.
contrast
that
with
the
much
better
situation
that
happens
if
i
cut
this
up
into
horizontal
strips
.
all
of
my
horizontal
strips
have
an
orange
side
and
a
blue
side
.
i
only
have
one
type
of
horizontal
strip
.
so
i
should
calculate
the
area
of
a
region
like
this
using
horizontal
strips
.
let
's
take
this
advice
and
apply
it
to
solve
a
specific
problem
.
so
here
's
a
bigger
,
specific
version
of
this
problem
.
let
's
figure
out
the
area
of
this
region
.
this
orange
curve
is
the
curve
y
equals
the
square
root
of
x
,
and
this
blue
curve
is
y
equals
the
square
root
of
2x
minus
one
.
and
then
here
i
've
just
got
the
purple
line
along
the
x-axis
.
i
've
really
got
a
choice
as
to
how
to
approach
this
.
i
could
do
this
with
vertical
strips
.
but
then
i
'd
have
to
do
two
different
integrals
.
i
'd
have
to
handle
the
case
over
here
where
rectangles
are
touching
the
orange
line
and
the
purple
line
.
and
i
'd
have
to
do
an
integral
over
here
where
my
rectangles
are
touching
the
orange
line
and
the
blue
line
.
it
's
going
to
be
better
to
use
horizontal
strips
.
in
that
case
,
all
of
the
rectangles
are
the
same
kind
of
rectangle
,
they
're
a
rectangle
with
one
edge
on
this
orange
curve
,
and
one
edge
on
this
blue
curve
.
let
me
just
draw
one
of
those
thin
horizontal
rectangles
.
i
have
to
figure
out
the
size
of
that
rectangle
.
let
's
suppose
this
thin
strip
is
at
height
y.
i
know
how
tall
this
strip
is
.
i
'll
call
that
dy
.
but
how
wide
is
this
green
strip
?
i
should
figure
out
what
this
point
and
where
this
point
is
.
and
if
i
think
about
it
a
little
bit
,
if
this
is
y
,
i
can
solve
this
equation
and
find
out
that
in
that
case
x.
is
y
squared
,
and
i
can
similarly
solve
this
equation
and
find
out
that
if
this
point
has
a
y
coordinate
y
,
the
x
coordinate
will
be
y
squared
plus
1
over
and
that
tells
me
the
width
of
this
green
rectangle
,
it
's
this
minus
this
.
i
'm
going
to
write
down
the
area
of
that
green
rectangle
.
so
the
width
is
y
squared
plus
1
over
2
minus
y
squared
,
that
's
how
wide
this
rectangle
is
.
and
the
height
of
that
rectangle
is
dy
,
so
this
product
is
the
area
of
that
green
rectangle
.
but
of
course
i
do
n't
care
just
about
that
one
rectangle
,
i
want
to
integrate
so
that
i
'm
adding
up
the
areas
of
all
kinds
of
thin
rectangles
.
and
then
in
the
limit
i
'm
getting
the
area
of
this
region
exactly
.
so
instead
of
just
this
single
rectangle
,
i
'm
going
to
integrate
y
goes
from
where
to
where
.
well
,
i
look
at
my
picture
here
,
y
can
be
as
small
as
zero
and
as
tall
as
this
point
up
here
which
is
one
.
so
y
goes
from
zero
to
one
and
this
interval
calculates
the
area
of
that
region
.
let
's
do
the
calculation
.
this
integral
is
the
integral
from
0
to
for
i
can
simplify
the
integrand
a
bit
.
it
's
1
half
minus
y
squared
over
2
dy
.
and
now
we
can
write
an
antiderivative
for
that
.
so
i
add
a
derivative
of
1
half
.
one
half
y
and
a
derivative
of
y
squared
over
2
is
y
cubed
over
6.
i
'm
going
to
evaluate
that
at
0
and
1
,
take
a
difference
.
but
when
i
plug
in
0
i
just
get
0.
so
the
answer
is
whatever
i
get
when
i
plug
in
1.
and
that
's
1
half
times
1
,
minus
1
cubed
over
6.
could
simplify
that
a
bit
,
that
's
1
half
minus
a
6th
,
and
1
half
,
well
,
that
's
3
6ths
,
so
3
6ths
minus
1
6th
,
is
2
6ths
,
which
you
might
write
as
,
1
3rd
.
so
the
area
of
that
,
shark
fin
shaped
region
is
a
third
of
a
square
unit
.
often
,
it
's
not
there
are
right
ways
or
wrong
ways
but
there
are
better
ways
and
worse
ways
,
right
.
ways
that
are
better
in
that
they
are
quicker
,
safer
,
more
elegant
.
so
do
n't
just
make
good
choices
.
make
the
best
choices
.
