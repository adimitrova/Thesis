[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:09,361
We defined arc length using an integral. 
The integral that we'll be using is this 

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,916
one. 
I'm going to be integrating from a to b 

4
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:16,370
the square root of 1 plus the derivative 
squared dx. 

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,230
Let's apply this to a specific problem. 
Let's compute the arc length of a little 

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,272
piece of a graph. 
So let's look at the graph of y squared 

7
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:30,730
equals x cubed and figure out the length 
of this arc from 0,0 to 1,1. 

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,707
Now I could rewrite this equation. 
Instead of writing y squared equals x 

9
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:40,080
cubed, I could write y equals x to the 3 
halves power. 

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,060
We'll start by differentiating. 
So because of this, I can write dy, dx is 

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,517
3 halves x to the 1 half power. 
We'll put that derivative into the 

12
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:58,080
formula for arc length so I'm going to be 
integrating. 

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,530
X goes from 0 to 1, the square root of 1 
plus this derivative squared. 

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,870
So, I'll write 3 halves, x to the 1 half 
squared dx. 

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,892
Now, I just want to compute that 
integral. 

16
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:17,280
But how? 
Well, I can rewrite the integrand. 

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,887
This is the integral from 0 to 1 of the 
square root of 1 plus 3 halves squared is 

18
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:29,307
9 4ths. 
And x to the one half squared, I'll write 

19
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:33,560
x, dx. 
Just have no fear, keep going. 

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,706
Well, I could use substitution. 
u equals 1 plus 9 4ths x so that du is 9 

21
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:48,302
4ths x or alternatively, dx is 4 9ths du. 
And that means this integral, it's the 

22
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:55,726
same as the integral of square root of u 
times 4 9ths du and remind you bounce of 

23
00:01:55,726 --> 00:02:05,960
integration. 
Well an x is 0, u is 1 and when x is 1 u 

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,760
is 14 4ths. 
Alright, now I just have to write down an 

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,745
anti derivative here, well I could write 
this as 4 9th, u to the 3 halves over 3 

26
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:29,764
halves that's an anti-derivative for 
square root 2, evaluated at 1 and 13 4th. 

27
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,420
So I'm just going to plug in 13 4th plug 
in 1, take the difference. 

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:44,029
Okay, so this is 4 9th, I write, times 2 
3rd, instead of dividing by 3 halves. 

29
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:51,280
Times 13 4th. 
To the 3 halves power minus 4 9th times 2 

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,980
3rd times 1 to the 3 halves power and I 
got to simplify this little bit more even 

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,821
lets see here. 
4 times 2 is 8, okay that's also 4 to the 

32
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:12,565
3 halves power. 
So I can cancel all of these things. 

33
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:16,180
And then I can simplify gotta do some 
arithmetic here. 

34
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,620
So I've got what, 13 to the 3 halves 
power divided by 9 times 3 is 27, minus, 

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:33,599
this is 8 27ths just times 1. 
And, if you don't like the 3 halves here, 

36
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,720
I could write this as 13 times the square 
root of 13 over 27 minus 8 over 27. 

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,444
This, is the length of that arc. 
We did it, but it worked out almost too 

38
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,068
well. 
Alright that's the sad thing about arc 

39
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:51,401
length calculations. 
Because the arc length formula involves 

40
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:56,070
that square root of 1 plus a derivative 
squared, it's extraordinarily unlikely. 

41
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,020
And if you just give me some random 
function, I'm going to succeed in being 

42
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,983
able to evaluate that integral. 
The sorts of things we can calculate the 

43
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:06,900
arc length of are pretty special sorts of 
things.
