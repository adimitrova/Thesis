we defined arc length using an integral 
integral that well using is this 
one 
im going to integrating a to b 
square root plus derivative 
squared dx 
lets apply this to a specific problem 
lets compute arc length a little 
piece a graph 
so lets look graph y squared 
equals x cubed figure length 
this arc , to , 
i could rewrite this equation 
instead writing y squared equals x 
cubed, i could write y equals x to 
halves power 
well start differentiating 
so this, i write dy, dx is 
halves x to half power 
well put that derivative 
formula arc length so im going to 
integrating 
x goes to , square root 
plus this derivative squared 
so, ill write halves, x to half 
squared dx 
now, i want to compute that 
integral 

well, i rewrite integrand 
this is integral to 
square root plus halves squared is 
ths 
x to one half squared, ill write 
x, dx 
fear, keep going 
well, i could use substitution 
u equals plus ths x so that du is 
ths x alternatively, dx is ths du 
that means this integral, 
integral square root u 
times ths du remind you bounce 
integration 
well an x is , u is x is u 
is ths 
alright, i to write an 
anti derivative here, well i could write 
this th, u to halves 
halves thats an antiderivative 
square root , evaluated th 
so im going to plug in th plug 
in , take difference 
okay, so this is th, i write, times 
rd, instead dividing halves 
times th 
to halves power minus th times 
rd times to halves power i 
got to simplify this little bit even 
lets see here 
times is , okay thats also to 
halves power 
so i cancel things 
i simplify gotta 
arithmetic here 
so ive got what, to halves 
power divided times is , minus, 
this is ths times 
and, if you dont like halves here, 
i could write this times square 
root minus 
this, is length that arc 
we it, worked almost 
well 
alright thats sad thing arc 
length calculations 
arc length formula involves 
that square root plus a derivative 
squared, extraordinarily unlikely 
if you give random 
function, im going to succeed in 
able to evaluate that integral 
sorts things we calculate 
arc length pretty special sorts 
things
