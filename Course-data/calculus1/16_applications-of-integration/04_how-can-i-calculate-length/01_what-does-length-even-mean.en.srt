[MUSIC].

00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:10,679
Here's a little puzzle about length. 
I've got an isocoles right triangle. 

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,967
And let's say that both of the legs of 
this right triangle have the same length 

4
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,968
1. 
And we know the length of the hypotenuse 

5
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:22,041
by the Pythagroem theorem. 
Well, that tells us that this length is 

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,619
the square root of 2. 
But let's try to think about this 

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,568
differently. 
What if, instead of a smooth ramp, I made 

8
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,836
stairs. 
I mean, instead of this ramp picture, I 

9
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:36,410
have a picture like this, right. 
A staircase. 

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,880
What's the length of the staircase. 
The total length of the staircase is 2. 

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,480
To see that, just look at the horizontal 
sections of the stairs. 

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,880
That's the same as the entire bottom 
edge. 

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,020
And the vertical sections of the 
staircase is the same as this whole edge. 

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,171
So 1 plus 1 is 2. 
What happens if I make those stairs even 

15
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:03,360
smaller? 
The length is still 2. 

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,638
Because again, all of the vertical 
sections of the staircase add up to this 

17
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:11,406
length. 
And all of the horizontal sections of the 

18
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:16,190
staircase, and I'm[UNKNOWN] pushing them 
all down, add up to this length. 

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,230
So, the total length of the staircase is 
still 2. 

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,200
What happens if I make those stairs 
really small? 

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,958
Well, even if the stairs are really, 
really small, the total length of the 

22
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:33,910
staircase is still 2. 
What is going on here? 

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,300
The length of the ramp is a square root 
of 2. 

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,145
The length of the staircase is 2. 
No matter how small I make the stairs, 

25
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:45,240
even if I made each stair the size of a 
proton, the staircase would still have 

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,609
length too. 
The point is that even something as 

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,940
seemingly obvious as length, is more 
subtle than I think we give it credit 

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,732
for. 
What we really need is some sort of 

29
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:02,500
definition of length. 
We'll do it in terms of an integral. 

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,509
So just like with volume or with area, 
I'm going to take this thing that I'm 

31
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,828
interested in, say the length here. 
And try to break it up into little pieces 

32
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:15,746
that I'll then add up with an integral. 
So let's imagine that I cut this up into 

33
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:21,754
little tiny pieces and that I just 
connect these by straight lines. 

34
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:26,902
And then I can just add up the length of 
these little tiny straight lines and call 

35
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:33,920
that, in the limit, after I integrate, 
the length of this curve. 

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,565
I want to write down an integral that 
captures that intuition. 

37
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,410
Well, let's just look at one little piece 
of this thing here. 

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,950
let's write a little triangle there so i 
can call the change in x dx, and the 

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,220
change in y dy and what I'm interested in 
is how long this little green line 

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,386
segment is. 
Well, you might think then that little 

41
00:02:56,386 --> 00:03:01,902
green line segment has the length square 
root dx squared plus dy squared. 

42
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:06,322
And then you integrate to get the total 
arc length, just play around with that a 

43
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:10,233
little bit. 
Specifically lets imagine pulling a dx 

44
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,289
outside of this. 
So when I get this is the intergral. 

45
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,655
The square root of 1 plus, and if I 
factor out a dx here, I have to include a 

46
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:24,461
dx in the denominator there. 
And this has the advantage at least of 

47
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:29,493
now looking like the derivative, right, 
dy over dx, that's how I've been denoting 

48
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:37,060
the derivative, and this form is the sort 
of thing that I can integate. 

49
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,955
So here's the formula that we're going to 
use. 

50
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:44,755
The arc length from a f of a to b f of b 
along the graph of f is the integral x 

51
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:51,355
goes a to b of the square root of 1 plus 
the derivative squared and that's exactly 

52
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:59,016
what I saw here dx. 
I hope that you're feeling just a little 

53
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,924
bit uneasy at this point. 
I'm really treating dx and dy as if 

54
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,157
they're legitimate mathematical objects, 
and you should be a little bit 

55
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:08,190
uncomfortable with that at this point.
