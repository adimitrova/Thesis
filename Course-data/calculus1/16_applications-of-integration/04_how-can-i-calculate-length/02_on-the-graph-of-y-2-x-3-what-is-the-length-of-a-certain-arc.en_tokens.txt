we
defined
arc
length
using
an
integral
.
the
integral
that
we
'll
be
using
is
this
one
.
i
'm
going
to
be
integrating
from
a
to
b
the
square
root
of
1
plus
the
derivative
squared
dx
.
let
's
apply
this
to
a
specific
problem
.
let
's
compute
the
arc
length
of
a
little
piece
of
a
graph
.
so
let
's
look
at
the
graph
of
y
squared
equals
x
cubed
and
figure
out
the
length
of
this
arc
from
0,0
to
1,1.
now
i
could
rewrite
this
equation
.
instead
of
writing
y
squared
equals
x
cubed
,
i
could
write
y
equals
x
to
the
3
halves
power
.
we
'll
start
by
differentiating
.
so
because
of
this
,
i
can
write
dy
,
dx
is
3
halves
x
to
the
1
half
power
.
we
'll
put
that
derivative
into
the
formula
for
arc
length
so
i
'm
going
to
be
integrating
.
x
goes
from
0
to
1
,
the
square
root
of
1
plus
this
derivative
squared
.
so
,
i
'll
write
3
halves
,
x
to
the
1
half
squared
dx
.
now
,
i
just
want
to
compute
that
integral
.
but
how
?
well
,
i
can
rewrite
the
integrand
.
this
is
the
integral
from
0
to
1
of
the
square
root
of
1
plus
3
halves
squared
is
9
4ths
.
and
x
to
the
one
half
squared
,
i
'll
write
x
,
dx
.
just
have
no
fear
,
keep
going
.
well
,
i
could
use
substitution
.
u
equals
1
plus
9
4ths
x
so
that
du
is
9
4ths
x
or
alternatively
,
dx
is
4
9ths
du
.
and
that
means
this
integral
,
it
's
the
same
as
the
integral
of
square
root
of
u
times
4
9ths
du
and
remind
you
bounce
of
integration
.
well
an
x
is
0
,
u
is
1
and
when
x
is
1
u
is
14
4ths
.
alright
,
now
i
just
have
to
write
down
an
anti
derivative
here
,
well
i
could
write
this
as
4
9th
,
u
to
the
3
halves
over
3
halves
that
's
an
anti-derivative
for
square
root
2
,
evaluated
at
1
and
13
4th
.
so
i
'm
just
going
to
plug
in
13
4th
plug
in
1
,
take
the
difference
.
okay
,
so
this
is
4
9th
,
i
write
,
times
2
3rd
,
instead
of
dividing
by
3
halves
.
times
13
4th
.
to
the
3
halves
power
minus
4
9th
times
2
3rd
times
1
to
the
3
halves
power
and
i
got
to
simplify
this
little
bit
more
even
lets
see
here
.
4
times
2
is
8
,
okay
that
's
also
4
to
the
3
halves
power
.
so
i
can
cancel
all
of
these
things
.
and
then
i
can
simplify
got
ta
do
some
arithmetic
here
.
so
i
've
got
what
,
13
to
the
3
halves
power
divided
by
9
times
3
is
27
,
minus
,
this
is
8
27ths
just
times
1.
and
,
if
you
do
n't
like
the
3
halves
here
,
i
could
write
this
as
13
times
the
square
root
of
13
over
27
minus
8
over
27.
this
,
is
the
length
of
that
arc
.
we
did
it
,
but
it
worked
out
almost
too
well
.
alright
that
's
the
sad
thing
about
arc
length
calculations
.
because
the
arc
length
formula
involves
that
square
root
of
1
plus
a
derivative
squared
,
it
's
extraordinarily
unlikely
.
and
if
you
just
give
me
some
random
function
,
i
'm
going
to
succeed
in
being
able
to
evaluate
that
integral
.
the
sorts
of
things
we
can
calculate
the
arc
length
of
are
pretty
special
sorts
of
things
.
