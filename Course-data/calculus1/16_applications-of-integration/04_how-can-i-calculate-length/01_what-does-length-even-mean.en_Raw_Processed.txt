heres a little puzzle length 
ive got an isocoles right triangle 
lets say that legs 
this right triangle length 
we know length hypotenuse 
pythagroem theorem 
well, that tells us that this length is 
square root 
lets try to think this 
differently 
if, instead a smooth ramp, i made 
stairs 
i mean, instead this ramp picture, i 
a picture like this, right 
a staircase 
whats length staircase 
total length staircase is 
to see that, look horizontal 
sections stairs 
thats entire bottom 
edge 
vertical sections 
staircase is this whole edge 
so plus is 
happens if i make stairs even 
smaller 
length is still 
again, vertical 
sections staircase add to this 
length 
horizontal sections 
staircase, imunknown pushing 
down, add to this length 
so, total length staircase is 
still 
happens if i make stairs 
really small 
well, even if stairs really, 
really small, total length 
staircase is still 
is going here 
length ramp is a square root 

length staircase is 
matter small i make stairs, 
even if i made stair size a 
proton, staircase would still 
length 
point is that even something 
seemingly obvious length, is 
subtle i think we give credit 

we really need is sort 
definition length 
well in terms an integral 
so like volume area, 
im going to take this thing that im 
interested in, say length here 
try to break little pieces 
that ill add an integral 
so lets imagine that i cut this 
little tiny pieces that i 
connect straight lines 
i add length 
little tiny straight lines call 
that, in limit, i integrate, 
length this curve 
i want to write an integral that 
captures that intuition 
well, lets look one little piece 
this thing here 
lets write a little triangle there so i 
call change in x dx, 
change in y dy im interested in 
is long this little green line 
segment is 
well, you might think that little 
green line segment length square 
root dx squared plus dy squared 
you integrate to get total 
arc length, play around that a 
little bit 
specifically lets imagine pulling a dx 
outside this 
so i get this is intergral 
square root plus, if i 
factor a dx here, i to include a 
dx in denominator there 
this advantage least 
looking like derivative, right, 
dy dx, thats ive denoting 
derivative, this form is sort 
thing that i integate 
so heres formula that going to 
use 
arc length a f a to b f b 
along graph f is integral x 
goes a to b square root plus 
derivative squared thats exactly 
i saw here dx 
i hope that youre feeling a little 
bit uneasy this point 
im really treating dx dy if 
theyre legitimate mathematical objects, 
you a little bit 
uncomfortable that this point
