1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,650
[MUSIC] We're going to sneak up on a 
certain fact. 

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,320
I want to show that pi is less than 22 
sevenths. 

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,735
These are awfully close. 
Pi is about 3.1416. 

4
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:17,330
And 22 seventh is about 3.1429. 
Alright? 

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,490
These are awfully close. 
And we'll do it with an[UNKNOWN]. 

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:26,216
I'm just going to make something up, and 
it'll turn out in retrospect to be 

7
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:31,949
exactly what we need. 
So the trick's going to be, do the 

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,882
integral from 0 to 1 of x to the fourth. 
Times one minus x to the fourth all over 

9
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:45,260
one plus x squared dx. 
How do I integrate that? 

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,284
Well, before we actually do the 
calculation, let's notice something about 

11
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:53,190
the integrand. 
the denominator here is positive. 

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,411
And the numerator, well as long as x 
isn't 0 or 1, the numerator's positive as 

13
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,892
well. 
It's continuous and I'm integrating a 

14
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:05,640
continuous function that's mostly 
positive except at the end point. 

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,300
So that means that this integral ends up 
being positive as well. 

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,426
We'll need that fact later. 
The, the fact that the integral's 

17
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:16,062
positive. 
But let's work now on the integrand. 

18
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to focus first on the 
numerator. 

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,908
1 minus x to the fourth. 
If I just multiply this out I get x to 

20
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:33,257
the fourth minus 4x cubed plus 6x squared 
minus 4x plus 1. 

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,965
And now if I multiply this by x to the 
fourth, that just adds 4 to each of these 

22
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:45,391
exponents. 
This will be x to the eighth minus 4 x to 

23
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:54,420
the seventh, plus 6 x to the sixth, minus 
4 x to the fifth, plus x to the fourth. 

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,762
Let's get ready to do some long division. 
So I'm just going to copy this down. 

25
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:03,412
So, what did I get as the numerator, what 
was x to the fourth times 1 minus x to 

26
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:08,038
the fourth. 
Expand it out, was x to the eight minus 

27
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,910
4x to the seventh plus 6x to the sixth 
minus 4x to the fifth. 

28
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,273
Plus x to the fourth, and I'm going to 
take that numerator and I divide it by 

29
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:21,470
one plus x squared, so this we're 
going to do long division. 

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,938
I'm dividing this by, I write it as x 
squared plus one. 

31
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so that's the calculation I want to 
do. 

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,271
I want to do this long division problem. 
Well I gotta put something up here that I 

33
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,420
multiply by x squared plus 1 to kill x to 
the 8th. 

34
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,450
And, for that I could use x to the 6th, 
because x to the 6th times x squared is x 

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,674
to the eighth. 
And x to the sixth times 1, which is plus 

36
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:47,216
x to the 6th. 
And I'm going to subtract that, and what 

37
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,178
do I get? 
Well, the x to the 8th terms cancel, and 

38
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:54,766
I've got a minus 4x to the 7th. 
6x to the sixth minus x to the sixth is 5 

39
00:02:54,766 --> 00:03:00,077
x to the sixth minus 4 x to the fifth and 
plus x to the fourth. 

40
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:04,550
Those survive and I'm subtracting 
anything as soon as copy them down, minus 

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,956
4 x to the fifth plus x to the fourth. 
Alright, now you gotta put something up 

42
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:15,430
here that I can multiply by x squared 
plus 1 to your minus 4 x to the seventh. 

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,464
but minus 4x to the fifth. 
because, that times x squared gives me 

44
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:27,050
minus 4x to the seventh and that times 1 
gives me ooh, minus 4x to the fifth. 

45
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,890
That's Great! 
So this term dies and this term dies and 

46
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,450
let's copy down the terms actually it's 
5x to the sixth. 

47
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,341
Plus x to the fourth. 
Now what do I put up here to multiply by 

48
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:42,042
this to kill this? 
plus five x to the fourth will do it, 

49
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:46,242
because that times x squared gives me 
five x to the sixth, and five x to the 

50
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:51,554
fourth times one gives me plus 5x to the 
fourth. 

51
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:56,000
And remember, I'm subtracting this. 
So that kills this first term. 

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,960
But here I've got what minus 4x to the 
fourth. 

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,590
I'm going to write that over here. 
So, minus 4x to the fourth is all that's 

54
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,856
left. 
I've gotta put something up here to 

55
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:08,977
multiply by this to kill this. 
How about minus 4x squared, because that 

56
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:13,270
times this gives me minus 4x to the 
fourth. 

57
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,100
And then minus 4x squared. 
I'm subtracting this so this becomes just 

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,210
4x squared. 
I've got to put something here to 

59
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,324
multiply by this to kill this. 
Well plus 4 will do it. 

60
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:31,240
Plus 4 times that gives me 4x squared 
plus 4. 

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,900
And when I subtract this I get minus four 
left over and that's my remainder. 

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,342
Now we can rewrite the integral. 
So in light of the expansion of the 

63
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:44,478
numerator and the long division after I 
divided by 1 plus x squared. 

64
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,050
This is the integral from 0 to 1. 
Of, well, what did I get when I divided? 

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,534
Was x to the sixth minus four x to the 
fifth plus five x to the fourth minus 

66
00:04:54,534 --> 00:05:00,891
four x squared. 
Plus four and then I had a remainder so 

67
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:07,480
minus four over one plus x squared. 
This is an integral I can do. 

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,220
Okay this is x to the seventh over seven. 
That is the anti-derivative x to the 

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,345
sixth. 
the anti-derivative here is four x to the 

70
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:21,820
sixth over six. 
Plus an antiderivative here. 

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:29,487
It's just x to the fifth, antiderivative 
here is minus 4 x to the third over 3. 

72
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:33,455
Antiderivative of 4 is just plus 4x, and 
an antiderivative of 4 over 1 plus x 

73
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:39,400
squared, well the antiderivative of 1 
over 1 plus x squared's arctan. 

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,841
So this is minus 4, orcten x and I'm 
integrating from 0 to 1, so I'm just 

75
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:55,110
going to evaluate this from 0 to 1. 
Now, what do I get when I evaluate this? 

76
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,481
When I plug in 0, I get 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. 
And arctan of 0 is 0. 

77
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:05,170
So, I end up just subtracting 0. 
So I only have to just evaluate this at 1 

78
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,220
to figure out what this integral is equal 
to. 

79
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:17,711
So when I plug in 1, I get 1 seventh. 
Minus 4 sixths plus one minus 4 thirds 

80
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:25,334
plus 4 minus 4 times, and what's arctan 
of 1, well arctan of is pi over 4, let's 

81
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:32,104
simplify a bit. 
So, I've got 1 seventh, and I'll put all 

82
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:38,240
these with a common denominator of three. 
So, minus 2 thirds plus 3 thirds minus 4 

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,243
thirds plus 12 thirds, and then minus 4 
times pi over 4 is just minus pi. 

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,350
Well now what do I have? 
let's see here. 

85
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,372
So I've got minus 2 minus 4 that's minus 
6 thirds, 3 plus 12, that's 15 thirds 

86
00:06:55,372 --> 00:07:02,022
minus 6 thirds. 
That gives me 9 thirds leftover, and then 

87
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,796
also minus pi. 
So I've got a seventh. 

88
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:16,025
Plus, well 9 thirds is just 3 minus pi. 
Well 1 seventh plus 3 that's 22 sevenths 

89
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:20,664
minus pi. 
Here's the significance of this, remember 

90
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:24,288
back to the beginning. 
Well way back at the beginning I pointed 

91
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:28,620
out that this integral is positive. 
So what have we shown? 

92
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,790
So we've shown that this, the value of 
the integral is positive. 

93
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,476
In other words, that 22 sevenths is 
bigger than pi. 

94
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,442
So this is really a fun example. 
We've got all these pieces coming 

95
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,946
together. 
We've got the derivative of arctan, long 

96
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:47,900
division of polynomials, the fundamental 
theorem of calculus. 

97
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,716
All these forces combining to convince us 
that 22 sevenths is bigger than pi. 

98
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:57,636
So if you want an entertaining challenge, 
here is an even more complicated integral 

99
00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:01,046
to evaluate. 
The interval x goes from 0 to 1 of x to 

100
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:07,731
the eighth of 1 minus x to the eighth. 
Times 25 plus 816 times x squared and all 

101
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:13,276
of that over 3164 times one plus x 
squared. 

102
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:25,133
And the answer that you get here is 
pretty entertaining.
