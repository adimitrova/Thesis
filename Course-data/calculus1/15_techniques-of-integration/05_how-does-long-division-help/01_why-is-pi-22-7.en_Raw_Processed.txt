music going to sneak a 
certain fact 
i want to show that pi is less 
sevenths 
awfully close 
pi is 
seventh is 
alright 
awfully close 
well anunknown 
im going to make something up, 
itll turn in retrospect to 
exactly we need 
so tricks going to be, 
integral to x to fourth 
times one minus x to fourth 
one plus x squared dx 
i integrate that 
well, we actually 
calculation, lets notice something 
integrand 
denominator here is positive 
numerator, well long x 
isnt , numerators positive 
well 
continuous im integrating a 
continuous function thats mostly 
positive except end point 
so that means that this integral ends 
positive well 
well need that fact later 
the, fact that integrals 
positive 
lets work integrand 
im going to focus first 
numerator 
minus x to fourth 
if i multiply this i get x to 
fourth minus x cubed plus x squared 
minus x plus 
if i multiply this x to 
fourth, that adds to 
exponents 
this will x to eighth minus x to 
seventh, plus x to sixth, minus 
x to fifth, plus x to fourth 
lets get ready to long division 
so im going to copy this 
so, i get numerator, 
x to fourth times minus x to 
fourth 
expand out, x to eight minus 
x to seventh plus x to sixth 
minus x to fifth 
plus x to fourth, im going to 
take that numerator i divide 
one plus x squared, so this 
going to long division 
im dividing this by, i write x 
squared plus one 
okay, so thats calculation i want to 

i want to this long division problem 
well i gotta put something here that i 
multiply x squared plus to kill x to 
th 
and, that i could use x to th, 
x to th times x squared is x 
to eighth 
x to sixth times , is plus 
x to th 
im going to subtract that, 
i get 
well, x to th terms cancel, 
ive got a minus x to th 
x to sixth minus x to sixth is 
x to sixth minus x to fifth 
plus x to fourth 
survive im subtracting 
anything soon copy down, minus 
x to fifth plus x to fourth 
alright, you gotta put something 
here that i multiply x squared 
plus to minus x to seventh 
minus x to fifth 
because, that times x squared gives 
minus x to seventh that times 
gives ooh, minus x to fifth 
thats great 
so this term dies this term dies 
lets copy terms actually 
x to sixth 
plus x to fourth 
i put here to multiply 
this to kill this 
plus five x to fourth will it, 
that times x squared gives 
five x to sixth, five x to 
fourth times one gives plus x to 
fourth 
remember, im subtracting this 
so that kills this first term 
here ive got minus x to 
fourth 
im going to write that here 
so, minus x to fourth is thats 
left 
ive gotta put something here to 
multiply this to kill this 
minus x squared, that 
times this gives minus x to 
fourth 
minus x squared 
im subtracting this so this becomes 
x squared 
ive got to put something here to 
multiply this to kill this 
well plus will 
plus times that gives x squared 
plus 
i subtract this i get minus four 
left thats remainder 
we rewrite integral 
so in light expansion 
numerator long division i 
divided plus x squared 
this is integral to 
of, well, i get i divided 
x to sixth minus four x to 
fifth plus five x to fourth minus 
four x squared 
plus four i a remainder so 
minus four one plus x squared 
this is an integral i 
okay this is x to seventh seven 
that is antiderivative x to 
sixth 
antiderivative here is four x to 
sixth six 
plus an antiderivative here 
x to fifth, antiderivative 
here is minus x to third 
antiderivative is plus x, 
an antiderivative plus x 
squared, well antiderivative 
plus x squareds arctan 
so this is minus , orcten x im 
integrating to , so im 
going to evaluate this to 
now, i get i evaluate this 
i plug in , i get , , , , 
arctan is 
so, i end subtracting 
so i to evaluate this 
to figure this integral is equal 
to 
so i plug in , i get seventh 
minus sixths plus one minus thirds 
plus minus times, whats arctan 
, well arctan is pi , lets 
simplify a bit 
so, ive got seventh, ill put 
a common denominator three 
so, minus thirds plus thirds minus 
thirds plus thirds, minus 
times pi is minus pi 
well i 
lets see here 
so ive got minus minus thats minus 
thirds, plus , thats thirds 
minus thirds 
that gives thirds leftover, 
also minus pi 
so ive got a seventh 
plus, well thirds is minus pi 
well seventh plus thats sevenths 
minus pi 
heres significance this, remember 
back to beginning 
well way back beginning i pointed 
that this integral is positive 
so we shown 
so weve shown that this, value 
integral is positive 
in words, that sevenths is 
bigger pi 
so this is really a fun example 
weve got pieces coming 
together 
weve got derivative arctan, long 
division polynomials, fundamental 
theorem calculus 
forces combining to convince us 
that sevenths is bigger pi 
so if you want an entertaining challenge, 
here is an even complicated integral 
to evaluate 
interval x goes to x to 
eighth minus x to eighth 
times plus times x squared 
that times one plus x 
squared 
answer that you get here is 
pretty entertaining
