00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,002
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:09,290
Sometimes it isn't clear that you can do 
integration by parts until after you 

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,296
perform some substitution. 
For example, let's attack this integral, 

4
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:17,789
the integral of e to the square root of 
x, dx. 

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,031
We'll start by making a substitution that 
looks totally unjustified. 

6
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:25,650
But in retrospect, will turn out to be a 
brilliant move. 

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,700
Well, here's the substitution I'm 
proposing. 

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,910
Let's set u equal to the square root of 
x. 

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,512
How does that change the integral? 
So in this case, if u is the square root 

10
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:42,210
of x, then du is 1 over 2 square roots of 
x, dx. 

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,917
in other words, right? 
I could solve this and find that dx is 2u 

12
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,604
du. 
Now, what does that end up doing to the 

13
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:53,826
integral? 
Well, this integral then becomes the 

14
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:58,862
integral of e to the u, and instead of 
dx, it's now 2u du. 

15
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:03,700
now it's a polynomial times an 
exponential function. 

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,972
We can use parts. 
But, if I'm going to use parts, I 

17
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:10,068
probably wanted to call them u and v, 
right? 

18
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:14,560
But, I'll just change the names. 
Instead of talking about u and dv, I'll 

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:23,002
talk about v and dw. 
So, in this problem I'll have v be 2u and 

20
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:32,344
dw will be e to the u, du. 
And now the derivative of v, right? 

21
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:38,050
Gives me that dv is 2 du. 
And an anti-derivative here I can pick 

22
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:44,500
one, I'll have w be e to the u. 
So in that case, what does parts tell me? 

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,822
Well, parts then tells me that this 
integral is the same as 2u, e to the u 

24
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:59,666
minus the integral of w, dv, which is e 
to the u times 2 du. 

25
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,870
But now, this in integration problem that 
I can do. 

26
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,128
I know an anti-derivative of e to the u. 
So, this is 2u, e to the u minus 2e to 

27
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,800
the u. 
I'm going to go back now. 

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,120
And remember that I set u equal to the 
square root of x. 

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,000
So, this gives me 2 square root of x, e 
to the square root of x minus 2e to the 

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,056
square root of x. 
If I notice there's a common factor of 2e 

31
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:32,592
to the square root of x, I could collect 
those terms and write this as 2e to the 

32
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:39,010
square root of x times the square root of 
x minus 1. 

33
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,124
And that's an anti-derivative for e to 
the square root of e. 

34
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:48,344
And if I want to be a little bit more 
careful, maybe I'll include a plus C at 

35
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:51,252
the end. 
We did it. 

36
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:54,780
Contrast that with, say this integration 
problem, the integral of e and the 

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,457
negative of x squared dx. 
This is an integration problem that I 

38
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:01,335
can't solve using the functions that I 
have at hand. 

39
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:04,311
And that this problem looks really 
similar to the original problem here, e 

40
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,780
to the square root of x, right? 
It's e to some power of x. 

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,816
So, you'd think that if we can solve this 
one, we should also be able to solve this 

42
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:18,092
one. 
Seemingly similar problems, right? 

43
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:24,673
Can have totally different outcomes.
