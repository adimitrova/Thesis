sometimes isnt clear that you 
integration parts until you 
perform substitution 
example, lets attack this integral, 
integral e to square root 
x, dx 
well start making a substitution that 
looks totally unjustified 
in retrospect, will turn to a 
brilliant move 
well, heres substitution im 
proposing 
lets set u equal to square root 
x 
that change integral 
so in this case, if u is square root 
x, du is square roots 
x, dx 
in words, right 
i could solve this find that dx is u 
du 
now, that end to 
integral 
well, this integral becomes 
integral e to u, instead 
dx, u du 
a polynomial times an 
exponential function 
we use parts 
but, if im going to use parts, i 
probably wanted to call u v, 
right 
but, ill change names 
instead talking u dv, ill 
talk v dw 
so, in this problem ill v u 
dw will e to u, du 
derivative v, right 
gives that dv is du 
an antiderivative here i pick 
one, ill w e to u 
so in that case, parts tell 
well, parts tells that this 
integral is u, e to u 
minus integral w, dv, is e 
to u times du 
now, this in integration problem that 
i 
i know an antiderivative e to u 
so, this is u, e to u minus e to 
u 
im going to go back 
remember that i set u equal to 
square root x 
so, this gives square root x, e 
to square root x minus e to 
square root x 
if i notice theres a common factor e 
to square root x, i could collect 
terms write this e to 
square root x times square root 
x minus 
thats an antiderivative e to 
square root e 
if i want to a little bit 
careful, maybe ill include a plus c 
end 
we 
contrast that with, say this integration 
problem, integral e 
negative x squared dx 
this is an integration problem that i 
cant solve using functions that i 
hand 
that this problem looks really 
similar to original problem here, e 
to square root x, right 
e to power x 
so, youd think that if we solve this 
one, we also able to solve this 
one 
seemingly similar problems, right 
totally different outcomes
