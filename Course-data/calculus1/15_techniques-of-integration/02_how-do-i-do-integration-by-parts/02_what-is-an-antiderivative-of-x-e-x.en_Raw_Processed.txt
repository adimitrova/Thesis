basic idea integration parts is 
that lets you differentiate part 
integrand, if youre willing 
to pay a price 
that price is antidifferentiating 
part integrand 
well, lets try 
example, lets find an 
antiderivative x times e to x 
if going to attack this integrand 
parts, ive got to pick a u a 
dv 
id willing to differentiate x 
thatll make x go away 
price id to pay is to 
antidifferentiate remains 
antidifferentiating e to x is 
much a price to pay e to 
x is antiderivative 
so lets set that 
lets set u to x, id like to 
differentiate that part 
im willing to antidifferentiate 
remains 
now, lets figure du v 
if u is x, du is dx 
then, ive got to pick an 
antiderivative dv 
now, in principle, theres a ton 
antiderivatives i could pick, right 
e to x plus differentiates e 
to x 
ill pick nice one 
ill pick e to x 
ive got u, dv, v, du 
we put together 
parts tells that an antiderivative u 
dv is uv minus antiderivative v du 
so, in this case, antiderivative 
u dv is u times v, x times e to x 
minus antiderivative v du, is 
dx 
but, i know to integrate e to x 
antiderivative e to x is 

so, antiderivative x, e to x 
is x, e to x minus e to x plus 
constant 
we it, we check answer 
so we to differentiate this make 
sure i get x, e to x 
lets try 
so, if i differentiate xe to x minus 
e to x, i dont need to add plus 
c if i differentiate a constant, 
i get 
right, this is a derivative a 
difference so difference 
derivatives 
this is a derivative a 
product, so im going to use product 
rule 
im going to take derivative 
first, so derivative x, times 
second, plus first times 
derivative a second, right 
thats product rule 
i subtract, well, derivative 
e to x is 
ive got derivative x, 
is times e to x plus x times 
derivative e to x e to x minus 
e to x 
heres slightly exciting part, 
right 
this this cancel, im left 
is x times e to x 
so, in fact, we found an 
antiderivative x e to x 
here is 
course, that makes sense 
integration parts is a product 
rule in reverse 
now, we use trick to attack 
similar integration problems 
example, lets say you want to 
antidifferentiate polynomial in x 
times e to te x 
you could this parts 
well, 
well, ive made this u i make this 
dv 
is that a great choice 
well, think parts lets you 
parts lets you differentiate part 
integrand if youre willing to 
antidifferentiate rest 
antidifferentiating e to x is 
paying price 
antiderivative 
and, if you differentiate polynomial, 
you reduce degree 
so, parts enough times, 
eventually youre 
antidifferentiating e to x 
itself, you definitely
