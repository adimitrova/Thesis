[MUSIC].

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:09,115
The basic idea of integration by parts is 
that it lets you differentiate part of 

3
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:13,615
the integrand, but only if you're willing 
to pay a price. 

4
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:18,726
And that price is anti-differentiating 
the other part of the integrand. 

5
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,960
Well, let's try it. 
For example, let's find an 

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,242
anti-derivative of x times e to the x. 
If we're going to attack this integrand 

7
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:31,578
by parts, then I've got to pick a u and a 
dv. 

8
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:36,640
I'd be willing to differentiate x. 
That'll make x just go away. 

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,116
And the price I'd have to pay is to 
anti-differentiate what remains. 

10
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,782
But anti-differentiating e to the x is 
not much of a price to pay because e to 

11
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:47,440
the x is its own anti-derivative. 
So let's set that down. 

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,710
Let's set u to the x, because I'd like to 
differentiate that part. 

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,870
And I'm willing to anti-differentiate 
what remains. 

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,469
Now, let's figure out du and v. 
Now if u is x, then du is dx. 

15
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,978
And then, I've got to pick an 
anti-derivative for dv. 

16
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:09,500
Now, in principle, there's a ton of 
anti-derivatives I could pick, right? 

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,630
e to the x plus 17 differentiates the e 
to the x. 

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,070
But I'll just pick the nice one. 
I'll pick e to the x. 

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,670
Now I've got u, dv, v, and du. 
We can put it all together. 

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,778
Parts tells me that an anti-derivative u 
dv is uv minus anti-derivative v du. 

21
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:35,354
So, in this case, the anti-derivative of 
u dv is u times v, x times e to the x 

22
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:45,740
minus anti-derivative of v du, which is 
just dx. 

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,505
But, I know how to integrate e to the x. 
Anti-derivative of e to the x is just 

24
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:55,432
itself. 
So, the anti-derivative of x, e to the x 

25
00:01:55,432 --> 00:02:00,210
is x, e to the x minus e to the x plus 
some constant. 

26
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,164
We did it, and we can check our answer. 
So we have to differentiate this and make 

27
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:09,420
sure I get x, e to the x. 
Let's try it. 

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,442
So, if I differentiate xe to the x minus 
e to the x, I don't need to add the plus 

29
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:20,130
C because if I differentiate a constant, 
I just get 0. 

30
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,855
All right, this is a derivative of a 
difference so it's the difference of the 

31
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:28,312
derivatives. 
But now this is a derivative of a 

32
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:31,530
product, so I'm going to use the product 
rule. 

33
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,950
I'm going to take the derivative of the 
first, so the derivative of x, times the 

34
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,350
second, plus the first times the 
derivative of a second, right? 

35
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,500
That's the product rule. 
And then I subtract, well, the derivative 

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,914
of e to the x is just itself. 
And I've got the derivative of x, which 

37
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:53,690
is 1 times e to the x plus x times the 
derivative of e to the x e to the x minus 

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,377
e to the x. 
And here's the slightly exciting part, 

39
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:02,355
right? 
This and this cancel, and all I'm left 

40
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:08,290
with is just x times e to the x. 
So, in fact, we have found an 

41
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,020
anti-derivative for x e to the x. 
Here it is. 

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,725
And of course, that makes sense because 
integration by parts is just a product 

43
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:19,752
rule in reverse. 
Now, we can use the same trick to attack 

44
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:24,616
similar integration problems. 
For example, let's say you want to 

45
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:30,760
anti-differentiate some polynomial in x 
times e to te x. 

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,381
You could do this with parts. 
Well, how? 

47
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:38,010
Well, I've made this be u and I make this 
be dv. 

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,020
And why is that such a great choice? 
Well, think about what parts lets you do. 

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,200
Parts lets you differentiate part of the 
integrand if you're willing to 

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,468
anti-differentiate the rest. 
But anti-differentiating e to the x is 

51
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:53,863
paying no price at all because it's its 
own anti-derivative. 

52
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:58,350
And, if you differentiate the polynomial, 
then you reduce its degree. 

53
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,802
So, by doing parts enough times, 
eventually you're just 

54
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:13,133
anti-differentiating e to the x by 
itself, which you can definitely do.
