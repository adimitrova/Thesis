we
've
already
learned
about
the
chain
rule
in
reverse
.
that
technique
was
u
substitution
.
i
want
to
anti-differentiate
a
function
evaluated
at
g
times
the
derivative
of
g.
i
can
make
a
substitution
and
reduce
that
just
down
to
anti-differenting
f
of
this
new
variable
u.
now
we
're
going
to
run
the
product
rule
in
reverse
.
what
is
the
product
rule
?
well
the
product
rule
tells
us
how
to
differentiate
the
product
of
two
functions
.
so
here
's
two
functions
,
f
and
g
,
and
if
i
want
to
differentiate
their
product
,
using
the
product
rule
,
right
.
the
derivative
of
the
product
is
the
derivative
of
the
first
,
times
the
second
plus
the
first
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
second
.
now
,
integrate
both
sides
.
so
then
i
get
that
anti
derivative
of
the
derivative
of
f
times
g
,
is
anti
derivative
of
,
what
's
this
by
the
product
rule
?
alright
,
it
's
derivative
of
the
first
,
times
the
second
,
plus
the
first
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
second
.
but
the
antiderivative
of
the
derivative
is
just
the
original
function
.
so
let
's
write
that
down
.
that
tells
me
that
an
antiderivative
of
the
derivative
of
f
times
g
plus
f
times
the
derivative
of
g
is
this
.
which
is
just
f
of
x
times
g
of
x
,
and
i
'll
include
a
constant
.
that
's
the
integral
of
a
sum
,
so
its
the
sum
of
the
intergrates
.
so
integrate
f
prime
of
x
g
of
x
dx
plus
integral
of
f
of
x
,
g
prime
of
x
dx
and
we
get
f
of
x
times
g
of
x
plus
a
constant
.
and
that
's
one
very
symmetric
way
of
writing
down
the
product
rule
in
reverse
.
but
we
can
rearrange
it
a
bit
more
.
i
'll
subtract
this
integral
from
both
sides
,
so
the
left
hand
side
is
just
this
integral
.
so
the
integral
of
f
of
x
,
g
prime
of
x
dx
is
equal
to
,
well
heres
what
we
got
on
the
righthand
side
f
of
x
times
g
of
x.
but
i
'm
going
to
subtract
this
.
subtracting
f
prime
of
x
g
of
x
dx
.
now
look
at
what
this
is
saying
.
it
's
saying
that
i
can
do
this
integration
problem
if
i
can
do
this
integration
problem
.
and
how
do
these
two
integration
problems
differ
?
well
here
i
've
got
a
function
times
a
derivative
and
here
i
've
got
the
derivative
of
f
and
an
antiderivative
of
this
.
right
?
g
is
an
antiderivative
of
g
prime
.
so
i
can
replace
this
integration
problem
with
another
integration
problem
.
where
i
've
differentiated
part
of
the
integrand
,
and
anti-differentiated
another
piece
of
the
integrand
.
it
'll
be
a
bit
easier
to
see
what
's
going
on
if
i
make
some
substitutions
.
let
's
set
u
equal
to
f
of
x
,
and
dv
equal
to
g
prime
xdx
.
and
in
that
case
d
u
is
f
prime
x
d
x.
and
what
's
an
anti-derivative
of
this
.
well
one
of
them
is
just
g
of
x.
so
i
can
use
these
substitutions
to
rewrite
what
i
've
got
up
here
.
this
integral
is
u
times
dv
.
and
it
's
equal
to
u
times
v
,
minus
the
integral
of
g
is
v.
and
f
prime
dx
is
du
.
so
now
i
've
got
the
integral
of
udv
is
uv
minus
the
integral
of
vdu
.
this
is
maybe
why
it
makes
sense
to
call
this
integration
by
parts
.
so
i
can
integrate
udv
provided
i
can
integrated
vdu
.
it
's
this
trading
game
.
i
'm
trading
this
integration
problem
for
this
integration
problem
.
but
now
one
part
is
differentiated
and
another
part
of
the
inner
grand
is
antidifferentiated
.
maybe
that
'll
make
things
better
.
with
u
substitution
,
we
had
to
come
up
with
a
single
u.
in
contrast
,
when
you
're
doing
integration
by
parts
,
when
using
this
formula
.
you
not
only
have
to
pick
a
u
,
but
you
've
got
to
pick
a
dv
so
that
you
can
write
your
integrand
as
udv
.
this
makes
parts
a
bit
harder
to
apply
the
u
substitution
.
i
've
got
ta
find
both
a
u
and
a
dv
.
but
any
time
you
're
willing
to
differentiate
part
of
the
integrand
at
the
price
of
antidifferentiating
the
other
part
of
the
integrand
.
well
if
that
's
something
you
're
willing
to
do
,
parts
will
do
that
for
you
.
