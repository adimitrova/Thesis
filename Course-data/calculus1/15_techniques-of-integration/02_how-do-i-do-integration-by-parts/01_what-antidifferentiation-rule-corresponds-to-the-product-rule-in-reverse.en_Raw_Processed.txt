music weve already learned 
chain rule in reverse 
that technique u substitution 
i want to antidifferentiate a function 
evaluated g times derivative g 
i make a substitution reduce that 
to antidifferenting f this 
new variable u 
going to run product rule 
in reverse 
is product rule 
well product rule tells us to 
differentiate product two 
functions 
so heres two functions, f g, if 
i want to differentiate product, 
using product rule, right 
derivative product is 
derivative first, times second 
plus first, times derivative 
second 
now, integrate sides 
so i get that anti derivative 
derivative f times g, is anti 
derivative of, whats this product 
rule 
alright, derivative first, 
times second, plus first, times 
derivative second 
antiderivative derivative 
is original function 
so lets write that 
that tells that an antiderivative 
derivative f times g plus f times 
derivative g is this 
is f x times g x, 
ill include a constant 
thats integral a sum, so 
sum intergrates 
so integrate f prime x g x dx plus 
integral f x, g prime x dx 
we get f x times g x plus a 
constant 
thats one symmetric way 
writing product rule in reverse 
we rearrange a bit 
ill subtract this integral 
sides, so left hand side is this 
integral 
so integral f x, g prime x 
dx is equal to, well heres we got 
righthand side f x times g x 
im going to subtract this 
subtracting f prime x g x dx 
look this is saying 
saying that i this 
integration problem if i this 
integration problem 
two integration problems 
differ 
well here ive got a function times a 
derivative here ive got 
derivative f an antiderivative 
this 
right 
g is an antiderivative g prime 
so i replace this integration problem 
another integration problem 
ive differentiated part 
integrand, antidifferentiated 
another piece integrand 
itll a bit easier to see whats going 
if i make substitutions 
lets set u equal to f x, dv equal 
to g prime xdx 
in that case d u is f prime x d x 
whats an antiderivative this 
well one is g x 
so i use substitutions to 
rewrite ive got here 
this integral is u times dv 
equal to u times v, minus 
integral g is v 
f prime dx is du 
so ive got integral udv is uv 
minus integral vdu 
this is maybe makes sense to call 
this integration parts 
so i integrate udv provided i 
integrated vdu 
this trading game 
im trading this integration problem 
this integration problem 
one part is differentiated 
another part inner grand is 
antidifferentiated 
maybe thatll make things better 
u substitution, we to come 
a single u 
in contrast, youre 
integration parts, using this 
formula 
you to pick a u, youve 
got to pick a dv so that you write 
integrand udv 
this makes parts a bit harder to apply 
u substitution 
ive gotta find a u a dv 
time youre willing to 
differentiate part integrand 
price antidifferentiating 
part integrand 
well if thats something youre willing 
to do, parts will that you
