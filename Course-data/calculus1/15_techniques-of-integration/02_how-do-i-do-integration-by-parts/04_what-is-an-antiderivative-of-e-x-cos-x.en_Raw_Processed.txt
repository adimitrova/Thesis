music integrating requires patience 
sometimes you start attacking 
monster, might take a little bit 
time you start to see success 
prepare to persevere 
lets attack indefinite integral 
cosx times e to x dx 
theres a metaphor here 
theres really different ways to win 
battle 
suppose this is you, this is 
integral that youre trying to attack 
one way, is you know, to try 
hand, right 
to take shield to take 
sword, to evaluate that integral 
directly by, say going back to 
definition riemann sum 
we almost never attack integrals in 
this way 
instead using, you know, swords 
shields, really using, you know, 
magic 
right 
putting wizard hat 
instead trying to kill 
intregral, right 
we use something like u substitution to 
transform that integration problem a 
friendly integration problem that we 
actually deal with, right 
never attacking integrals directly 
transforming integrals 
u substitutions parts 
so lets try to transform integration 
that attacking here 
lets tranform e to x cosx to 
something else 
so ill use u, ill make u e to 
x 
i dont really mind 
differentiating that 
ill make dv cosx dx 
in that case, derivative e to 
x is e to x 
whats an antiderivative cosine 
an antiderivative cosine is sine 
is integration parts say 
so antiderivative cosx e to 
x dx is u times v, so e to x sinx 
minus intergral v du so, sinx, e 
to x dx 
well that didnt really help matters 
word day is persevere 
so lets persevere, transform that 
integral yet another monster 
so monster in this case is this thing 
here 
lets try trick that new 
integral 
so u will e to x dv 
here, will whats left over, sine 
x dx 
in that case, if u is e to x, 
du is e to x dx 
and, if dv is sin x dx, well, ive got 
choices antiderivative, 
ill v minus cosx 
now, ive put this integration 
parts formula 
so antiderivative sinx e to x 
dx is uv, so minus e to x cosx minus 
vdu 
so my, integral vdu, so v is 
cosx, du is e to x dx 
whats happened thus far in 
battle 
im attacking this integral 
i used integration parts to transform 
monster something else 
didnt help, so i used that magical 
weapon 
i used integration parts to 
transform integration problem 
yet another integration problem 
didnt help 

happens if i put two 
integration facts together 
well, ive got here, 
integral cosx, e to x dx, is equal 
to e to x sin x minus integral 
sinx, e to x, dx, is here 
so minus negative e to x cos x plus 
integral cosine x e to dx 
lets persevere, lets keep going 
so this is saying integral cos x e 
to x dx is e to x sin x plus e to 
x, cosine x, minus integral 
cosine x, e to x, dx 
im going to add integral cos 
x e to x, dx to sides 
ill get is times 
integral cos x e to x, dx is equal 
to, well whats left righthand 
side, e to x sin x plus e to x, 
cos x 
ill divide sides , 
if i divide this side this side 
well cancel, i 
find that an antiderivative cosine 
x e to x is e to x sin x plus z 
to x cos x 
we here is one favorite 
applications integration parts 
we didnt use integration parts to 
solve, to evaluate integral directly 
instead, i applied parts twice ended 
a clone original monster 
so that go 
well, here you are, right, youre a 
wizard, so heres wizard hat, 
heres integral that we wanted to 
attack 
we didnt attack this integral 
directly 
we didnt even transform this integral 
using u substitution 
instead, we used parts twice 
seemed like that a terrible idea 
i applied parts twice, i 
ended a clone original 
monster 
integral ended appearing 
but, that integral came a 
minus sign 
and, consequently that monster ends 
defeating able to 
evaluate integral without actually 
integrating 
if anything suggests that theres 
creativity in battles ahead us, i 
think integration parts is telling us, 
to prepared to amazed
