the basic idea of integration by parts is 
that it lets you differentiate part of 
the integrand, but only if you're willing 
to pay a price. 
and that price is anti-differentiating 
the other part of the integrand. 
well, let's try it. 
for example, let's find an 
anti-derivative of x times e to the x. 
if we're going to attack this integrand 
by parts, then i've got to pick a u and a 
dv. 
i'd be willing to differentiate x. 
that'll make x just go away. 
and the price i'd have to pay is to 
anti-differentiate what remains. 
but anti-differentiating e to the x is 
not much of a price to pay because e to 
the x is its own anti-derivative. 
so let's set that down. 
let's set u to the x, because i'd like to 
differentiate that part. 
and i'm willing to anti-differentiate 
what remains. 
now, let's figure out du and v. 
now if u is x, then du is dx. 
and then, i've got to pick an 
anti-derivative for dv. 
now, in principle, there's a ton of 
anti-derivatives i could pick, right? 
e to the x plus 17 differentiates the e 
to the x. 
but i'll just pick the nice one. 
i'll pick e to the x. 
now i've got u, dv, v, and du. 
we can put it all together. 
parts tells me that an anti-derivative u 
dv is uv minus anti-derivative v du. 
so, in this case, the anti-derivative of 
u dv is u times v, x times e to the x 
minus anti-derivative of v du, which is 
just dx. 
but, i know how to integrate e to the x. 
anti-derivative of e to the x is just 
itself. 
so, the anti-derivative of x, e to the x 
is x, e to the x minus e to the x plus 
some constant. 
we did it, and we can check our answer. 
so we have to differentiate this and make 
sure i get x, e to the x. 
let's try it. 
so, if i differentiate xe to the x minus 
e to the x, i don't need to add the plus 
c because if i differentiate a constant, 
i just get 0. 
all right, this is a derivative of a 
difference so it's the difference of the 
derivatives. 
but now this is a derivative of a 
product, so i'm going to use the product 
rule. 
i'm going to take the derivative of the 
first, so the derivative of x, times the 
second, plus the first times the 
derivative of a second, right? 
that's the product rule. 
and then i subtract, well, the derivative 
of e to the x is just itself. 
and i've got the derivative of x, which 
is 1 times e to the x plus x times the 
derivative of e to the x e to the x minus 
e to the x. 
and here's the slightly exciting part, 
right? 
this and this cancel, and all i'm left 
with is just x times e to the x. 
so, in fact, we have found an 
anti-derivative for x e to the x. 
here it is. 
and of course, that makes sense because 
integration by parts is just a product 
rule in reverse. 
now, we can use the same trick to attack 
similar integration problems. 
for example, let's say you want to 
anti-differentiate some polynomial in x 
times e to te x. 
you could do this with parts. 
well, how? 
well, i've made this be u and i make this 
be dv. 
and why is that such a great choice? 
well, think about what parts lets you do. 
parts lets you differentiate part of the 
integrand if you're willing to 
anti-differentiate the rest. 
but anti-differentiating e to the x is 
paying no price at all because it's its 
own anti-derivative. 
and, if you differentiate the polynomial, 
then you reduce its degree. 
so, by doing parts enough times, 
eventually you're just 
anti-differentiating e to the x by 
itself, which you can definitely do.
