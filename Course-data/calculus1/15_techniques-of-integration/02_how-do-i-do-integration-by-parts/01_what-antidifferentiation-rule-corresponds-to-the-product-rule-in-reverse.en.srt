00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,100
[MUSIC] We've already learned about the 
chain rule in reverse. 

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,206
That technique was u substitution. 
I want to anti-differentiate a function 

3
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:20,262
evaluated at g times the derivative of g. 
I can make a substitution and reduce that 

4
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:24,700
just down to anti-differenting f of this 
new variable u. 

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,980
Now we're going to run the product rule 
in reverse. 

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,260
What is the product rule? 
Well the product rule tells us how to 

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,020
differentiate the product of two 
functions. 

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,732
So here's two functions, f and g, and if 
I want to differentiate their product, 

9
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:43,470
using the product rule, right. 
The derivative of the product is the 

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,298
derivative of the first, times the second 
plus the first, times the derivative of 

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:53,910
the second. 
Now, integrate both sides. 

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,282
So then I get that anti derivative of the 
derivative of f times g, is anti 

13
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:07,102
derivative of, what's this by the product 
rule? 

14
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:12,250
Alright, it's derivative of the first, 
times the second, plus the first, times 

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,250
the derivative of the second. 
But the antiderivative of the derivative 

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,630
is just the original function. 
So let's write that down. 

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,610
That tells me that an antiderivative of 
the derivative of f times g plus f times 

18
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:34,332
the derivative of g is this. 
Which is just f of x times g of x, and 

19
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:39,958
I'll include a constant. 
That's the integral of a sum, so its the 

20
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:45,352
sum of the intergrates. 
So integrate f prime of x g of x dx plus 

21
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:50,604
integral of f of x, g prime of x dx and 
we get f of x times g of x plus a 

22
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:57,977
constant. 
And that's one very symmetric way of 

23
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:04,760
writing down the product rule in reverse. 
But we can rearrange it a bit more. 

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll subtract this integral from both 
sides, so the left hand side is just this 

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,289
integral. 
So the integral of f of x, g prime of x 

26
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:19,854
dx is equal to, well heres what we got on 
the righthand side f of x times g of x. 

27
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:29,220
But I'm going to subtract this. 
Subtracting f prime of x g of x dx. 

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,031
Now look at what this is saying. 
It's saying that I can do this 

29
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:37,390
integration problem if I can do this 
integration problem. 

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,160
And how do these two integration problems 
differ? 

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,150
Well here I've got a function times a 
derivative and here I've got the 

32
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,418
derivative of f and an antiderivative of 
this. 

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,200
Right? 
g is an antiderivative of g prime. 

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,909
So I can replace this integration problem 
with another integration problem. 

35
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,877
Where I've differentiated part of the 
integrand, and anti-differentiated 

36
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:04,473
another piece of the integrand. 
It'll be a bit easier to see what's going 

37
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:11,861
on if I make some substitutions. 
Let's set u equal to f of x, and dv equal 

38
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:21,080
to g prime xdx. 
And in that case d u is f prime x d x. 

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,520
And what's an anti-derivative of this. 
Well one of them is just g of x. 

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,232
So I can use these substitutions to 
rewrite what I've got up here. 

41
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:41,880
This integral is u times dv. 
And it's equal to u times v, minus the 

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:50,900
integral of g is v. 
And f prime dx is du. 

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,760
So now I've got the integral of udv is uv 
minus the integral of vdu. 

44
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,370
This is maybe why it makes sense to call 
this Integration by parts. 

45
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,870
So I can integrate udv provided I can 
integrated vdu. 

46
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,300
It's this trading game. 
I'm trading this integration problem for 

47
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,399
this integration problem. 
But now one part is differentiated and 

48
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,820
another part of the inner grand is 
antidifferentiated. 

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,768
Maybe that'll make things better. 
With u substitution, we had to come up 

50
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:28,082
with a single u. 
In contrast, when you're doing 

51
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:31,277
integration by parts, when using this 
formula. 

52
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:35,059
You not only have to pick a u, but you've 
got to pick a dv so that you can write 

53
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:39,673
your integrand as udv. 
This makes parts a bit harder to apply 

54
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:44,520
the u substitution. 
I've gotta find both a u and a dv. 

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,058
But any time you're willing to 
differentiate part of the integrand at 

56
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:52,850
the price of antidifferentiating the 
other part of the integrand. 

57
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,428
Well if that's something you're willing 
to do, parts will do that for you. 

58
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:04,580
