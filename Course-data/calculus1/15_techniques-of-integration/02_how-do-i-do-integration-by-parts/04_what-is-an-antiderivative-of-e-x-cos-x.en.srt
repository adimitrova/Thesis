00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,870
[MUSIC] Integrating requires patience. 
Sometimes you can start attacking the 

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,100
monster, but it might take a little bit 
of time before you start to see success. 

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,063
Prepare to persevere. 
Let's attack the indefinite integral of 

4
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:24,960
cosx times e to the x dx. 
There's a metaphor here. 

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,200
There's really different ways to win the 
battle. 

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,440
Suppose this is you, and this is the 
integral that you're trying to attack. 

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,330
One way, is you know, to try and do it by 
hand, right. 

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,466
To take your shield and to take your 
sword, and just to evaluate that integral 

9
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:45,110
directly by, say going back to the 
definition of Riemann sum. 

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,560
But we almost never attack integrals in 
this way. 

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,420
Instead of using, you know, swords and 
shields, we're really using, you know, 

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,650
magic. 
Right? 

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,683
We're putting on our wizard hat. 
And instead of trying to kill the 

14
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:59,252
intregral, right? 
We use something like u substitution to 

15
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:03,867
transform that integration problem into a 
friendly integration problem that we can 

16
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:08,784
actually deal with, right? 
We're never attacking integrals directly 

17
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:12,780
we're just transforming integrals by 
doing u substitutions or parts. 

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,070
So let's try to transform the integration 
that we're attacking here. 

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,880
Let's tranform e to the x cosx to 
something else. 

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,895
So I'll use what u, I'll make u be e to 
the x. 

21
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,480
because I don't really mind 
differentiating that. 

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,366
And I'll make dv cosx dx. 
Now in that case, the derivative of e to 

23
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:39,201
the x is just e to the x. 
And what's an anti-derivative of cosine? 

24
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:50,110
An anti-derivative of cosine is sine. 
Now what is integration by parts say. 

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:58,370
So then anti-derivative of cosx e to the 
x dx is U times V, so e to the x sinx 

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:08,530
minus the intergral of V du So, sinx, e 
to the x dx. 

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,980
Well that didn't really help matters. 
But the word of the day is persevere. 

28
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,556
So let's persevere, and transform that 
integral into yet another monster. 

29
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,030
So the monster in this case is this thing 
here. 

30
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,750
let's try the same trick on that new 
integral. 

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,491
So U will be e to the x again and dv 
here, will be just what's left over, sine 

32
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:37,487
x dx. 
And in that case, if U is e to the x, 

33
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:43,550
then du is e to the x dx. 
And, if dv is sin x dx, well, I've got 

34
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,648
other choices for more anti-derivative, 
but I'll have v be minus cosx. 

35
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:52,830
Now, I've put this into the integration 
by parts formula. 

36
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:03,125
So the antiderivative of sinx e to the x 
dx is uv, so minus e to the x cosx minus 

37
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:12,175
vdu. 
So my-, the integral of vdu, so v is 

38
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:21,635
cosx, and du is e to the x dx. 
Now what's happened thus far in the 

39
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,150
battle? 
I'm attacking this integral. 

40
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,740
I used integration by parts to transform 
the monster into something else. 

41
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,490
It didn't help, so I used that magical 
weapon again. 

42
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,626
I used integration by parts again to 
transform the integration problem into 

43
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:37,749
yet another integration problem and it 
didn't help. 

44
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,650
Or did it? 
What happens if I put these two 

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,434
integration facts together? 
Well, and then I've got here, the 

46
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:51,852
integral of cosx, e to the x dx, is equal 
to e to the x sin x minus the integral of 

47
00:03:51,852 --> 00:04:01,810
sinx, e to the x, dx, which is down here. 
So minus negative e to x cos x plus the 

48
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:10,070
integral of cosine x e to the dx. 
Lets persevere, lets keep going. 

49
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:16,490
So this is saying the integral of cos x e 
to the x dx is e to the x sin x plus e to 

50
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:25,994
the x, cosine x, minus the integral of 
cosine x, e to the x, dx. 

51
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:32,809
Now I'm going to add the integral of cos 
x e to the x, dx to both sides. 

52
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:38,569
And what I'll then get is 2 times the 
integral of cos x e to the x, dx is equal 

53
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:44,233
to, well what's left on the righthand 
side, e to the x sin x plus e to the x, 

54
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:50,983
cos x. 
And then I'll divide both sides by 2, and 

55
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:55,527
if I divide this side by 2 and this side 
by 2 well then these 2's cancel, and I 

56
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:59,858
find out that an antiderivative of cosine 
x e to the x Is e to the x sin x plus z 

57
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:07,150
to the x cos x all over 2. 
What we did here is one of my favorite 

58
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,599
applications of integration by parts. 
We didn't use integration by parts to 

59
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:16,838
solve, to evaluate the integral directly. 
Instead, I applied parts twice and ended 

60
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:21,660
up with a clone of the original monster. 
So how did that go? 

61
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,116
Well, here you are, right, and you're a 
wizard, so here's your wizard hat, and 

62
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,419
here's the integral that we wanted to 
attack. 

63
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,322
But we didn't attack this integral 
directly. 

64
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,682
We didn't' even transform this integral 
by using U substitution. 

65
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,750
Instead, we used parts twice and it 
seemed like that was a terrible idea 

66
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,922
because when I applied parts twice, I 
ended up with a clone of the original 

67
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,552
monster. 
The same integral ended up appearing. 

68
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,992
But, that other integral came with a 
minus sign. 

69
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:50,712
And, consequently that monster ends up 
defeating itself and we're able to 

70
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:55,030
evaluate the integral without actually 
integrating at all. 

71
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:02,408
If anything suggests that there's 
creativity in the battles ahead of us, I 

72
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:12,333
think integration by parts is telling us, 
to be prepared to be amazed.
