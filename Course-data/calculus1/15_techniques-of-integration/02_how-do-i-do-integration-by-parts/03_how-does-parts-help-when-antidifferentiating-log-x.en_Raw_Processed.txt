music we could figure anti 
derivative log x, guessing 
checking answer 
we also get that anti derivative 
using integration parts 
so i want to know an anti derivative , 
log x dx 
to remind you, this is natural 
log 
first, looks like theres nothing 
helpful here 
would u dv 
trick is to sit u log x thats 
part anagram im going to 
differentiate dv 
to dx gets quite surprising, 
that helps 
lets see, so if u is log x du is 
x dx 
if dv is dx an antiderivative, 
x 
now, parts tell us 
so parts integral u dv, so log 
x dx, thats im interested in 
is u v so x log x minus integral 
vdu, is x times du 
ive got x log x minus x times 
x, thats 
so im antidifferentiating dx 
ive got x log x, whats an 
antiderviative , x, ill 
add a constant 
so im claiming that antiderivative 
log x is x log x minus x plus 
constant 
i think really surprising that, 
least in this case, dv equals dx is a 
great choice 
well heres a similar integration problem 
that you try kind 
technique 
example, heres a challenge 
you find an anti derivative log 
x squared
