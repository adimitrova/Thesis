music youre integrating powers 
sines cosines 
ive got a motto you to remember 
you trade sines cosines vice 
versa 
so 
well since sin squared plus cosin squared 
is , that is pythagorean identity, i 
use this to get two facts 
that i replace sin squared x 
minus cosin squared, i replace a 
cosin squared minus sin squared 
this is often useful 
lets try making trades 
example, lets try to 
antidifferentiate say, sine cubed x 
times cosine squared x, dx 
first inclination might to try 
make a substitution 
rats, i mean if you sin x right 
du would cosine x dx 
i got a cosine squared term there 
that i to deal 
if i made different subsitiution like, 
you know u equals cosine x du, 
would minus sine x dx 
ive got a sine cube term to 
deal 
so instead, ill trade a pair sines 
a pair cosines 
so, instead making a substitution 
immediately 
im going to trade a pair sines a 
pair cosines 
i mean, is that im going to rewrite 
integrand sine x times sine 
squared x times cosine squared x 
im going to use fact that 
sine squared is is 
well minus cosine squared x 
right, so i rewrite integral 
this 
i make substitution u equals 
cosine x 
so, u is cosine x in that case du is 
minus sine x dx i dont quite see 
here 
i manufacture that including a 
minus sign there 
so this becomes integral minus u 
squared times u squared minus 
du 
i expand 
so this is negative integral u 
squared minus u to th du 
ill integrate 
so this is minus i derivative u 
squared is u cubed 
an anti derivative u to th is u 
to th plus c 
ill substitute cosine x, u 
and, we get negative cosine cubed, x 
, plus negative 
subtraction cosine to th x 
plus c 
this kind trick works in 
cases 
example, if i wanted to 
antidifferentiate sine to th power 
times cosine to th power 
since ive got an odd number cosines, 
i trade one 
sines 
i mean is i rewrite this 
integral sine to th times cosine 
squared squared times cosine x dx 
right, this is four cosines times another 
cosine gives cosine to th 
but, now, i use fact that cosine 
squared is minus sine squared 
so i rewrite cosine squared squared, 
minus sine squared, squared 
times cosine dx 
we finish making a 
substitution 
ill make substitution, u equals sine 
x 
in that case, du is cosine x dx 
so, integral becomes, instead sine 
to th, u to th 
minus sine squared is minus u 
squared 
thats squared 
cosine x dx is du 
is that going to work 
yeah, i could definitely finish this off, 
i expand this i get a 
polynomial u 
i antidifferentiate a polynomial 
u replace u sine x to 
get antiderivative sine 
th cosine th 
so whats general pattern to this 
kind trick 
trick works long weve got an 
odd power sine, an odd power 
cosine 
cuz in that case, i split 
one 
ill get say, sine times an even 
power sine, times number 
cosines 
sine, times an even number cosines, 
times cosine 
since this an even number here, i 
rewrite in terms 
so ill end a single sine 
times a bunch cosines, really a 
polynomial cosine x 
a polynomial sine x times cosine, 
i finish a 
single substitution
