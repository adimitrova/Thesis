1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,743
[MUSIC] When you're integrating powers of 
sines and cosines. 

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:13,886
I've got a motto for you to remember. 
You can trade sines for cosines or vice 

3
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:16,510
versa. 
How so? 

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,409
Well since sin squared plus cosin squared 
is 1, that is the Pythagorean identity, I 

5
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:27,053
can use this to get these two facts. 
That I can replace sin squared x by 1 

6
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:33,510
minus cosin squared, and can I replace a 
cosin squared by 1 minus sin squared? 

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,960
This is often useful. 
Let's try making some trades. 

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,450
For example, let's try to 
anti-differentiate say, sine cubed of x 

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,278
times cosine squared of x, dx. 
Our first inclination might be to try and 

10
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:55,332
make a substitution. 
But rats, I mean if you were sin x right 

11
00:00:55,332 --> 00:01:01,687
then du would be cosine x dx. 
But I got a cosine squared term there 

12
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:08,162
that I have to deal with. 
If I made different subsitiution like, 

13
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:15,530
you know u equals cosine x or when du, 
would be minus sine x dx. 

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,220
But then I've got a sine cube term to 
deal with. 

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,772
So instead, I'll trade a pair of sines 
for a pair of cosines. 

16
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,886
So, instead of making a substitution 
immediately. 

17
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,827
I'm going to trade a pair of sines for a 
pair of cosines. 

18
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:35,402
What I mean, is that I'm going to rewrite 
the integrand as sine of x times sine 

19
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:42,363
squared of x times cosine squared of x. 
And then I'm going to use the fact that 

20
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:49,433
sine squared is is what? 
Well it's 1 minus cosine squared x. 

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,230
All right, so I can rewrite the integral 
as this. 

22
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,806
Now I can make the substitution u equals 
cosine x. 

23
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:08,041
So, u is cosine x and in that case du is 
minus sine x dx which I don't quite see 

24
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:16,271
here. 
But I can manufacture that by including a 

25
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:25,329
minus sign there. 
So this becomes the integral of 1 minus u 

26
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:34,720
squared times u squared and then minus 
du. 

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,710
Now I expand. 
So this is negative the integral of u 

28
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,961
squared minus u to the 4th du. 
Now I'll integrate. 

29
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:51,668
So this is minus and I derivative of u 
squared is u cubed over 3. 

30
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:59,730
And an anti derivative u to the 4th is u 
to the 5th over 5 plus c. 

31
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:08,402
Now I'll substitute cosine x, for u. 
And, we get negative cosine cubed, of x 

32
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:16,154
over 3, plus the negative of the 
subtraction Cosine to the 5th x over 5 

33
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:22,235
plus c. 
And this same kind of trick works in 

34
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,982
other cases too. 
For example, what if I wanted to 

35
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:32,420
anti-differentiate sine to the 5th power 
times cosine to the 5th power? 

36
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,680
Since I've got an odd number of cosines, 
I can trade all but one of them for 

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,644
sines. 
What I mean is I can rewrite this 

38
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:50,788
integral as sine to the 5th times cosine 
squared squared times cosine x dx. 

39
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:57,002
Right, this is four cosines times another 
cosine gives me cosine to the 5th. 

40
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:04,661
But, now, I can use the fact that cosine 
squared is 1 minus sine squared. 

41
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:11,829
So I can rewrite cosine squared squared, 
as 1 minus sine squared, squared. 

42
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,300
And then times cosine dx. 
And now we can finish by making a 

43
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,320
substitution. 
I'll make the substitution, u equals sine 

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,826
x. 
In that case, du is cosine x dx. 

45
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:31,820
So, the integral becomes, instead of sine 
to the 5th, u to the 5th. 

46
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,190
1 minus sine squared is 1 minus u 
squared. 

47
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,769
And that's squared. 
And cosine x dx is du. 

48
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,546
Is that going to work? 
Yeah, I could definitely finish this off, 

49
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:48,104
I just expand this out and I get a 
polynomial u. 

50
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:52,392
And I can anti-differentiate a polynomial 
u and then just replace u by sine of x to 

51
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:57,950
get the anti-derivative of sine of the 
5th cosine of the 5th. 

52
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,210
So what's the general pattern to this 
kind of trick? 

53
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,360
The trick works as long as we've got an 
odd power on the sine, or an odd power on 

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,290
the cosine. 
'Cuz in that case, I can split off all 

55
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,748
but one of them. 
And then I'll get say, sine times an even 

56
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:16,810
power of sine, times some number of 
cosines. 

57
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,690
Or sine, times an even number of cosines, 
times cosine. 

58
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:30,099
And since this an even number here, I can 
rewrite those in terms of the other. 

59
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:36,247
So then I'll end up with a single sine 
times a bunch of cosines, really a 

60
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:43,821
polynomial and cosine x. 
Or a polynomial and sine x times cosine, 

61
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:50,304
and then I can finish it off with a 
single substitution.
