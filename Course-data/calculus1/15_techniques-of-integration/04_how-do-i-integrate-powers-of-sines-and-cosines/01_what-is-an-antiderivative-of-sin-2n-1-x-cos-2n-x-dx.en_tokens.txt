when
you
're
integrating
powers
of
sines
and
cosines
.
i
've
got
a
motto
for
you
to
remember
.
you
can
trade
sines
for
cosines
or
vice
versa
.
how
so
?
well
since
sin
squared
plus
cosin
squared
is
1
,
that
is
the
pythagorean
identity
,
i
can
use
this
to
get
these
two
facts
.
that
i
can
replace
sin
squared
x
by
1
minus
cosin
squared
,
and
can
i
replace
a
cosin
squared
by
1
minus
sin
squared
?
this
is
often
useful
.
let
's
try
making
some
trades
.
for
example
,
let
's
try
to
anti-differentiate
say
,
sine
cubed
of
x
times
cosine
squared
of
x
,
dx
.
our
first
inclination
might
be
to
try
and
make
a
substitution
.
but
rats
,
i
mean
if
you
were
sin
x
right
then
du
would
be
cosine
x
dx
.
but
i
got
a
cosine
squared
term
there
that
i
have
to
deal
with
.
if
i
made
different
subsitiution
like
,
you
know
u
equals
cosine
x
or
when
du
,
would
be
minus
sine
x
dx
.
but
then
i
've
got
a
sine
cube
term
to
deal
with
.
so
instead
,
i
'll
trade
a
pair
of
sines
for
a
pair
of
cosines
.
so
,
instead
of
making
a
substitution
immediately
.
i
'm
going
to
trade
a
pair
of
sines
for
a
pair
of
cosines
.
what
i
mean
,
is
that
i
'm
going
to
rewrite
the
integrand
as
sine
of
x
times
sine
squared
of
x
times
cosine
squared
of
x.
and
then
i
'm
going
to
use
the
fact
that
sine
squared
is
is
what
?
well
it
's
1
minus
cosine
squared
x.
all
right
,
so
i
can
rewrite
the
integral
as
this
.
now
i
can
make
the
substitution
u
equals
cosine
x.
so
,
u
is
cosine
x
and
in
that
case
du
is
minus
sine
x
dx
which
i
do
n't
quite
see
here
.
but
i
can
manufacture
that
by
including
a
minus
sign
there
.
so
this
becomes
the
integral
of
1
minus
u
squared
times
u
squared
and
then
minus
du
.
now
i
expand
.
so
this
is
negative
the
integral
of
u
squared
minus
u
to
the
4th
du
.
now
i
'll
integrate
.
so
this
is
minus
and
i
derivative
of
u
squared
is
u
cubed
over
3.
and
an
anti
derivative
u
to
the
4th
is
u
to
the
5th
over
5
plus
c.
now
i
'll
substitute
cosine
x
,
for
u.
and
,
we
get
negative
cosine
cubed
,
of
x
over
3
,
plus
the
negative
of
the
subtraction
cosine
to
the
5th
x
over
5
plus
c.
and
this
same
kind
of
trick
works
in
other
cases
too
.
for
example
,
what
if
i
wanted
to
anti-differentiate
sine
to
the
5th
power
times
cosine
to
the
5th
power
?
since
i
've
got
an
odd
number
of
cosines
,
i
can
trade
all
but
one
of
them
for
sines
.
what
i
mean
is
i
can
rewrite
this
integral
as
sine
to
the
5th
times
cosine
squared
squared
times
cosine
x
dx
.
right
,
this
is
four
cosines
times
another
cosine
gives
me
cosine
to
the
5th
.
but
,
now
,
i
can
use
the
fact
that
cosine
squared
is
1
minus
sine
squared
.
so
i
can
rewrite
cosine
squared
squared
,
as
1
minus
sine
squared
,
squared
.
and
then
times
cosine
dx
.
and
now
we
can
finish
by
making
a
substitution
.
i
'll
make
the
substitution
,
u
equals
sine
x.
in
that
case
,
du
is
cosine
x
dx
.
so
,
the
integral
becomes
,
instead
of
sine
to
the
5th
,
u
to
the
5th
.
1
minus
sine
squared
is
1
minus
u
squared
.
and
that
's
squared
.
and
cosine
x
dx
is
du
.
is
that
going
to
work
?
yeah
,
i
could
definitely
finish
this
off
,
i
just
expand
this
out
and
i
get
a
polynomial
u.
and
i
can
anti-differentiate
a
polynomial
u
and
then
just
replace
u
by
sine
of
x
to
get
the
anti-derivative
of
sine
of
the
5th
cosine
of
the
5th
.
so
what
's
the
general
pattern
to
this
kind
of
trick
?
the
trick
works
as
long
as
we
've
got
an
odd
power
on
the
sine
,
or
an
odd
power
on
the
cosine
.
'cuz
in
that
case
,
i
can
split
off
all
but
one
of
them
.
and
then
i
'll
get
say
,
sine
times
an
even
power
of
sine
,
times
some
number
of
cosines
.
or
sine
,
times
an
even
number
of
cosines
,
times
cosine
.
and
since
this
an
even
number
here
,
i
can
rewrite
those
in
terms
of
the
other
.
so
then
i
'll
end
up
with
a
single
sine
times
a
bunch
of
cosines
,
really
a
polynomial
and
cosine
x.
or
a
polynomial
and
sine
x
times
cosine
,
and
then
i
can
finish
it
off
with
a
single
substitution
.
