weve already seen difficult is to 
integrate powers sin 
example, whats inner goal 
to power a sin nd power 
well turns that its, is 
this, divided 
times pi 
would i ever that 
that looks so random yet theres 
going here 
in fact, this ends times 
times times times times times 
times to nd power 

numbers suggest somethings 
going here that could hardly an 
accident 
goal computing, goal 
numbers, goal everything that 
in this course isnt 
answers 
insight 
so we gain insight 
that integral works like that 
specifically question is 
factor, so nicely 
right i mean theres reason least 
this point to work so 
nicely so factor so nicely 
well to gain insight this lets 
use parts to examine relationship 
between integral sin to nth 
power sin to n minus second 
power 
well, let write that 
to answer this question, 
factors is i want to is figure 
sort relationship 
between interval to pi 
sin to nth power interval 
to pi to n minus second 
power 
well use parts 
so lets start this i gotta pick 
a u a dv 
so ill a u a sin to n minus 
dv, would rest 
this, will sine x dx, so udv 
gives this integrand 
if thats u thats dv, i gotta 
figure d, u, v supposed 
to 
well, if dv is sin x, an 
antiderivative that is minus cosine x 
and, if u is sin to n minus , 
du, weve gotta differentiate this, 
thatll chain rule 
n minus times sin to n minus 
times derivative this 
whats derivative inside 
derivative sin is cosine, 
dx 
we get a formular parts 
so this integral is u v 
so sin, to n minus , times cosine 
a minus sin, evaluated pi 

minus interval to pi 
v du, is well heres n minus sin 
to n minus cosine squared dx 
ive got a minus sin there v so 
ill make that plus 
alright, i plug in pi 
that kills cosine terms, i 
plug in , that kills the, sin term 
so this thing here is , that 
means this original integral is 
integral to pi n minus 
times sin to n minus x 
instead of, cosine square, there ill 
right that minus sin squared x d x 
i expand this 
this is, really difference between 
two integrals i expand 
n minus times integral 
to pi sin to n minus x, 
minus n minus times integral 
to pi sin to n minus 
times sine squared 
is sin to nth power dx 
we solve this 
so, this is ive got this point 
ive that integral to pi 
sin to n x dx is equal to this, 
i parts 
now, i add n minus times 
interval to pi sin to 
nx dx to sides 
i get, well ill get n times 
integral to pi sin to 
n x dx is equal to 
side ill n minus 
integral to pi sin to 
n minus xdx 
i divide sides n 
if i divide sides n, alright, 
i find that integral to pi 
sin to n xdx is n minus 
n times integral to pi 
sin to n minus xdx 
so this formula is telling to 
compute integral sine to nth 
power in terms integral sin to 
n minus second power 
so i get started knowing that 
integral to to pi sin to 
power x dx 
thats integral to 
pi 
well thats pi 
so, whats integral sine squared 
interval to pi 
well, using this formula, n equals 
, i find that integral to pi 
sin squared x dx 
this is n equals , is minus 
, thats n minus n times 
integral to pi sin to 
zeroth power 
i know sin to zeroth power 
is, pi 
so this is half minus times 
this is pi pi 
so integral to power 
sin squared x is pi 
whats integral sine to 
fourth 
well, lets use this formula n 
equals so integral to pi 
signed to fourth x dx 
thatll minus times 
integral to pi sin 
squared xdx, we figured 
integral sin squared is right 
this is th times pi 
whats integral sin to th 
so, that means i look this 
formula n equals 
so, integral to pi 
sin to th x dx is, well if i put in 
n equals , i get minus times 
integral to pi sin 
to th x dx, i figured that 
one 
so, this is th times, well heres 
integral sin to th, times th 
times pi 
whats integral sin to th 
well, that means i use this 
formula n equals 
so, integral to pi 
sin to th dx is, according to this 
n equals , thats minus 
times integral to pi 
sin to th x dx 
we figured sin to th 
this is minus 
thats times integral sin 
to th 
is th times ths times pi 
okay, okay, seeing a pattern 
whats integral sin to nd 
power 
so, integral to pi 
sin to nd power 
following this pattern will 
times times 
, im going to keep going until 
i get to times 
finally times pi 
we cancel like crazy 
so this this give a 
this this give a 
this give a 
gives a 
gives a 
gives a 
gives a 
survives, right 
lets see else i cancel 
is going to survive 
, however, well is going to 
killed a somewhere 
i find a in in , so this 
gives a this gives a 
leftover i kill that somehow 
yeah, that killed this 
giving left 
so this is entirely gone 
is going to survive 

i 
well, weve got a in this , that 
gives a , ive got a here 
will end surviving 
ive got a here 
i here 
well ive got a in this 
i make this this an , if i 
convert this a 
is going to survive is 
is going to survive 
so in numerator, i 
well, numerator, ive got a , a 
a , a , a , a , a , way 
here, a pi 
in denominator ive got a whole 
bunch s, right 
many i 
well ive got to power 
ive got five there, another here, 
two s, a , three s, 
another , two s, another , four 
s, one , two s, one 
, three s, one two, 
here, another four 
thats going to figure 
number that i get i add 
things plus plus plus 
plus plus plus plus plus plus 
plus plus plus plus plus 
thats twos in denominator 
this a triumph 
im making a note here huge success
