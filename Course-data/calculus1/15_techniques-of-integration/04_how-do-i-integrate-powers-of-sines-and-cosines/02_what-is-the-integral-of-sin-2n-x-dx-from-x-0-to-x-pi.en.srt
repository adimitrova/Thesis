1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,954
We already know how to handle some 
integration problems where the integrand 

2
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:15,918
is a powers of sines and cosines. 
For example, I can anti-differentiate 

3
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:19,520
sine to and odd power. 
How? 

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,800
By trading in all but one of those sins 
for cosines. 

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,572
Let's make this really concrete. 
Instead of talking about an odd power 

6
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:30,558
well let's just make it 17. 
Can I antidifferentiate sin to the 17th 

7
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:34,042
power? 
Yeah, I can rewrite this problem as sin 

8
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:38,659
of x times sin squared x to the 8th 
power, because sin square to the 8th 

9
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,600
power gives me 16 copies of sin times 
more sin gives me 17 copies of sin, now 

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,622
we can trade sin squared for some cos 
signs right, sin squared is 1 minus cos 

11
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:58,489
sign squared to the 8th power. 
So if I can do this anti-differentiation 

12
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,380
problem all I need to do is do this 
anti-differentiation problem. 

13
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:11,426
And I can do that with a substitution. 
So make the substitution u equals cosine 

14
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:17,320
x and in that case d u is minus sign x 
dx. 

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,344
Now maybe you're complaining you don't 
see a minus sign. 

16
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:23,524
And you'll only see sin, but I'll just 
put a pair of cancelling minus sins 

17
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:26,651
there, and I see a minus sin next dx so 
we got a du and the rest I can write in 

18
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:31,776
terms of u. 
Specifically, this becomes negative, the 

19
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:36,054
n is derivative of 1 minus u squared to 
the 8 power du, is what's left over and 

20
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,608
this anti-differentiation problem that I 
can do and it is a little bit annoying 

21
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,093
cause I guess I gotta expand this thing 
out to find an anti-derivative of this, 

22
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:53,075
but I can do it. 
But what if instead I'd had an even power 

23
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:57,482
of sine. 
Well, maybe I'll anti-differentiate sine 

24
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,900
to the fouth power. 
All right? 

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,930
So this is not an odd power but an even 
power. 

26
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,214
that's harder, I can't trade in all of my 
sins for cosines because I need just one 

27
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:13,190
left over to make the substitution work. 
Instead, I'll use an identity, the half 

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,165
angle formula. 
It let's me replace sined squared of x by 

29
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:22,978
1 minus cosine of 2x over 2. 
And it lets me replace cosign squared of 

30
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:28,510
x by 1 plus cosign 2x over 2. 
How do those help? 

31
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:35,481
Well I can rewrite this integral as the 
integral of sin squared, squared. 

32
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,260
And now I can use this half angle 
identity. 

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,770
This is the same as the integral of what 
sin squared. 

34
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,100
Sin squared is 1 minus cos 2x over 2. 
All right? 

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,686
These are equal. 
And still have to square that, dx. 

36
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:55,686
Now, I expand. 
So, I get this is the same as 

37
00:02:55,686 --> 00:03:01,572
integrating. 
Well, the cos 2x over 2 term, squared is 

38
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:08,370
cosigned squared of 2x over 4. 
And there's our cross term. 

39
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,640
The 1 half times minus cosign 2 x over 2. 
And there's 2 of those. 

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,060
So I end up getting minus 1 half. 
cosigned 2x. 

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,911
And there's the one half term squared 
just plus a quarter, so I just have to do 

42
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:30,990
this integration problem. 
I can split that into 3 integrals. 

43
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:38,293
So this gives me the integral of cos sign 
squared 2x over 4dx minus the integral of 

44
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:45,760
cos sign 2x over 2dx plus the integral of 
1 4th dx. 

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,286
Now, the second and third integration 
problem I can do, I'm just going to copy 

46
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:56,502
down this one again. 
The integral of cos squared 2x over 4 dx. 

47
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,500
This, here, well I could do this by 
making a substitution. 

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,484
u equals 2x, say. 
And then I'll get that this is sine of 2x 

49
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:12,972
divided by 4. 
And if I integrate a quarter, I get 1 4th 

50
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,180
x. 
What about that first one? 

51
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,946
How do I integrate cosine squared? 
So, to handle this, I can repeat the 

52
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:25,945
trick with the half angle identity. 
But I'm looking at integrating cosign 

53
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:30,073
squared 2x. 
So I'll replace x by 2x and I'll turn 

54
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:34,520
this into a 4x. 
So I can use this identity. 

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,770
How does that go? 
Well I get instead of this the integral 

56
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,350
of 1 plus cosine 4x and instead of over 4 
its now over 8 and then I'll just copy 

57
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:54,310
down these things again. 
Sin 2x over 4 plus a quarter x. 

58
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,240
Now I can put it all together. 
So I want to and differentiate 1 8th. 

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,126
I get 1 8th x. 
And then I want to, and I differentiate 

60
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:12,754
cos 4x over 8, and I get sin of 4x over 
32 and then I'll include the rest. 

61
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:20,125
So, I'll subtract sin of 2x over 4. 
I'll add a quarter x and I'll add some 

62
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:26,222
constant. 
And I could combine the one quarter x and 

63
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:33,662
the 1 8x, so I could right this as 3 8x 
plus sine of 4x over 32 minus sine of 2x 

64
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:41,130
over 4 plus c. 
I should say that in some cases you can 

65
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,639
get away with doing a bit less work. 
So I want to calculate the integral from 

66
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,117
zero to pi of sine to the fourth and I'll 
again start the same way, right I'm going 

67
00:05:52,117 --> 00:06:01,150
to integrate from zero to pi and I'll 
write this as sine squared squared. 

68
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,134
Just so I can see how the half angle 
formula is going to help me. 

69
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:10,024
Alright, now I'll use the half angle 
formula as the integral from zero to pi 

70
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:17,658
of 1 minus cosine2x over 2 squared, but 
now what do I want to do? 

71
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:22,923
Well, I'll expand that out again, so this 
is the integral from 0 to pi of 1 fourth 

72
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:28,269
Minus the cross term is one half cosign 
2x and then plus the cosign times squared 

73
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:33,800
2x over 4. 
And now there's a little trick. 

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,794
I'm integrating from 0 to pi cosign. 
Right I'm integrating cosign over an 

75
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:44,770
entire period. 
And that ends up being 0. 

76
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,630
So I can just throw this whole term away 
and now I can keep on going. 

77
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,760
I can also use the half angle formula 
here. 

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,427
So this is the integral from 0 to pi. 
well I've still got the 1/4 plus, and 

79
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:02,917
then what does this become? 
By the half angle formula, this is 1 

80
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,288
plus. 
And instead of 2x. 

81
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:10,553
It's cosine 4x over 8, but I would again, 
if I integrate cosine 4x, x going from 0 

82
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:18,598
to pi, that's integrating cosine ove 2 
complete periods that ends up cancelling. 

83
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,458
So I can just throw that term away, and 
all I'm really integrating now is a 

84
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:29,309
quarter plus an 8. 
Well thats 3 8ths, but I'm integrating 

85
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:36,410
over an interval of life pi, so this 
definite integral is 3 8ths pi. 

86
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,041
This turn out to be not so bad. 
See I'm getting an answer of 3 8ths pi, 

87
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:45,125
but that's not really the point right? 
The cool thing about setting this up as a 

88
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:51,395
definite integral is really just how easy 
it is to do the calculation since I can 

89
00:07:51,395 --> 00:08:00,773
throw away some terms along the way that 
I know would integrate to zero.
