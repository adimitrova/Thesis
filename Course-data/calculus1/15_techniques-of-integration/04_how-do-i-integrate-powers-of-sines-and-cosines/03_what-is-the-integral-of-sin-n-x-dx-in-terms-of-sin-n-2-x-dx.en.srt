1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,080
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,460
We've already seen how difficult it is to 
integrate powers of sin. 

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:16,910
For example, what's the inner goal from 0 
to power of a 2 of sin the 32nd power. 

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,676
Well it turns out that it's, what is 
this, 300540195 divided by 4294967296 

5
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:26,810
times pi. 
But how would I ever that. 

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:36,880
That looks so random and yet there's more 
going on here. 

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,760
In fact, this ends up being 3 times 3 
times 5 times 17 times 19 times 23 times 

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,320
29 times 31 all over 2 to the 32nd power. 
What? 

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,730
All those numbers suggest something's 
going on here that could hardly be an 

10
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,770
accident. 
The goal of computing, the goal of 

11
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,870
numbers, the goal of everything that 
we're doing in this course isn't just 

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,130
answers. 
It's insight. 

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,500
So how can we gain some insight into why 
that integral works out like that. 

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:15,740
Specifically our question is why does it 
factor, so nicely? 

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,575
Right I mean there's no reason at least 
at this point for it to work out so 

16
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:25,449
nicely so why does it factor so nicely? 
Well to gain some insight into this lets 

17
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:29,607
use parts to examine the relationship 
between the integral of sin to the nth 

18
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:33,954
power and sin to the n minus second 
power. 

19
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,842
Well, let me write that down. 
To answer this question, of why it 

20
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:41,400
factors is what I want to do is figure 
out some sort of relationship. 

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Between the interval from 0 to pi over 2 
of sin to the nth power and the interval 

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,990
from 0 to pi over 2 to the n minus second 
power. 

23
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,228
We'll use parts. 
So lets start with this and I gotta pick 

24
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:57,479
a u and a dv. 
So I'll have a u be a sin to the n minus 

25
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,438
1 and dv, which would be the rest of 
this, will just be sine x dx, so udv 

26
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:11,370
gives me this integrand. 
Now if that's u and that's dv, I gotta 

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,820
figure out what d, u, and v are supposed 
to be. 

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,363
Well, if dv is sin of x, then an 
antiderivative for that is minus cosine x 

29
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:23,983
and, if u is sin to the n minus 1, then 
du, we've gotta differentiate this, 

30
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:32,660
that'll be the chain rule. 
n minus 1 times sin to the n minus 2. 

31
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,670
And then times the derivative of this. 
What's the derivative of the inside? 

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,130
The derivative of sin is cosine, and then 
dx. 

33
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,230
Now we get a formular for parts. 
So this integral is u v. 

34
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:54,290
So sin, to the n minus 1, times cosine 
with a minus sin, evaluated at pi over 2 

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:01,110
and 0. 
Minus the interval from 0 to pi over 2 of 

36
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,190
v du, which is well here's n minus 1 sin 
to the n minus 2 cosine squared dx and 

37
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:15,685
I've got a minus sin there on the v so 
I'll make that plus. 

38
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:21,724
Alright, now when I plug in pi over 2 
that kills the cosine terms, and when I 

39
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:30,070
plug in 0, that kills the, the sin term. 
So this thing here is just 0, and that 

40
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,986
means this original integral is just the 
integral from 0 to pi over 2 of n minus 1 

41
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:46,529
times sin to the n minus 2 x. 
And instead of, cosine square, there I'll 

42
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:55,700
right that as 1 minus sin squared x d x. 
Now I can expand this out. 

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,000
This is, really the difference between 
two integrals after I expand. 

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,080
It's n minus 1 times the integral from 0 
to pi over 2 of sin to the n minus 2 x, 

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,396
then minus n minus 1 times the integral 
from 0 to pi over 2 of sin to the n minus 

46
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:27,030
2 times sine squared. 
Is just sin to the nth power dx. 

47
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,210
And we can solve this. 
So, this is what I've got at this point. 

48
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,029
I've that the integral from 0 to pi over 
2 of sin to the n x dx is equal to this, 

49
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:40,064
after I did parts. 
But now, I can add n minus 1 times the 

50
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:45,350
interval from 0 to pi over 2 sin to the 
nx dx to both sides. 

51
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,840
And what do I get, well I'll get n times 
the integral from 0 to pi over 2 sin to 

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:58,100
the n x dx is equal to. 
And on the other side I'll have n minus 1 

53
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,900
the integral from 0 to pi over 2 sin to 
the n minus 2 xdx. 

54
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,352
And I can divide both sides by n. 
And if I divide both sides by n, alright, 

55
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:15,140
I find that the integral from 0 to pi 
over 2 of sin to the n xdx is n minus 1 

56
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:24,000
over n times the integral from 0 to pi 
over 2 of sin to the n minus 2 xdx. 

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,965
So this formula is telling me how to 
compute the integral of sine to the nth 

58
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:33,340
power in terms of the integral of sin to 
the n minus second power. 

59
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,580
So I get started by knowing that the 
integral from 0 to to pi over 2 of sin to 

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,109
the 0 power of x dx. 
That's just the integral of 1 from 0 to 

61
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:50,210
pi over 2. 
Well that's just pi over 2. 

62
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,060
So, what's the integral of sine squared 
on the interval 0 to pi over 2. 

63
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, using this formula, when n equals 
2, I find that the integral from 0 to pi 

64
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,318
over 2 of sin squared x dx. 
This is when n equals 2, is 2 minus 1. 

65
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:14,235
Over 2, that's n minus 1 over n times the 
integral from 0 to pi over 2 of sin to 

66
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:19,615
the zeroth power. 
But I know what sin to the zeroth power 

67
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:24,640
is, it's just pi over 2. 
So this is 1 half 2 minus 1 over 2 times 

68
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:32,830
this which is pi over 2 which pi over 4. 
So the integral from 0 to power over 2 

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,068
sin squared x is just pi over 4. 
What's the integral of sine to the 

70
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:40,522
fourth? 
Well, let's use this formula when n 

71
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:48,330
equals 4 so the integral from 0 to pi 
over 2 signed to the fourth x dx. 

72
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,146
That'll be 4 minus 1 over 4 times the 
integral from 0 to pi over 2 of sin 

73
00:06:53,146 --> 00:07:01,490
squared xdx, and we just figured out what 
the integral of sin squared is right. 

74
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:09,506
This is 3 4th times pi over 4. 
What's the integral of sin to the 6th? 

75
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,720
So, that means I should look at this 
formula when n equals 6. 

76
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,912
So, the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of 
sin to the 6th x dx is, well if I put in 

77
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:23,192
n equals 6, I get 6 minus 1 over 6 times 
the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of sin 

78
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:31,438
to the 4th x dx, but I just figured that 
one out. 

79
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:37,549
So, this is 5 6th times, well here's the 
integral of sin to the 4th, times 3 4th 

80
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:42,840
times pi over 4. 
What's the integral of sin to the 8th? 

81
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,780
Well, that means I should use this 
formula when n equals 8. 

82
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,575
So, the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of 
sin to the 8th dx is, according to this 

83
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:57,845
when n equals 8, that's 8 minus 1 over 8 
times the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of 

84
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:05,650
sin to the 6th x dx. 
And we just figured out sin to the 6th. 

85
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,140
This is 8 minus 1 over 8. 
That's 7 over 8 times the integral of sin 

86
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,736
to the 6th. 
Which is 5 6th times 3 4ths times pi over 

87
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:21,450
4. 
Okay, okay, we're seeing a pattern. 

88
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,670
What's the integral of sin to the 32nd 
power? 

89
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:31,130
So, the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of 
sin to the 32nd power. 

90
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:37,578
Just following this pattern will be 31 
over 32 times 29 over 30 times 27 over 

91
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:43,818
28, and I'm going to keep on going until 
I get down to 5 over 6 times 3 over 4 and 

92
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:53,490
then finally times pi over 4. 
Now we can cancel like crazy. 

93
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,224
So this 3 and this 6 give me a 2. 
This 5 and this 10 give me a 2. 

94
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:03,144
This 7 and the 14 give me a 2. 
The 9 and the 18 gives me a 2. 

95
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:12,474
The 11 and the 22 gives me a 2. 
The 13 and the 26 gives me a 2. 

96
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:18,340
The 15 and the 30 gives me a 2. 
The 17 survives, all right. 

97
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,898
Let's see what else I can cancel. 
the 19 is going to survive. 

98
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:30,420
The 21, however, well the 21 is going to 
be killed by a 7 somewhere. 

99
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,460
I can find a 7 in in the 28, so this 
gives me a 4 and this 21 gives me a 3 

100
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:43,266
leftover can I kill that 3 somehow? 
Yeah, that 3 can be killed by this 12 

101
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:47,720
giving me 4 left over. 
So this is entirely gone now. 

102
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,240
the 23 is going to survive. 
What about the 25? 

103
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,436
Do I have any 5's? 
Well, we've got a 5 in this 20, that 

104
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:58,902
gives me a 4, and then I've got a 5 here 
which will end up surviving. 

105
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:02,670
I've got a 27 here. 
Do I have any 3's down here? 

106
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,830
Well I've got a 3 in this 24. 
I can make this this 24 into an 8, if I 

107
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:14,241
convert this 27 into a 9. 
the 29 is going to survive and the 31 is 

108
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:19,646
is going to survive. 
So in the numerator, what all do I have? 

109
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:27,786
Well, the numerator, I've got a 31, a 29. 
A 9, a 5, a 23, a 19, and a 17, and way 

110
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:34,974
over here, a pi. 
And in the denominator I've got a whole 

111
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,980
bunch of of 2's, right? 
How many 2's do I have? 

112
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,401
Well I've got 2 to what power? 
I've got five 2's there, another 2 here, 

113
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:50,221
two more 2's, a 2, three more 2's, 
another 2, two more 2's, another 2, four 

114
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:56,429
more 2's, one more 2, two more 2's, one 
more 2, three more 2's, one more two, and 

115
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:05,510
then here, another four 2's. 
And that's going to figure what are all 

116
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,870
of these number that I get when I add 
these things up and 5 plus 1 plus 2 plus 

117
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,790
1 plus 3 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 4 plus 
1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 3 plus 1 plus 4. 

118
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,190
That's 32 two's in the denominator. 
This was a triumph. 

119
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:33,586
I'm making a note here huge success.
