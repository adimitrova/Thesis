we already know to handle 
integration problems integrand 
is a powers sines cosines 
example, i antidifferentiate 
sine to odd power 

trading in one sins 
cosines 
lets make this really concrete 
instead talking an odd power 
well lets make 
i antidifferentiate sin to th 
power 
yeah, i rewrite this problem sin 
x times sin squared x to th 
power, sin square to th 
power gives copies sin times 
sin gives copies sin, 
we trade sin squared cos 
signs right, sin squared is minus cos 
sign squared to th power 
so if i this antidifferentiation 
problem i need to is this 
antidifferentiation problem 
i that a substitution 
so make substitution u equals cosine 
x in that case d u is minus sign x 
dx 
maybe youre complaining you dont 
see a minus sign 
youll see sin, ill 
put a pair cancelling minus sins 
there, i see a minus sin next dx so 
we got a du rest i write in 
terms u 
specifically, this becomes negative, 
n is derivative minus u squared to 
power du, is whats left 
this antidifferentiation problem that i 
is a little bit annoying 
cause i guess i gotta expand this thing 
to find an antiderivative this, 
i 
if instead id an even power 
sine 
well, maybe ill antidifferentiate sine 
to fouth power 
right 
so this is an odd power an even 
power 
thats harder, i cant trade in 
sins cosines i need one 
left to make substitution work 
instead, ill use an identity, half 
angle formula 
lets replace sined squared x 
minus cosine x 
lets replace cosign squared 
x plus cosign x 
help 
well i rewrite this integral 
integral sin squared, squared 
i use this half angle 
identity 
this is integral 
sin squared 
sin squared is minus cos x 
right 
equal 
still to square that, dx 
now, i expand 
so, i get this is 
integrating 
well, cos x term, squared is 
cosigned squared x 
theres cross term 
half times minus cosign x 
theres 
so i end getting minus half 
cosigned x 
theres one half term squared 
plus a quarter, so i to 
this integration problem 
i split that integrals 
so this gives integral cos sign 
squared x dx minus integral 
cos sign x dx plus integral 
th dx 
now, second third integration 
problem i do, im going to copy 
this one 
integral cos squared x dx 
this, here, well i could this 
making a substitution 
u equals x, say 
ill get that this is sine x 
divided 
if i integrate a quarter, i get th 
x 
that first one 
i integrate cosine squared 
so, to handle this, i repeat 
trick half angle identity 
im looking integrating cosign 
squared x 
so ill replace x x ill turn 
this a x 
so i use this identity 
that go 
well i get instead this integral 
plus cosine x instead 
ill copy 
things 
sin x plus a quarter x 
i put together 
so i want to differentiate th 
i get th x 
i want to, i differentiate 
cos x , i get sin x 
ill include rest 
so, ill subtract sin x 
ill add a quarter x ill add 
constant 
i could combine one quarter x 
x, so i could right this x 
plus sine x minus sine x 
plus c 
i say that in cases you 
get away a bit less work 
so i want to calculate integral 
zero to pi sine to fourth ill 
start way, right im going 
to integrate zero to pi ill 
write this sine squared squared 
so i see half angle 
formula is going to help 
alright, ill use half angle 
formula integral zero to pi 
minus cosinex squared, 
i want to 
well, ill expand that again, so this 
is integral to pi fourth 
minus cross term is one half cosign 
x plus cosign times squared 
x 
theres a little trick 
im integrating to pi cosign 
right im integrating cosign an 
entire period 
that ends 
so i throw this whole term away 
i keep going 
i also use half angle formula 
here 
so this is integral to pi 
well ive still got plus, 
this become 
half angle formula, this is 
plus 
instead x 
cosine x , i would again, 
if i integrate cosine x, x going 
to pi, thats integrating cosine ove 
complete periods that ends cancelling 
so i throw that term away, 
im really integrating is a 
quarter plus an 
well thats ths, im integrating 
an interval life pi, so this 
definite integral is ths pi 
this turn to so bad 
see im getting an answer ths pi, 
thats really point right 
cool thing setting this a 
definite integral is really easy 
is to calculation since i 
throw away terms along way that 
i know would integrate to zero
