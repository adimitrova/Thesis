2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,210
Armed with the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,990
We can no evaluate definite integrals,
just, by taking antiderivatives.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,620
[LAUGH] Of course, just, is really
overstating it a little bit.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,029
It can be quite difficult to find an
antiderivative.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,910
And the trouble is that it's hard to run
our differentiation rules in reverse.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,210
And remember a long, long time ago, we
learned about the chain rule.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,740
And if you take the chain rule, and you
run it in reverse, you get u substitution.

9
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:38,860
The difficulty though, is you know, when
you're doing u substitution, you

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,900
gotta make a choice for u, and that can be
pretty hard.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,590
Well now, we want to do the same kind of
game with other differentiation rules.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,010
I want to take the product rule, and run
the product rule in reverse.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,034
We're going to call that integration by
parts and,

14
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,770
by being clever, we'll be able to evaluate
a

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,506
ton more integrals by doing them, by
parts,

16
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:03,070
by using the product rule in reverse on
them.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,842
And one of those cool integrals that we'll
be able

18
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:09,259
to evaluate, our integrals of powers of
sines and cosines.

19
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,380
And I think maybe it sounds a little bit
dry.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,580
But I think it's actually pretty fun to
see how we can do, these very fearsome

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,646
looking integrals, with just a little bit
of help from the product rule.
