armed fundamental theorem 
calculus 
we evaluate definite integrals, 
just, taking antiderivatives 
laugh course, just, is really 
overstating a little bit 
quite difficult to find an 
antiderivative 
trouble is that hard to run 
differentiation rules in reverse 
remember a long, long time ago, we 
learned chain rule 
if you take chain rule, you 
run in reverse, you get u substitution 
difficulty though, is you know, 
youre u substitution, you 
gotta make a choice u, that 
pretty hard 
well now, we want to kind 
game differentiation rules 
i want to take product rule, run 
product rule in reverse 
going to call that integration 
parts and, 
clever, well able to evaluate 
a 
ton integrals them, 
parts, 
using product rule in reverse 

one cool integrals that well 
able 
to evaluate, integrals powers 
sines cosines 
i think maybe sounds a little bit 
dry 
i think actually pretty fun to 
see we do, fearsome 
looking integrals, a little bit 
help product rule
