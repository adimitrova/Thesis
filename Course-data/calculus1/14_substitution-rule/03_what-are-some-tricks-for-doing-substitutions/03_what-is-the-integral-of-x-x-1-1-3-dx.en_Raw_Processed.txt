music generally speaking, 
antidifferentiating things radicals 
is difficult 
example, lets try to find an 
antiderivative of, x cube root 
x plus dx right 
lets try to antidifferentiate this 
i make a substitution to improve 
integrand 
so substitution i want to make 
well, i really choices, i mean, 
one thing i could is i could make ux 
plus in that case, du is dx 
if u is x plus , x is u minus 
, i rewrite this 
antidifferentiation problem 
instead this becomes antiderivative 
that x, u minus still cube root, 
instead x plus , u 
dx becomes du 
i, i could actually this, im 
going to head that path 
instead, i want to show you a trick 
you get rid radical 
together 
so instead lets set u, to grab 
whole denominator 
so u will cube root x plus 
in that case, u cubed is x plus 
or, in words, x is u cubed minus 
that tells dx is 
in that case, dx is u squared du 
i could make this substitution 
this transforms this integration problem 
to, antiderivative x becomes 
ucubed minus 
whole denominator becomes u 
dx here is a u squared 
du, so ill write u squared du 
thats a polynomial 
so ill simplify this a bit, this is 
antiderivative of, is this here, u 
cubed u times u squared, thats u 
to th minus u times u 
squared thats minus u, du 
this, this is a polynomial, so i 
antidifferentiate this quickly 
this antiderivative is ths u to 
th, minus halves u squared plus c 
now, well replace u 
equals in terms x 
so u, remember, is cube root x 
plus , so putting that in here, i get 
ths, instead u x plus to 
rd to th 
so to rds power, minus halves x 
plus to rd squared, is to 
rds power plus c 
to make easy to talk this 
particular technique, a name 
rationalizing substitution 
original problem a cube root in 
it, i made a substitution to get rid 
radical, a rationalizing 
a challenge u substitutions is 
that there really multiple paths that 
you take to correct answer 
even apparent successful a 
particular substitution might until 
youve started applying it, right 
you to take that first bite 
you realize whether youre eating 
food
