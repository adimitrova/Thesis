1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,957
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:10,963
Even integrating something as "easy" as a 
polynomial can be rather surprising. 

3
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:19,103
Let's integrate from x equals 0 to 1 just 
the polynomial x plus 10 times x minus 1 

4
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:27,238
to the 10th power dx. 
So there's some integration problem, just 

5
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:33,000
an integration problem for a polynomial. 
Your first inclination might be oh, I 

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,350
know what to do, just have no fear. 
I'll just expand everything in sight. 

7
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,130
So, we've got x plus 10, times x minus 1, 
to the 10th. 

8
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,395
Which you could expand by, you know the 
binomial theorem if you want. 

9
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:52,451
We're going to get x to the 11th minus 55 
x to the 9th. 

10
00:00:52,451 --> 00:01:00,011
Plus 330 x to the 8th minus 990 x to the 
7th plus 1,848 times x to the 6th mi, I 

11
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:08,085
mean this is ridiculous. 
Arr, yeah, so I mean yeah, you, you could 

12
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:11,060
do that. 
You could just expand everything out. 

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,630
But there's a better way right. 
We can make use of U-substitution. 

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,580
Yeah, we're not going to do that, let's 
do something else. 

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:26,250
So instead let's set u equal x minus 1, 
and I could solve this for x. 

16
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,880
That means that x is u plus 1. 
All right, if I just add 1 to both sides. 

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,970
And I could make this substitution in 
this problem. 

18
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:46,310
So this integral from x goes from 0 to 1, 
is, what's x plus 10 if x is u plus 1. 

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,020
I could write u plus 1 plus 10. 
And whats x minus one, thats just u to 

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,732
the tenth power, and whats dx well if u 
is x du is dx. 

21
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:02,002
So its the same as trying to do this 
integration problem. 

22
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:06,812
In some text books this technique of 
startign with the use of substitution but 

23
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:11,194
then solving for x. 
This is sometimes called back 

24
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:15,100
substitution. 
regardless of the name, let's proceed. 

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:23,940
So this is the integral, x goes from 0 to 
1 of u plus 11 times u to the 10th du. 

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,025
I could expand this, and that's the same 
as the 

27
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:35,074
Integral x goes from zero to one of u to 
the 11th. 

28
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:40,361
Plus 11 u to the 10th du. 
But this is just asking me to anti 

29
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:44,305
differentiate a polynomial which I can 
definitely do. 

30
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:51,440
Alright. 
This is u to the 12 over 12. 

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,140
Plus, what's an anti-derivative of 11 u 
to the 10th, it's just u to the 11th. 

32
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,340
But now I've got a little bit of an 
issue, right? 

33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,330
I've got x going from 0 to 1. 
So here is u going from what to what? 

34
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,210
Yeah, so how do we deal with those end 
points? 

35
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:15,180
Well, when x is 0, u is minus 1. 
So I'll put a minus 1 there. 

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,035
And when x is 1, u is 0. 
So I'll put a zero there. 

37
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:22,467
And now, this is just as easy as plugging 
in zero, plugging in minus 1, and taking 

38
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:26,090
the difference. 
So what do I get when I plug in zero? 

39
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,000
I just get zero. 
And what do I get when I plug in minus 1? 

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,396
Well, I get minus 1 to the 12th over 12. 
Plus minus 1 to the 11th. 

41
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:42,638
Alright minus 1 to the 12 is just 1. 
So this is 1 12th. 

42
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:48,700
And minus 1 to the 11th well that's 
negative 1. 

43
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:55,900
So I've got 0 minus what's this a 12 
minus one that's negative 11th 12th. 

44
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,430
But at 0 minus negative 11, 12ths. 
So the integral is 11, 12ths. 

45
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,950
So the calculation turned out to be 
pretty nice. 

46
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,530
I mean 11 12ths, isn't a particularly 
difficult fraction to come up with. 

47
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,188
The crazy thing to think about is that we 
could have approached this just by 

48
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:17,999
expanding everything in sight. 
Yeah, I really could have expanded this 

49
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:22,459
thing out, and then just started 
anti-differentiating you know. 

50
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:26,869
And finding this really was you know, I 
don't know x to the 12th over 12, minus I 

51
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:31,090
think it's 11 halves, x to the tenth plus 
a hundered and ten thirds x to the ninth 

52
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,903
right. 
And it would keep on goign and id just 

53
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,935
evaluate that, exit one exit zero and 
take the differenc i mean i really could 

54
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:45,450
have done this by expanding. 
And somehow that would of ended up giving 

55
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,783
me the same answer right, of eleven 
twelths. 

56
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:52,815
Except that had I gone down that path, I 
would have been certain to have walked 

57
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:58,676
right into an arithmetic error. 
The world of mathematical solutions is 

58
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:02,120
not divided into correct solutions and 
incorrect solutions. 

59
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,016
It's really more subtle than that. 
Mathematical solutions come in a ton of 

60
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,522
varieties. 
Right, there's easy solutions and hard 

61
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:11,230
solutions. 
There's solutions that are defending you 

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,164
against arithmetic errors. 
And then there's solutions that are just 

63
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,330
walking you right into an arithmetic 
mess. 

64
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,988
The fun of u substitution isn't just 
being able to do integrals, it's being 

65
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,941
able to do integrals in an efficient way 
that protects you from those arithmetic 

66
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,090
errors.
