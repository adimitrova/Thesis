even integrating something easy a 
polynomial rather surprising 
lets integrate x equals to 
polynomial x plus times x minus 
to th power dx 
so theres integration problem, 
an integration problem a polynomial 
first inclination might oh, i 
know to do, fear 
ill expand everything in sight 
so, weve got x plus , times x minus , 
to th 
you could expand by, you know 
binomial theorem if you want 
going to get x to th minus 
x to th 
plus x to th minus x to 
th plus , times x to th mi, i 
mean this is ridiculous 
arr, yeah, so i mean yeah, you, you could 
that 
you could expand everything 
theres a better way right 
we make use usubstitution 
yeah, going to that, lets 
something else 
so instead lets set u equal x minus , 
i could solve this x 
that means that x is u plus 
right, if i add to sides 
i could make this substitution in 
this problem 
so this integral x goes to , 
is, whats x plus if x is u plus 
i could write u plus plus 
whats x minus one, thats u to 
tenth power, whats dx well if u 
is x du is dx 
so trying to this 
integration problem 
in text books this technique 
startign use substitution 
solving x 
this is sometimes called back 
substitution 
regardless name, lets proceed 
so this is integral, x goes to 
u plus times u to th du 
i could expand this, thats 

integral x goes zero to one u to 
th 
plus u to th du 
this is asking to anti 
differentiate a polynomial i 
definitely 
alright 
this is u to 
plus, whats an antiderivative u 
to th, u to th 
ive got a little bit an 
issue, right 
ive got x going to 
so here is u going to 
yeah, so we deal end 
points 
well, x is , u is minus 
so ill put a minus there 
x is , u is 
so ill put a zero there 
now, this is easy plugging 
in zero, plugging in minus , taking 
difference 
so i get i plug in zero 
i get zero 
i get i plug in minus 
well, i get minus to th 
plus minus to th 
alright minus to is 
so this is th 
minus to th well thats 
negative 
so ive got minus whats this a 
minus one thats negative th th 
minus negative , ths 
so integral is , ths 
so calculation turned to 
pretty nice 
i mean ths, isnt a particularly 
difficult fraction to come 
crazy thing to think is that we 
could approached this 
expanding everything in sight 
yeah, i really could expanded this 
thing out, started 
antidifferentiating you know 
finding this really you know, i 
dont know x to th , minus i 
think halves, x to tenth plus 
a hundered ten thirds x to ninth 
right 
would keep goign id 
evaluate that, exit one exit zero 
take differenc i mean i really could 
done this expanding 
somehow that would ended giving 
answer right, eleven 
twelths 
except that i gone that path, i 
would certain to walked 
right an arithmetic error 
world mathematical solutions is 
divided correct solutions 
incorrect solutions 
really subtle that 
mathematical solutions come in a ton 
varieties 
right, theres easy solutions hard 
solutions 
theres solutions that defending you 
arithmetic errors 
theres solutions that 
walking you right an arithmetic 
mess 
fun u substitution isnt 
able to integrals, 
able to integrals in an efficient way 
that protects you arithmetic 
errors
