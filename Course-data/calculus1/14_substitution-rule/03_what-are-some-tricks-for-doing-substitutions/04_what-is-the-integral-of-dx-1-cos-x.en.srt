00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,047
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:09,272
Sometimes the best substitution to make 
isn't even visible until after we've 

3
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:12,861
messed around with the integrand some 
how. 

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:20,172
For example, what's the antiderivative of 
1 over 1 plus cosine x? 

5
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:24,721
Dx, what can you do? 
your first move might be to try the 

6
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,867
substitution u equals cosine x, which 
case du is negative sine x dx, but 

7
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:35,492
there's no visible sine x in the 
integrand. 

8
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:39,512
Well, since we're talking about invisible 
substitutions, we should try to mess 

9
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:44,143
around with the integrand. 
Instead of doing that, let's try a 

10
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:49,916
different trick. 
Let's try to multiply 1 over 1 plus 

11
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:59,240
cosine x by 1 minus cosine x divided by 1 
minus cosine x. 

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,290
This doesn't change the integrand at all, 
because this is just 1. 

13
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,782
This trick makes a hitherto invisible 
substitution visible. 

14
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:12,100
I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit. 
Let's first apply a trig identity. 

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,524
Oh, this is 1 minus cosine x in the 
numerator divided by, that's 1 minus 

16
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:27,460
cosine squared x, and then the trig 
identity is that 1 minus cosine squared 

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:37,303
x, well that's sine squared x. 
So now I want to antidifferentiate 1 

18
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:42,530
minus cosine x over sine squared x dx. 
Well even that isn't so great. 

19
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,381
Let's split it up. 
Well then I get, that this is 

20
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:54,337
antiderivative 1 over sine squared x dx 
minus the antiderivative of cosine x over 

21
00:01:54,337 --> 00:02:01,009
sine squared x dx. 
Now that first integral is one that I can 

22
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,250
do. 
Rewrite it as the antiderivative of 

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,008
cosecant squared x. 
You know, I just have to think, do I know 

24
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,357
any function whose derivative is cosecant 
squared. 

25
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:24,933
Yes, negative cotangent is an 
antiderivative of cosecant squared, of of 

26
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:29,000
x. 
What about that other intergral? 

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,331
Well I could read this as cotangent times 
cosecant and just recognize the 

28
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:38,443
antiderivative that way. 
But to demonstrate the technique I can 

29
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:42,987
also apply u substitution to that 
antidifferentiation problem so let's let 

30
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:47,176
u equal sine x, and in that case, du is 
cosine x dx, which is great, because 

31
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:55,815
that's the numerator there. 
So this this antidifferentiation problem 

32
00:02:55,815 --> 00:03:01,251
becomes what? 
This is the antiderivative of du over u 

33
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:06,211
squared. 
And I just gotta think, how do I, 

34
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:13,190
antidifferentiate u to the negative 
second power? 

35
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,895
Well that, is by the power rule plus1 
over u plus c. 

36
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:27,794
Alright, If I differentiate one over u, 
that gives me negative 1 over u squared. 

37
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:32,018
Okay, but I don't want my answer to be in 
terms of u, right, I want my answer to be 

38
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:37,020
in terms of x. 
So this is negative cotangent x plus, 

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,782
what's 1 over u, well that's 1 over sine 
x which, if I wanted to, I could write as 

40
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:49,060
cosecant x plus C. 
Let's put it all together. 

41
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,604
So what I'm claiming here is that the 
antiderivative of 1 over 1 plus cosine x 

42
00:03:54,604 --> 00:04:01,640
dx is negative cotangent plus cosecant, 
plus some constant. 

43
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,140
If you have it already, I hope you're 
getting the idea that there's some really 

44
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:16,073
clever things that you can try to make 
these substitutions work.
