.
we
already
know
how
to
integrate
.
and
by
integrate
,
i
mean
,
anti-differentiate
some
fractions
.
for
instance
,
here
is
an
anti-differentiation
problem
.
let
's
anti-differentiate
4x
plus
3
dx
.
and
i
can
do
that
with
a
u
substitution
.
we
have
to
choose
what
u
should
be
equal
to
.
i
'll
set
u
equal
4x
plus
3
,
so
that
du
is
,
what
's
the
derivative
of
this
,
is
just
4
,
and
then
the
differential
of
u
is
4dx
.
now
,
i
do
n't
see
a
4dx
in
my
integrand
here
,
but
i
can
manufacture
a
4dx
.
if
i
multiply
by
1
4th
and
4.
that
's
like
doing
nothing
,
right
?
those
cancel
,
but
now
i
've
got
a
4dx
in
my
integrand
.
so
,
the
original
anti-differentiation
problem
is
1
quarter
of
anti-derivative
1
over
u
du
.
and
i
know
an
anti-derivative
1
over
u
du
.
alright
?
it
's
log
of
the
absolute
value
of
u
plus
c.
and
,
i
've
got
to
make
sure
to
include
that
constant
on
the
outside
of
1
quarter
.
but
i
do
n't
want
to
write
down
my
answer
in
terms
of
u
,
i
'd
like
my
answer
to
be
in
terms
of
x.
right
?
i
'm
asking
for
an
anti-derivative
1
over
4x
plus
3
,
not
somethings
in
terms
of
u.
so
,
i
'll
just
replace
u
with
what
it
's
equal
to
.
so
,
altogether
,
i
got
1
quarter
log
of
the
absolute
value
of
4x
plus
3
,
plus
c.
so
,
there
's
my
anti-derivative
of
this
fraction
.
i
also
know
how
to
anti-differentiate
some
reciprocals
of
a
quadratic
polynomials
.
at
least
,
here
's
a
special
case
what
's
the
anti-derivative
1
over
x
squared
plus
one
dx
?
well
,
if
you
remember
back
,
i
know
a
function
whose
derivative
is
this
.
alright
.
it
's
the
inverse
tangent
function
arctan
.
so
,
at
least
i
know
how
to
anti-differentiate
the
reciporical
of
this
particular
quadratic
polynomial
.
wonderfully
,
i
can
use
that
special
case
,
the
anti-derivative
of
1
over
x
squared
plus
1
,
to
anti-differentiate
the
reciporicals
of
of
other
quadratic
polynomials
.
for
example
,
can
we
find
an
anti-derivative
of
1
over
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7
dx
?
can
you
think
of
a
function
whose
derivative
is
this
?
i
ca
n't
come
off
with
an
anti-derivative
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
.
but
,
i
've
got
a
trick
up
my
sleeve
,
the
trick
is
completing
the
square
.
what
that
means
is
that
i
'm
going
to
rewrite
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7
and
i
want
it
to
look
more
like
the
example
i
know
,
right
?
the
example
that
i
know
is
this
thing
.
i
know
that
the
anti-derivative
of
1
over
something
squared
plus
something
.
so
,
i
'm
just
trying
to
rewrite
this
quadratic
polynomial
,
so
it
looks
more
like
that
.
so
,
i
'm
going
to
try
to
rewrite
it
,
so
it
looks
like
x
plus
,
you
know
,
something
squared
plus
plus
something
.
the
trouble
is
how
to
find
the
blue
and
the
red
somethings
.
let
's
do
some
algebra
.
so
,
i
'm
going
to
write
this
as
x
plus
,
instead
of
just
a
squiggle
,
i
'll
call
it
a
,
squared
plus
some
other
constant
b.
and
if
i
expand
that
out
,
what
do
i
get
?
well
,
i
get
x
squared
plus
a
cross
term
2ax
,
plus
i
got
an
a
squared
term
.
and
then
a
b
left
over
that
i
add
on
.
so
,
i
'm
trying
to
make
this
quadratic
polynomial
look
like
this
.
and
the
only
term
that
i
've
got
with
an
x
here
is
this
2a
should
be
4.
alright
?
so
,
let
me
write
that
down
.
so
,
2a
is
equal
to
4.
and
that
tells
me
what
a
is
.
a
should
be
2.
i
'll
finish
by
finding
b.
so
,
i
've
got
x
plus
2
squared
plus
some
b
is
equal
to
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7.
x
plus
2
squared
is
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
2
squared
,
which
is
4
,
plus
b
,
is
suppose
to
be
equal
to
this
.
and
,
that
's
tells
me
what
b
had
better
be
.
right
?
i
've
got
4x
and
i
've
got
an
x
squared
,
then
i
've
got
a
4
plus
b
is
7.
alright
,
so
4
plus
b
is
7
,
so
b
is
3.
let
's
summarize
.
so
,
what
i
've
got
here
is
that
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7
can
instead
be
written
as
x
plus
,
in
this
case
,
2
squared
plus
,
and
then
for
b
,
i
've
got
3.
so
,
i
've
rewritten
this
quadratic
polynomial
as
a
linear
term
squared
plus
some
constant
.
now
,
i
'll
use
that
fact
in
the
integration
problem
.
right
,
the
original
integral
is
1
over
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7.
and
instead
of
doing
that
integral
,
i
can
do
the
integral
of
1
over
this
equivalent
thing
,
x
plus
2
squared
plus
3
dx
.
that
still
does
n't
exactly
look
like
the
anti-derivative
problem
that
resulted
in
arctan
.
remember
,
the
anti-derivative
here
that
gave
us
arctan
x
has
a
plus
one
,
but
the
thing
we
're
looking
at
here
has
a
plus
3.
so
,
i
can
fix
that
.
i
can
get
a
constant
here
.
i
can
factor
out
something
.
i
'll
factor
out
a
third
and
that
will
be
integral
of
1
over
1
over
3
times
x
plus
2
squared
plus
1
dx
,
right
?
this
is
the
same
thing
as
this
,
because
this
3
times
a
third
is
just
the
1
here
that
i
have
n't
written
.
and
3
times
plus
1
gives
me
this
plus
3.
i
'll
make
a
substitution
.
now
,
i
'll
make
this
substitution
.
you
might
think
that
i
could
use
a
substitution
where
u
equals
1
3rd
x
plus
2
squared
.
but
then
,
i
need
an
x
in
the
numerator
,
right
?
so
instead
,
i
'm
going
to
make
it
slowly
different
substitution
,
i
'm
just
going
to
make
this
looks
like
u
squared
.
so
,
i
'll
set
u
to
be
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
times
x
plus
2.
so
now
,
this
denominator
looks
like
1
over
u
squared
plus
1.
and
in
that
case
,
what
's
du
?
well
,
that
means
du
is
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
dx
.
now
,
what
does
the
integral
become
?
you
might
be
concerned
that
you
do
n't
see
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
dx
here
,
but
i
can
manufacture
one
of
those
.
if
i
make
this
into
the
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
,
i
can
put
a
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
here
,
without
affecting
anything
.
and
now
,
i
've
got
a
du
.
so
,
this
anti-differentiation
problem
becomes
1
over
the
square
root
of
3.
the
anti
derivative
of
1
over
this
,
here
,
is
u
squared
plus
1.
and
this
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
dx
,
that
is
now
my
du
.
and
that
's
arctan
.
so
,
this
is
one
over
the
square
root
of
anti-derivative
of
this
is
arctan
u
plus
c.
now
,
i
just
have
to
replace
that
u
with
its
value
in
terms
of
x.
so
,
this
is
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
arctan
,
and
u
here
is
this
,
so
i
'll
write
that
in
here
for
u
,
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
times
x
plus
2
plus
c.
and
now
,
i
'm
in
a
position
to
state
a
conclusion
.
the
original
question
was
asking
for
an
anti-derivative
of
1
over
x
squared
plus
4x
plus
7
,
and
we
found
it
.
it
's
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
times
arctan
,
1
over
the
square
root
of
3
times
x
plus
two
,
plus
some
constant
.
so
,
we
've
anti-differentiated
this
reciprocal
of
this
quadratic
polynomial
.
well
,
fantastic
,
and
the
same
trick
works
in
other
situations
as
well
.
really
,
anytime
you
've
been
handed
a
quadratic
polynomial
but
you
wish
you
'd
been
given
something
squared
plus
a
number
,
you
should
try
completing
the
square
.
