sometimes the best substitution to make 
isn't even visible until after we've 
messed around with the integrand some 
how. 
for example, what's the antiderivative of 
1 over 1 plus cosine x? 
dx, what can you do? 
your first move might be to try the 
substitution u equals cosine x, which 
case du is negative sine x dx, but 
there's no visible sine x in the 
integrand. 
well, since we're talking about invisible 
substitutions, we should try to mess 
around with the integrand. 
instead of doing that, let's try a 
different trick. 
let's try to multiply 1 over 1 plus 
cosine x by 1 minus cosine x divided by 1 
minus cosine x. 
this doesn't change the integrand at all, 
because this is just 1. 
this trick makes a hitherto invisible 
substitution visible. 
i'm getting ahead of myself a little bit. 
let's first apply a trig identity. 
oh, this is 1 minus cosine x in the 
numerator divided by, that's 1 minus 
cosine squared x, and then the trig 
identity is that 1 minus cosine squared 
x, well that's sine squared x. 
so now i want to antidifferentiate 1 
minus cosine x over sine squared x dx. 
well even that isn't so great. 
let's split it up. 
well then i get, that this is 
antiderivative 1 over sine squared x dx 
minus the antiderivative of cosine x over 
sine squared x dx. 
now that first integral is one that i can 
do. 
rewrite it as the antiderivative of 
cosecant squared x. 
you know, i just have to think, do i know 
any function whose derivative is cosecant 
squared. 
yes, negative cotangent is an 
antiderivative of cosecant squared, of of 
x. 
what about that other intergral? 
well i could read this as cotangent times 
cosecant and just recognize the 
antiderivative that way. 
but to demonstrate the technique i can 
also apply u substitution to that 
antidifferentiation problem so let's let 
u equal sine x, and in that case, du is 
cosine x dx, which is great, because 
that's the numerator there. 
so this this antidifferentiation problem 
becomes what? 
this is the antiderivative of du over u 
squared. 
and i just gotta think, how do i, 
antidifferentiate u to the negative 
second power? 
well that, is by the power rule plus1 
over u plus c. 
alright, if i differentiate one over u, 
that gives me negative 1 over u squared. 
okay, but i don't want my answer to be in 
terms of u, right, i want my answer to be 
in terms of x. 
so this is negative cotangent x plus, 
what's 1 over u, well that's 1 over sine 
x which, if i wanted to, i could write as 
cosecant x plus c. 
let's put it all together. 
so what i'm claiming here is that the 
antiderivative of 1 over 1 plus cosine x 
dx is negative cotangent plus cosecant, 
plus some constant. 
if you have it already, i hope you're 
getting the idea that there's some really 
clever things that you can try to make 
these substitutions work.
