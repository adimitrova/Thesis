we already know to integrate 
integrate, i mean, 
antidifferentiate fractions 
instance, here is an 
antidifferentiation problem 
lets antidifferentiate x plus dx 
i that a u substitution 
we to choose u equal 
to 
ill set u equal x plus , so that du 
is, whats derivative this, is 
, differential u is 
dx 
now, i dont see a dx in integrand 
here, i manufacture a dx 
if i multiply th 
thats like nothing, right 
cancel, ive got a dx in 
integrand 
so, original antidifferentiation 
problem is quarter antiderivative 
u du 
i know an antiderivative u 
du 
alright 
log absolute value u plus 
c 
and, ive got to make sure to include 
that constant outside 
quarter 
i dont want to write answer 
in terms u, id like answer to 
in terms x 
right 
im asking an antiderivative 
x plus , somethings in terms u 
so, ill replace u 
equal to 
so, altogether, i got quarter log 
absolute value x plus , plus c 
so, theres antiderivative this 
fraction 
i also know to antidifferentiate 
reciprocals a quadratic 
polynomials 
least, heres a special case whats 
antiderivative x squared plus 
one dx 
well, if you remember back, i know a 
function whose derivative is this 
alright 
inverse tangent function arctan 
so, least i know to 
antidifferentiate reciporical 
this particular quadratic polynomial 
wonderfully, i use that special case, 
antiderivative x squared 
plus , to antidifferentiate 
reciporicals quadratic 
polynomials 
example, we find an 
antiderivative x squared plus 
x plus dx 
you think a function whose 
derivative is this 
i cant come an antiderivative 
top head 
but, ive got a trick sleeve, 
trick is completing square 
that means is that im going to 
rewrite x squared plus x plus i 
want to look like example i 
know, right 
example that i know is this thing 
i know that antiderivative 
something squared plus something 
so, im trying to rewrite this 
quadratic polynomial, so looks 
like that 
so, im going to try to rewrite it, so 
looks like x plus, you know, something 
squared plus plus something 
trouble is to find blue 
red somethings 
lets algebra 
so, im going to write this x plus, 
instead a squiggle, ill call 
a,squared plus constant b 
if i expand that out, i get 
well, i get x squared plus a cross term 
ax, plus i got an a squared term 
a b left that i add 
so, im trying to make this quadratic 
polynomial look like this 
term that ive got an x 
here is this a 
alright 
so, let write that 
so, a is equal to 
that tells a is 
a 
ill finish finding b 
so, ive got x plus squared plus b 
is equal to x squared plus x plus 
x plus squared is x squared plus x 
plus squared, is , plus b, is 
suppose to equal to this 
and, thats tells b better 

right 
ive got x ive got an x squared, 
ive got a plus b is 
alright, so plus b is , so b is 
lets summarize 
so, ive got here is that x squared 
plus x plus instead written 
x plus, in this case, squared plus, 
b, ive got 
so, ive rewritten this quadratic 
polynomial a linear term squared plus 
constant 
now, ill use that fact in 
integration problem 
right, original integral is x 
squared plus x plus 
instead that integral, i 
integral this equivalent 
thing, x plus squared plus dx 
that still doesnt exactly look like 
antiderivative problem that resulted in 
arctan 
remember, antiderivative here that 
gave us arctan x a plus one, 
thing looking here a plus 
so, i fix that 
i get a constant here 
i factor something 
ill factor a third that will 
integral times x plus 
squared plus dx, right 
this is thing this, 
this times a third is here 
that i havent written 
times plus gives this plus 
ill make a substitution 
now, ill make this substitution 
you might think that i could use a 
substitution u equals rd x plus 
squared 
then, i need an x in numerator, 
right 
so instead, im going to make slowly 
different substitution, im going to 
make this looks like u squared 
so, ill set u to square 
root times x plus 
so now, this denominator looks like 
u squared plus 
in that case, whats du 
well, that means du is square 
root dx 
now, integral become 
you might concerned that you dont see 
square root dx here, 
i manufacture one 
if i make this square 
root , i put a square 
root here, without affecting 
anything 
now, ive got a du 
so, this antidifferentiation problem 
becomes square root 
anti derivative this, here, 
is u squared plus 
this square root dx, 
that is du 
thats arctan 
so, this is one square root 
antiderivative this is arctan u plus 
c 
now, i to replace that u 
value in terms x 
so, this is square root 
arctan, u here is this, so ill write 
that in here u, square 
root times x plus plus c 
now, im in a position to state a 
conclusion 
original question asking an 
antiderivative x squared plus 
x plus , we found 
square root times 
arctan, square root times 
x plus two, plus constant 
so, weve antidifferentiated this 
reciprocal this quadratic polynomial 
well, fantastic, trick works 
in situations well 
really, anytime youve handed a 
quadratic polynomial you wish youd 
given something squared plus a 
number, you try completing 
square
