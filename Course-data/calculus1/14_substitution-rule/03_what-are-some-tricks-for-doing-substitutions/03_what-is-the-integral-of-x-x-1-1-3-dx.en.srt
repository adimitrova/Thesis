[MUSIC] Generally speaking, 
anti-differentiating things with radicals 

2
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:13,381
is difficult. 
For example, let's try to find an 

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:21,390
anti-derivative of, x over the cube root 
of x plus 1 dx right? 

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,195
Let's try to anti-differentiate this. 
Can I make a substitution to improve the 

5
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:29,670
integrand? 
So what substitution do I want to make? 

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,534
Well, I really have some choices, I mean, 
one thing I could do is I could make ux 

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:41,252
plus 1 and in that case, du is just dx. 
And if u is x plus 1, then x is u minus 

8
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:47,830
1, and I can then rewrite this 
anti-differentiation problem. 

9
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:54,529
instead this becomes the anti-derivative 
of that x, but u minus 1 still cube root, 

10
00:00:54,529 --> 00:01:01,602
but instead of x plus 1, it's now of u 
and the dx becomes du. 

11
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:06,265
And I, I could actually do this, but I'm 
not going to head down that path. 

12
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:10,047
Instead, I want to show you a trick by 
which you can get rid of the radical all 

13
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:15,588
together. 
So instead let's set u, just to grab the 

14
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:22,693
whole denominator. 
So u will be the cube root of x plus 1 

15
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:33,660
and in that case, u cubed is x plus 1. 
Or, in other words, x is u cubed minus 1. 

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,580
And that tells me what dx is. 
In that case, dx is 3u squared du. 

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,618
Now I could make this substitution. 
This transforms this integration problem 

18
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:53,860
to, the anti-derivative of x now becomes 
u-cubed minus 1. 

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,140
The whole denominator just becomes u. 
And then the dx here is now a 3u squared 

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,650
du, so I'll write 3u squared du. 
And that's just a polynomial. 

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:13,964
So I'll simplify this a bit, this is the 
anti-derivative of, what is this here, u 

22
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:20,536
cubed over u times 3u squared, that's 3u 
to the 4th minus 1 over u times 3u 

23
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:30,163
squared that's minus 3u, du. 
And this, this is just a polynomial, so I 

24
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:39,069
can anti-differentiate this very quickly. 
This anti-derivative is 3 5ths u to the 

25
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:48,855
5th, minus 3 halves u squared plus C. 
Now, we'll just replace u with what it 

26
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:52,635
equals in terms of x. 
So u, remember, is the cube root of x 

27
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:57,285
plus 1, so putting that in here, I get 3 
5ths, instead of u it's x plus 1 to the 1 

28
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:04,592
3rd to the 5th. 
So to the 5 3rds power, minus 3 halves x 

29
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:14,400
plus 1 to the 1 3rd squared, which is to 
the 2 3rds power plus C. 

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,906
To make it easy to talk about this 
particular technique, it has a name. 

31
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:22,990
The rationalizing substitution. 
The original problem had a cube root in 

32
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,780
it, but I made a substitution to get rid 
of the radical, a rationalizing. 

33
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,490
A challenge when doing u substitutions is 
that there really are multiple paths that 

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,569
you can take to the correct answer. 
It's not even apparent how successful a 

35
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,140
particular substitution might be until 
after you've started applying it, right? 

36
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,440
You have to take that first bite before 
you realize whether or not you're eating 

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
food.
