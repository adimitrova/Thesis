sometimes best substitution to make 
isnt even visible until weve 
messed around integrand 

example, whats antiderivative 
plus cosine x 
dx, you 
first move might to try 
substitution u equals cosine x, 
case du is negative sine x dx, 
theres visible sine x in 
integrand 
well, since talking invisible 
substitutions, we try to mess 
around integrand 
instead that, lets try a 
different trick 
lets try to multiply plus 
cosine x minus cosine x divided 
minus cosine x 
this doesnt change integrand all, 
this is 
this trick makes a hitherto invisible 
substitution visible 
im getting ahead a little bit 
lets first apply a trig identity 
oh, this is minus cosine x in 
numerator divided by, thats minus 
cosine squared x, trig 
identity is that minus cosine squared 
x, well thats sine squared x 
so i want to antidifferentiate 
minus cosine x sine squared x dx 
well even that isnt so great 
lets split 
well i get, that this is 
antiderivative sine squared x dx 
minus antiderivative cosine x 
sine squared x dx 
that first integral is one that i 

rewrite antiderivative 
cosecant squared x 
you know, i to think, i know 
function whose derivative is cosecant 
squared 
yes, negative cotangent is an 
antiderivative cosecant squared, 
x 
that intergral 
well i could read this cotangent times 
cosecant recognize 
antiderivative that way 
to demonstrate technique i 
also apply u substitution to that 
antidifferentiation problem so lets let 
u equal sine x, in that case, du is 
cosine x dx, is great, 
thats numerator there 
so this this antidifferentiation problem 
becomes 
this is antiderivative du u 
squared 
i gotta think, i, 
antidifferentiate u to negative 
second power 
well that, is power rule plus 
u plus c 
alright, if i differentiate one u, 
that gives negative u squared 
okay, i dont want answer to in 
terms u, right, i want answer to 
in terms x 
so this is negative cotangent x plus, 
whats u, well thats sine 
x which, if i wanted to, i could write 
cosecant x plus c 
lets put together 
so im claiming here is that 
antiderivative plus cosine x 
dx is negative cotangent plus cosecant, 
plus constant 
if you already, i hope youre 
getting idea that theres really 
clever things that you try to make 
substitutions work
