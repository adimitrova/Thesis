[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:09,075
We already know how to integrate. 
And by integrate, I mean, 

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,840
anti-differentiate some fractions. 
For instance, here is an 

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,762
anti-differentiation problem. 
Let's anti-differentiate 4x plus 3 dx. 

5
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:22,567
And I can do that with a u substitution. 
we have to choose what u should be equal 

6
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,755
to. 
I'll set u equal 4x plus 3, so that du 

7
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:31,195
is, what's the derivative of this, is 
just 4, and then the differential of u is 

8
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:36,440
4dx. 
Now, I don't see a 4dx in my integrand 

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,899
here, but I can manufacture a 4dx. 
If I multiply by 1 4th and 4. 

10
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,723
That's like doing nothing, right? 
Those cancel, but now I've got a 4dx in 

11
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:53,690
my integrand. 
So, the original anti-differentiation 

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,500
problem is 1 quarter of anti-derivative 1 
over u du. 

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,016
And I know an anti-derivative 1 over u 
du. 

14
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,420
Alright? 
It's log of the absolute value of u plus 

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,816
c. 
And, I've got to make sure to include 

16
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,768
that constant on the outside of 1 
quarter. 

17
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:12,178
But I don't want to write down my answer 
in terms of u, I'd like my answer to be 

18
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:14,480
in terms of x. 
Right? 

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm asking for an anti-derivative 1 over 
4x plus 3, not somethings in terms of u. 

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,512
So, I'll just replace u with what it's 
equal to. 

21
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:34,280
So, altogether, I got 1 quarter log of 
the absolute value of 4x plus 3, plus c. 

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,831
So, there's my anti-derivative of this 
fraction. 

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:42,610
I also know how to anti-differentiate 
some reciprocals of a quadratic 

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,844
polynomials. 
At least, here's a special case what's 

25
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:50,637
the anti-derivative 1 over x squared plus 
one dx? 

26
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:55,308
Well, if you remember back, I know a 
function whose derivative is this. 

27
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:58,571
Alright. 
It's the inverse tangent function arctan. 

28
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:01,973
So, at least I know how to 
anti-differentiate the reciporical of 

29
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:07,324
this particular quadratic polynomial. 
Wonderfully, I can use that special case, 

30
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:11,292
the anti-derivative of 1 over x squared 
plus 1, to anti-differentiate the 

31
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:15,580
reciporicals of of other quadratic 
polynomials. 

32
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,303
For example, can we find an 
anti-derivative of 1 over x squared plus 

33
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:26,994
4x plus 7 dx? 
Can you think of a function whose 

34
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:31,246
derivative is this? 
I can't come off with an anti-derivative 

35
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:35,173
just off the top of my head. 
But, I've got a trick up my sleeve, the 

36
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:40,592
trick is completing the square. 
What that means is that I'm going to 

37
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:45,228
rewrite x squared plus 4x plus 7 and I 
want it to look more like the example I 

38
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:51,110
know, right? 
The example that I know is this thing. 

39
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,647
I know that the anti-derivative of 1 over 
something squared plus something. 

40
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:57,499
So, I'm just trying to rewrite this 
quadratic polynomial, so it looks more 

41
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:01,250
like that. 
So, I'm going to try to rewrite it, so it 

42
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,380
looks like x plus, you know, something 
squared plus plus something. 

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,670
The trouble is how to find the blue and 
the red somethings. 

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,622
Let's do some algebra. 
So, I'm going to write this as x plus, 

45
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:22,886
instead of just a squiggle, I'll call it 
a,squared plus some other constant b. 

46
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:31,065
And if I expand that out, what do I get? 
Well, I get x squared plus a cross term 

47
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:43,080
2ax, plus I got an a squared term. 
and then a b left over that I add on. 

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,565
So, I'm trying to make this quadratic 
polynomial look like this. 

49
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:57,081
And the only term that I've got with an x 
here is this 2a should be 4. 

50
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:01,306
Alright? 
So, let me write that down. 

51
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:06,897
So, 2a is equal to 4. 
And that tells me what a is. 

52
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:10,804
a should be 2. 
I'll finish by finding b. 

53
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:19,840
So, I've got x plus 2 squared plus some b 
is equal to x squared plus 4x plus 7. 

54
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,746
x plus 2 squared is x squared plus 4x 
plus 2 squared, which is 4, plus b, is 

55
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:35,606
suppose to be equal to this. 
And, that's tells me what b had better 

56
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:36,660
be. 
Right? 

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,256
I've got 4x and I've got an x squared, 
then I've got a 4 plus b is 7. 

58
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:46,810
Alright, so 4 plus b is 7, so b is 3. 
Let's summarize. 

59
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,716
So, what I've got here is that x squared 
plus 4x plus 7 can instead be written as 

60
00:04:54,716 --> 00:05:04,775
x plus, in this case, 2 squared plus, and 
then for b, I've got 3. 

61
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:10,760
So, I've rewritten this quadratic 
polynomial as a linear term squared plus 

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,968
some constant. 
Now, I'll use that fact in the 

63
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:20,183
integration problem. 
Right, the original integral is 1 over x 

64
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:26,856
squared plus 4x plus 7. 
And instead of doing that integral, I can 

65
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:35,660
do the integral of 1 over this equivalent 
thing, x plus 2 squared plus 3 dx. 

66
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,350
That still doesn't exactly look like the 
anti-derivative problem that resulted in 

67
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,810
arctan. 
Remember, the anti-derivative here that 

68
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:52,042
gave us arctan x has a plus one, but the 
thing we're looking at here has a plus 3. 

69
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:56,471
So, I can fix that. 
I can get a constant here. 

70
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:02,653
I can factor out something. 
I'll factor out a third and that will be 

71
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:10,942
integral of 1 over 1 over 3 times x plus 
2 squared plus 1 dx, right? 

72
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:17,032
This is the same thing as this, because 
this 3 times a third is just the 1 here 

73
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:26,110
that I haven't written. 
And 3 times plus 1 gives me this plus 3. 

74
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,222
I'll make a substitution. 
Now, I'll make this substitution. 

75
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:35,073
you might think that I could use a 
substitution where u equals 1 3rd x plus 

76
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:39,183
2 squared. 
But then, I need an x in the numerator, 

77
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:42,196
right? 
So instead, I'm going to make it slowly 

78
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:47,471
different substitution, I'm just going to 
make this looks like u squared. 

79
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:52,636
So, I'll set u to be 1 over the square 
root of 3 times x plus 2. 

80
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:57,491
So now, this denominator looks like 1 
over u squared plus 1. 

81
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:03,890
And in that case, what's du? 
Well, that means du is 1 over the square 

82
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,450
root of 3 dx. 
Now, what does the integral become? 

83
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,570
You might be concerned that you don't see 
1 over the square root of 3 dx here, but 

84
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,718
I can manufacture one of those. 
If I make this into the 1 over the square 

85
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:18,850
root of 3, I can put a 1 over the square 
root of 3 here, without affecting 

86
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,410
anything. 
And now, I've got a du. 

87
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,382
So, this anti-differentiation problem 
becomes 1 over the square root of 3. 

88
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:37,060
The anti derivative of 1 over this, here, 
is u squared plus 1. 

89
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,863
And this 1 over the square root of 3 dx, 
that is now my du. 

90
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:51,484
And that's arctan. 
So, this is one over the square root of 

91
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:55,466
3. 
Anti-derivative of this is arctan u plus 

92
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,416
c. 
Now, I just have to replace that u with 

93
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:03,488
its value in terms of x. 
So, this is 1 over the square root of 3 

94
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:09,440
arctan, and u here is this, so I'll write 
that in here for u, 1 over the square 

95
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,450
root of 3 times x plus 2 plus C. 
And now, I'm in a position to state a 

96
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,719
conclusion. 
The original question was asking for an 

97
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:29,070
anti-derivative of 1 over x squared plus 
4x plus 7, and we found it. 

98
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,228
It's 1 over the square root of 3 times 
arctan, 1 over the square root of 3 times 

99
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:38,526
x plus two, plus some constant. 
So, we've anti-differentiated this 

100
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:44,136
reciprocal of this quadratic polynomial. 
Well, fantastic, and the same trick works 

101
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:48,533
in other situations as well. 
Really, anytime you've been handed a 

102
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:52,565
quadratic polynomial but you wish you'd 
been given something squared plus a 

103
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,596
number, you should try completing the 
square.
