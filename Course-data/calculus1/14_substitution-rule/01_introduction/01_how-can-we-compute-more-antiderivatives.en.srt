2
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,988
When we first learned about definite
integrals, we

3
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:11,110
learned about them as limits of remind
sums.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,070
And in a few cases that definition was
good enough.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,400
We are able to use a complicated looking
summation formula, and take a

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,399
limit and end up evaluating a definite
integral just with our bare hands.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,030
But usually that was much too hard.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,790
So we very quickly learned about the
fundamental theorem of calculus.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:36,230
That reduced evaluating definite integrals
down to finding anti derivatives.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,740
Now it turns out that finding anti
derivatives is also really hard to do.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,810
So, at this point, what we need are some
better

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,090
techniques, or just heuristics for how to
find those anti-derivatives.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,870
And a big one is called U-substitution or
maybe the substitution rule.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,430
And what it really amounts to, is just
running the Chain Rule in reverse.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,470
And, if you think back to how many times
we're using the

16
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,270
chain rule, when we were differentiating,
we were using it all the time.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,870
Right, there was all kinds of

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,900
differentiation problems that involved the
chain rule.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,440
Well, if the chain rule appears so often
when we're differentiating,

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,800
we're going to need some way of running
that chain rule in reverse.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,726
And, that's exactly what substitution will
do for us.
