we first learned definite 
integrals, we 
learned limits remind 
sums 
in a few cases that definition 
good enough 
we able to use a complicated looking 
summation formula, take a 
limit end evaluating a definite 
integral bare hands 
usually that much hard 
so we quickly learned 
fundamental theorem calculus 
that reduced evaluating definite integrals 
to finding anti derivatives 
turns that finding anti 
derivatives is also really hard to 
so, this point, we need 
better 
techniques, heuristics to 
find antiderivatives 
a big one is called usubstitution 
maybe substitution rule 
really amounts to, is 
running chain rule in reverse 
and, if you think back to many times 
using 
chain rule, we differentiating, 
we using time 
right, there kinds 
differentiation problems that involved 
chain rule 
well, if chain rule appears so often 
differentiating, 
going to need way running 
that chain rule in reverse 
and, thats exactly substitution will 
us
