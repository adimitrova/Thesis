sometimes you might want to u 
substitution 
imagine that youve got something 
really terriblelooking, like trying to 
find an antiderivative this, negative 
cosine x sin x 
cosine, cosine squared x plus dx, 
right 
predefine an antiderivative this 
we 
you might thinking ugh, if i could 
get rid that cosine squared term 
well to that, lets say u, equaled a 
cosine x 
lets write that down, so 
substitution that im proposing, is u 
equals cosine x 
thatll good cause ive got a 
cosine x a cosine squared x here 
i also see du in this intergrand, 
right 
whats du 
well differential u 
whats derivative cosine 
minus sine, so differential, 
includes this dx, right 
du is negative sine x dx 
well lets make substitution 
lets see works 
so this, antiderivative problem is now, 
a minus sin x dx, become du 
im left a two cos x u, 
minus two sin x dx is 
going to in du, i got a cos 
sign, cos sign squared x is u squared 
plus one everything else thats left 
is in this du 
ill make another substitution 
ill make v equal u squared plus 
well lets write that 
so substitution that im proposing is 
v equals u squared plus 
thats a good choice, ive 
got a u squared plus there, i 
see that derivative this appears 
here so this will grab quite a bit 
integrant 
okay, lets site differential, 
dv in that case is derivative to you 
du so dv is u, du i write 
this antidifferentiation 
problem becomes u du ends 
dv 
ive got a cosine v 
i antidifferentiate that 
problem 
right 
antiderivative cosine v dv 
is just, sine v 
ill write plus c, right 
derivative sine v is 
cosine v respect to v, probably 
grader is going to 
impressed if i express answer 
in terms a substitution that i 
made up, right 
i shouldnt write answer in 
terms v, i writing 
answer in terms x 
remember that v is u squared 
plus , so i subsitute that in here, 
instead writing sin v plus 
c, ill write sin u squared plus 
, ill include that plus c 
da, answer is in terms u, 
original question in terms x 
lets remember u 
u cosine x so i make that final 
substitution back in here 
so instead writing sine u squared 
plus 
ill write sine cosine squared x, 
u is cosine x 
plus , plus c 
so i claiming 
original question asking an 
anti derivative this crazy expression, 
im claiming, then, is that 
anti derivative this is sign cosign 
squared x plus plus c 
so we 
i bet that you imagine truly 
terrible anti differentiation problems 
that involved substitutions within 
substitutions within substitutions 
part problem this calculus 
course, i suppose calculus courses 
generally, is that courses sort 
based this idea instructor 
providing problems to you 
heres challenge 
invent difficult antiderivative 
problems 
cooking 
antidifferentiation problems, youll gain 
insight makes 
antidifferentiation problems easy, 
makes antidifferentiation problems 
hard
