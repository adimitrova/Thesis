integrating
is
at
its
heart
a
creative
process
,
right
.
differentiating
is
just
applying
a
bunch
of
rules
carefully
but
just
applying
the
rules
.
integrating
usually
requires
some
sort
of
creative
flash
of
insight
.
for
u-substitution
in
particular
,
there
's
a
ton
of
creativity
in
picking
the
best
u.
so
if
you
're
looking
for
how
to
pick
u
,
right
,
what
should
you
make
u
equal
for
your
u
substitution
?
well
,
i
'd
look
for
things
that
you
can
grab
as
du
,
right
?
try
to
find
pieces
of
the
integrand
that
look
like
the
derivative
of
something
.
well
,
let
's
try
that
.
so
,
let
's
try
the
anti-differentiate
,
say
,
x
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
dx
.
so
i
can
see
that
x
squared
in
the
denominator
and
i
can
see
the
x
in
the
numerator
.
and
i
'm
thinking
,
ahh
,
i
put
the
x
squared
in
the
u
so
that
the
du
will
grab
the
x
in
the
numerator
.
let
's
go
!
so
i
proposed
that
u
,
should
be
4
minus
9x
squared
.
and
then
what
's
du
?
well
,
calculate
the
differential
of
u
by
taking
the
derivative
here
and
the
derivative
4
is
0.
but
derivative
negative
9x
squared
is
negative
18x
for
the
dx
.
and
now
you
're
thinking
,
oh
,
this
is
terrible
.
i
do
n't
see
a
negative
18
anywhere
in
this
problem
.
but
i
can
introduce
one
.
i
can
make
a
negative
18
there
as
long
as
i
cancel
it
with
1
over
negative
18
there
.
so
i
've
done
nothing
to
the
anti-differentiation
problem
.
i
have
n't
changed
the
problem
at
all
,
this
is
just
multiplying
by
1
,
they
cancel
.
but
i
've
now
got
a
du
in
my
integrand
.
so
,
let
's
make
that
substitution
.
this
is
now
,
well
,
the
numerator
is
now
just
du
,
and
the
denominator
is
the
square
root
of
u.
now
i
want
to
make
sure
to
include
the
1
over
negative
18
in
front
.
and
that
integral
i
can
do
with
the
power
rule
.
so
this
is
,
still
1
over
negative
18
,
and
what
's
an
anti-derivative
of
this
?
well
this
is
the
anti-derivative
of
u
to
the
negative
1
half
power
,
but
that
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
i
can
do
with
the
power
rule
,
right
,
so
this
is
1
over
negative
18.
times
by
the
power
rule
this
is
u
to
the
1
half
over
1
half
plus
c
,
which
i
could
rewrite
a
little
bit
more
nicely
,
dividing
by
1
half
is
the
same
as
multiplying
by
2
,
so
this
is
negative
1
9th
the
square
root
of
u
plus
c.
now
i
'll
rewrite
that
in
terms
of
x.
so
,
in
terms
of
x
,
this
is
,
well
remember
,
u
is
4
minus
9x
squared
,
so
this
is
negative
1
9th
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
,
is
what
u
is
,
plus
c.
so
i
found
an
anti-derivative
of
x
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
.
i
should
warn
you
here
,
something
that
makes
anti-differentiations
so
hard
is
that
similar
looking
integration
problems
can
have
totally
different
looking
answers
.
for
example
,
we
just
saw
how
to
anti-differentiate
x
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
,
we
got
this
.
how
do
we
anti-differentiate
this
very
similar
looking
function
1
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
,
the
only
difference
is
that
i
got
rid
of
the
x
and
the
numerator
.
but
that
's
a
big
difference
.
that
x
and
the
numerator
was
facilitating
the
substitution
.
i
needed
that
x
there
in
order
to
have
something
to
fit
into
the
du
.
without
that
x
there
,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
?
well
,
i
could
try
to
factor
out
2
from
the
denominator
here
.
i
mean
,
i
'm
not
going
to
make
a
substitution
yet
,
i
'm
just
going
to
try
to
rewrite
the
integrand
,
so
if
i
factor
out
a
2
this
is
the
anti-derivative
of
1
over
2
,
times
the
square
root
of
1
minus
9
over
4x
squared
dx
.
and
you
might
be
wondering
,
you
know
,
why
is
there
a
2
on
the
outside
and
a
4
on
the
inside
because
the
square
root
of
4
is
2.
my
plan
here
is
to
make
the
denominator
look
like
the
square
root
of
,
1
minus
something
squared
.
rewrite
this
,
integral
again
as
1
over
2
,
the
square
root
of
1
minus
,
and
instead
of
9
quarters
x
squared
,
i
'll
write
it
as
3
halves
x
squared
dx
.
and
now
i
'll
make
a
u-substitution
.
i
'll
say
u
equals
to
this
3
halves
x.
so
,
3
halves
x
so
that
du
is
3
halves
dx
.
and
now
you
're
going
to
complain
.
well
,
i
do
n't
see
a
3
halves
dx
.
then
,
you
do
have
a
1
half
dx
here
,
and
i
can
manufacture
a
3
here
as
long
as
i
'm
willing
to
put
a
1
3rd
on
the
outside
that
does
n't
affect
anything
.
but
now
i
've
got
a
3
dx
over
2
,
so
i
've
got
a
du
.
1
over
the
square
root
of
1
minus
u
squared
.
let
's
write
that
down
.
so
this
whole
thing
is
1
3rdthe
anti-derivative
of
1
over
the
square
root
of
1
minus
,
this
is
u
squared
,
and
3
halves
dx
is
du
.
why
is
this
a
good
idea
?
well
this
is
a
good
idea
because
this
is
now
1
3rd
,
and
i
know
something
which
differentiates
to
this
.
arc
sin
u
,
alright
,
is
the
anti-derivative
of
this
.
to
finish
this
,
i
'll
replace
u
by
3
halves
x.
so
i
get
that
this
is
1
3rd
arcsin
of
3
halves
x
plus
c.
alright
?
this
is
just
'cuz
you
is
3
halves
x.
look
at
how
different
this
experience
was
.
compared
to
that
first
integral
that
we
did
.
just
showed
that
the
anti-derivative
of
1
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
is
1
3rd
the
arcsin
of
3
halves
x
plus
c.
and
that
looks
totally
different
from
anti-differentiating
x
over
the
square
root
of
4
minus
9x
squared
,
right
?
i
did
n't
need
any
inverse
trig
functions
there
.
you
know
even
though
the
integrands
look
relatively
similar
,
right
?
i
'm
mean
i
'm
just
missing
an
x
but
it
totally
transforms
the
answer
.
picking
the
best
u
for
your
u-substitutions
really
is
an
art
form
.
this
is
why
people
have
integration
bees
just
like
they
have
spelling
bees
,
right
?
there
's
a
real
creativity
to
integrating
.
