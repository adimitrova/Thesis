00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,956
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:09,180
Sometimes you might want to do u 
substitution more than once. 

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,124
Imagine that you've got something just 
really terrible-looking, like trying to 

4
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:17,311
find an anti-derivative of this, negative 
2 cosine x sin x. 

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,027
Cosine, cosine squared x plus 1 dx, 
right? 

6
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:25,060
Predefine an anti-derivative of this. 
We can. 

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,960
You might be thinking ugh, if I could 
just get rid of that cosine squared term. 

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,050
Well to do that, let's say u, equaled a 
cosine x. 

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,914
Let's write that down, so the 
substitution that I'm proposing, is u 

10
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,792
equals cosine x. 
And that'll be good cause I've got a 

11
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,698
cosine x and a cosine squared x here and 
I can also see du in this intergrand, 

12
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:48,460
right? 
What's du? 

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,472
Well it's the differential of u. 
What's the derivative of cosine? 

14
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:56,688
It's minus sine, so the differential, 
then includes this dx, right? 

15
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,224
Du is negative sine x dx. 
Well let's make the substitution. 

16
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:05,086
Let's see how it works out. 
So this, anti-derivative problem is now, 

17
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:10,101
with a minus sin X DX, or become the DU 
but I'm left with a two cos X as U, the 

18
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:14,691
minus two and the sin X and the DX is 
going to be in the DU, but I got a cos 

19
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:20,131
sign, cos sign squared X is U squared 
plus one and everything else that's left 

20
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:29,140
over Is in this du. 
Now I'll make another substitution. 

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,540
I'll make v equal u squared plus 1. 
Well let's write that down. 

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,940
So the substitution that I'm proposing is 
v equals u squared plus 1. 

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,594
And that's a good choice, because I've 
got a U squared plus 1 there, and I can 

24
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:47,689
see that the derivative of this appears 
here so this will grab quite a bit of the 

25
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,286
integrant. 
Okay, let's site then the differential, 

26
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:58,026
DV in that case is the derivative to you 
DU so DV is 2U, DU and now I can write 

27
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:03,319
down what this anti-differentiation 
problem becomes 2u du ends up being the 

28
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:10,540
the dv. 
And I've got a cosine of just v now. 

29
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,173
Now I can anti-differentiate that no 
problem. 

30
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:19,940
Right. 
The anti-derivative of cosine v dv. 

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,386
Is just, sine v. 
I'll write plus c, right? 

32
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:27,576
because the derivative of sine v is 
cosine v with respect to v, but probably 

33
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:30,821
the grader is not going to be too 
impressed with me if I express my answer 

34
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:35,620
in terms of a substitution that I just 
made up, right? 

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,596
I shouldn't write down the answer in 
terms of v, I should be writing down the 

36
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:43,338
answer in terms of x. 
Remember from before that v is u squared 

37
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:49,058
plus 1, so I can subsitute that in here, 
and instead of writing down sin of v plus 

38
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:58,378
C, I'll write down sin of u squared plus 
1, and then I'll include that plus C. 

39
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:03,380
Da, my answer is in terms of u, but the 
original question was in terms of x. 

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,910
Let's remember what u was. 
u was cosine x so I can make that final 

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,198
substitution back in here. 
So instead of writing sine of u squared 

42
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:15,876
plus 1. 
I'll write down sine of cosine squared x, 

43
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:21,840
because u is cosine x. 
Plus 1, plus C. 

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,865
So what am I claiming? 
The original question was asking for an 

45
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:30,350
anti derivative of this crazy expression, 
and what I'm claiming, then, is that the 

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,084
anti derivative of this is sign of cosign 
squared X plus 1 plus C. 

47
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:39,288
So we did it. 
And I bet that you can imagine some truly 

48
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:43,644
terrible anti differentiation problems 
that involved substitutions within 

49
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:48,980
substitutions within substitutions. 
Part of the problem with this calculus 

50
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,665
course, I suppose with calculus courses 
generally, is that the courses are sort 

51
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:58,350
of based on this idea of the instructor 
just providing problems to you. 

52
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,950
Here's the challenge. 
Invent some difficult antiderivative 

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,684
problems for yourself. 
By cooking up your own 

54
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:12,132
antidifferentiation problems, you'll gain 
some insight into what makes 

55
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:19,412
antidifferentiation problems easy, or 
what makes antidifferentiation problems 

56
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,256
hard.
