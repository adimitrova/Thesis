[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:08,773
In order to integrate a complicated 
function, I really just want to 

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:15,671
antidifferentiate complicated functions. 
For example, can I antidifferentiate x 

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:20,869
times sin of x squared dx? 
And if you think back to when we were 

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:25,930
doing all our differentiation stuff, a 
big deal was the chain rule. 

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,120
We were always using the chain rule in 
order to differentiate things. 

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,970
So for this problem I might try to think 
in terms of the chain rule, right? 

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,680
I know some function who's derivative is 
sin, minus cosine differentiates to sin. 

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,896
But, and I want an x squared in there 
somehow, so I'll put in x squared there, 

10
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:48,400
and I'll see, is that an antiderivative 
of this? 

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,960
Well, let's try it. 
So if I differentiate this, what do I 

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,743
get? 
Well the derivative of the outside 

13
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:58,964
function is sin, evaluated the inside 
function times the derivative of the 

14
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:03,094
inside function, which in this case is 
2x. 

15
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:08,000
And I see whoops, I'm off, right? 
I didn't quite get an antiderivative. 

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,654
I'm off by this factor of 2, so I can fix 
that, I'll just divide this by 2, which 

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,482
will have the effect of dividing that by 
2, but then these 2s will cancel, and now 

18
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:21,870
I have found an antiderivative for x 
times sin of x squared. 

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,030
And yeah, that works, but it was totally 
adhoc, I mean how did I know to divide by 

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,036
2, I just guessed and fixed my guess. 
Mathematics really shouldn't be seen as 

21
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:36,245
just a series of tricks, a big part of 
mathematics is systematizing those 

22
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:42,710
tricks, finding the patterns that unify, 
trick into a tool. 

23
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,415
In this case, we really want to 
systematize applying the chain rule in 

24
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,908
reverse. 
So this process of applying the chain 

25
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:53,810
rule in reverse, goes by the name u 
substitution. 

26
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,779
It's also just called substitution, but 
I'm going to call it u substitution to 

27
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:02,323
emphasize the conventional name u. 
That I'm going to use for the inside 

28
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,767
function when we're running the chain 
rule backwards. 

29
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:09,660
This is, any how, all too abstract, let's 
just see this in action. 

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,840
So I'm trying to anti differentiate x 
times sin of x squared dx. 

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,620
And the trick here, is to give a name to 
the inside function in the chain rule, 

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm going to call that u. 
And I want the inside function to be x 

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,525
squared, so I'll say that u is x squared. 
Well then, what's du? 

34
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:36,985
Right, what's the differential of u? 
Well, du over dx is the derivative, which 

35
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:41,292
is 2x, so du is 2x dx. 
I know you might feel kind of bad, 

36
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:45,245
because well I don't really see a 2x dx, 
I only see an x dx, but this sort of 

37
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:50,080
method going to, guides us to do the 
right thing. 

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,740
I'd like to have an 2x dx so I could put 
a 2 here, as long as I'm willing to put a 

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,080
1 half on the outside. 
It's like doing nothing. 

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,428
But now I've got a 2x dx in the 
integrand, and that'll become my du. 

41
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:07,388
So this antidifferentiation problem is 
the same as sin u du, and I've got to 

42
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:12,828
make sure to include that one half on the 
outside, but now I know an antiderivative 

43
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:19,370
for sin of u, right, it's negative 
cosine. 

44
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,866
So I've got one half and then an 
anti-derivative of sin of u is negative 

45
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:31,948
cosin plus c. 
But I don't want my answer to be in terms 

46
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:37,466
of u so I rewrite this as negative one 
half cosin of u, which is x squared plus 

47
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:42,560
c. 
There's something to notice here. 

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,281
I'm using differential with the chain 
rule so that dx is playing a crucial 

49
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:49,237
role. 
You might have thought that I was just 

50
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:52,828
writing dx at the end of my integration 
problem out of habit or tradition but 

51
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:58,216
that dx is legitimately there. 
That dx is managing the substitution for 

52
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,989
us. 
Let's see why this work? 

53
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,203
Every differentiation rule has a 
corresponding anti-differentiation rule, 

54
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:08,587
right? 
Let's say that I want to 

55
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:12,568
anti-differentiate f prime of g of x 
times g prime of x. 

56
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:16,686
Well, secretly I can recognize this is 
the derivative of f of g of x with 

57
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:20,606
respect to x. 
But let's suppose that I start writing it 

58
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:25,451
down using this substitution framework. 
So I'm making a substitution u. 

59
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:32,890
Is g of x, and in that case du is the 
derivative of g dx. 

60
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,652
So this antidifferentiation problem is 
the antidifferentiation problem f prime 

61
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:44,355
of u, and this now du. 
But I know an antiderivative of a 

62
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:48,940
derivative is just the original function. 
And in this case, u is g of x, so this is 

63
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,695
f of g of x. 
I don't know, 'cuz I mean I can really 

64
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:57,659
see this working, you know the derivative 
of this composition is this, I mean it's 

65
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:03,076
just the chain rule. 
We're going to see a ton more examples of 

66
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:07,052
this technique, and we're going to see 
that the hard part boils down to 

67
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:15,321
determining what to set u equal to. 
But if you're ever wondering why does use 

68
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:23,505
substitution work, remember, it's just a 
luren neock, I mean use substition is 

69
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:31,216
luren neock, a chain rule but in reverse.
