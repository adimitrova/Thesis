in order to integrate a complicated 
function, i really want to 
antidifferentiate complicated functions 
example, i antidifferentiate x 
times sin x squared dx 
if you think back to we 
differentiation stuff, a 
big deal chain rule 
we always using chain rule in 
order to differentiate things 
so this problem i might try to think 
in terms chain rule, right 
i know function whos derivative is 
sin, minus cosine differentiates to sin 
but, i want an x squared in there 
somehow, so ill put in x squared there, 
ill see, is that an antiderivative 
this 
well, lets try 
so if i differentiate this, i 
get 
well derivative outside 
function is sin, evaluated inside 
function times derivative 
inside function, in this case is 
x 
i see whoops, im off, right 
i didnt quite get an antiderivative 
im this factor , so i fix 
that, ill divide this , 
will effect dividing that 
, will cancel, 
i found an antiderivative x 
times sin x squared 
yeah, that works, totally 
adhoc, i mean i know to divide 
, i guessed fixed guess 
mathematics really shouldnt seen 
a series tricks, a big part 
mathematics is systematizing 
tricks, finding patterns that unify, 
trick a tool 
in this case, we really want to 
systematize applying chain rule in 
reverse 
so this process applying chain 
rule in reverse, goes name u 
substitution 
also called substitution, 
im going to call u substitution to 
emphasize conventional name u 
that im going to use inside 
function running chain 
rule backwards 
this is, how, abstract, lets 
see this in action 
so im trying to anti differentiate x 
times sin x squared dx 
trick here, is to give a name to 
inside function in chain rule, 
im going to call that u 
i want inside function to x 
squared, so ill say that u is x squared 
well then, whats du 
right, whats differential u 
well, du dx is derivative, 
is x, so du is x dx 
i know you might feel kind bad, 
well i dont really see a x dx, 
i see an x dx, this sort 
method going to, guides us to 
right thing 
id like to an x dx so i could put 
a here, long im willing to put a 
half outside 
like nothing 
ive got a x dx in 
integrand, thatll become du 
so this antidifferentiation problem is 
sin u du, ive got to 
make sure to include that one half 
outside, i know an antiderivative 
sin u, right, negative 
cosine 
so ive got one half an 
antiderivative sin u is negative 
cosin plus c 
i dont want answer to in terms 
u so i rewrite this negative one 
half cosin u, is x squared plus 
c 
theres something to notice here 
im using differential chain 
rule so that dx is playing a crucial 
role 
you might thought that i 
writing dx end integration 
problem habit tradition 
that dx is legitimately there 
that dx is managing substitution 
us 
lets see this work 
every differentiation rule a 
corresponding antidifferentiation rule, 
right 
lets say that i want to 
antidifferentiate f prime g x 
times g prime x 
well, secretly i recognize this is 
derivative f g x 
respect to x 
lets suppose that i start writing 
using this substitution framework 
so im making a substitution u 
is g x, in that case du is 
derivative g dx 
so this antidifferentiation problem is 
antidifferentiation problem f prime 
u, this du 
i know an antiderivative a 
derivative is original function 
in this case, u is g x, so this is 
f g x 
i dont know, cuz i mean i really 
see this working, you know derivative 
this composition is this, i mean 
chain rule 
going to see a ton examples 
this technique, going to see 
that hard part boils to 
determining to set u equal to 
if youre ever wondering use 
substitution work, remember, a 
luren neock, i mean use substition is 
luren neock, a chain rule in reverse
