im mostly selling you idea 
usubstitution, a way to find 
antiderivatives 
antidifferentiation is a means 
to an end 
real goal, this point in 
course, is evaluating definite integrals 
well, heres an example a definite 
integral 
lets evaluate integral x times x 
squared plus to rd power dx 
x goes to 
we usubstitution 
substitution that i want to make is u 
equals x squared plus , in that case 
du, whats derivative this, is x 
dx 
thats great cuz ive got a x dx 
right there 
so, this integration problem becomes 
integral x goes to 
is integrand 
u cube du i know 
antiderivative u cube is u to 
forth i want to make sure that 
i evaluate this x equals to 

we replace u x squared plus 
so this is x squared plus to th, 

i want to evaluate 
we plug in x equals , x equals 
, take difference 
okay, well i plug in , i get 
squared plus to th 
i plug in , i get squared 
plus to th 
whats squared plus 
thats to th thats 
to th, is 
a quarter 
and, i got think whats to 
th 
well thats times 
thats minus 
and, i combine a 
single fraction, thats 
that i simplify a bit 
thats 
we 
i couldve finished this problem 
in a slightly different equivalent 
way 
lets back up, ill get rid this, 
lets suppose that i didnt go this 
path i stopped here 
problem is that endpoints in 
terms x integrand is in 
terms u 
so im going to change 
endpoints 
so instead ill see that, that 
integration problem is 
integral u cubed du 
x is equal to , u is 
x is equal to , u is squared plus , 
is 
so if i change endpoint to in term 
u, i dont to go back to x 
so i know antiderivative, 
u to th im evaluating 

in term u taking 
difference so i plug in , i 
get to th i 
plug in i get to th 
to th is squared is 

this is 
minus a quarter and, like before, 
this ends 
lets summarize two different 
approaches 
first time i went this 
problem, i found antiderivative in 
terms x, alright 
i wanted to integrate this i found an 
antidirivitive i evaluated 
b a took difference 
in second method, instead finding 
antidirivitive in terms x, i 
change endpoints to make 
endpoints in terms u 
so, i took this original problem 
making substitution u equals g 
x, i rewrote endpoints to go 
g a to g b in terms u 
i found an antiderivative f 
prime u du f u i evaluated 
that g b g a took 
difference 
end im 
calculation 
in cases im calculating, you know, 
f g b, f g b, im 
subtracting f g a, f g a, 
im setting slightly differently 
in first case im finding 
antiderivative in terms x, in 
second case, im changing bounds 
integral to in terms u
