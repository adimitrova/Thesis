integrating is heart a creative 
process, right 
differentiating is applying a bunch 
rules carefully applying 
rules 
integrating usually requires sort 
creative flash insight 
usubstitution in particular, theres 
a ton creativity in picking best 
u 
so if youre looking to pick u, 
right, you make u equal 
u substitution 
well, id look things that you 
grab du, right 
try to find pieces integrand that 
look like derivative something 
well, lets try that 
so, lets try antidifferentiate, 
say, x square root minus x 
squared dx 
so i see that x squared in 
denominator i see x in 
numerator 
im thinking, ahh, i put x 
squared in u so that du will grab 
x in numerator 
lets go 
so i proposed that u, minus 
x squared 
whats du 
well, calculate differential u 
taking derivative here 
derivative is 
derivative negative x squared is 
negative x dx 
youre thinking, oh, this is 
terrible 
i dont see a negative anywhere in 
this problem 
i introduce one 
i make a negative there long 
i cancel negative 
there 
so ive done nothing to 
antidifferentiation problem 
i havent changed problem all, 
this is multiplying , 
cancel 
ive got a du in integrand 
so, lets make that substitution 
this is now, well, numerator is 
du, denominator is 
square root u 
i want to make sure to include 
negative in front 
that integral i power 
rule 
so this is, still negative , 
whats an antiderivative this 
well this is antiderivative u to 
negative half power, that is 
exactly sort thing i 
power rule, right, so this is 
negative 
times power rule this is u to 
half half plus c, i could 
rewrite a little bit nicely, 
dividing half is 
multiplying , so this is negative 
th square root u plus c 
ill rewrite that in terms x 
so, in terms x, this is, well 
remember, u is minus x squared, so 
this is negative th square root 
minus x squared, is u is, plus c 
so i found an antiderivative x 
square root minus x squared 
i warn you here, something that 
makes antidifferentiations so hard is 
that similar looking integration problems 
totally different looking 
answers 
example, we saw to 
antidifferentiate x square root 
minus x squared, we got this 
we antidifferentiate this 
similar looking function 
square root minus x squared, 
difference is that i got rid 
x numerator 
thats a big difference 
that x numerator facilitating 
substitution 
i needed that x there in order to 
something to fit du 
without that x there, i supposed 
to 
well, i could try to factor 
denominator here 
i mean, im going to make a 
substitution yet, im going to try 
to rewrite integrand, so if i factor 
a this is antiderivative 
, times square root minus 
x squared dx 
you might wondering, you know, 
is there a outside a 
inside square root 
is 
plan here is to make denominator 
look like square root of, minus 
something squared 
rewrite this, integral , 
square root minus, instead 
quarters x squared, ill write 
halves x squared dx 
ill make a usubstitution 
ill say u equals to this halves x 
so, halves x so that du is halves dx 
youre going to complain 
well, i dont see a halves dx 
then, you a half dx here, i 
manufacture a here long im 
willing to put a rd outside 
that doesnt affect anything 
ive got a dx , so ive 
got a du 
square root minus u 
squared 
lets write that 
so this whole thing is rdthe 
antiderivative square root 
minus, this is u squared, 
halves dx is du 
is this a good idea 
well this is a good idea this is 
rd, i know something 
differentiates to this 
arc sin u, alright, is 
antiderivative this 
to finish this, ill replace u 
halves x 
so i get that this is rd arcsin 
halves x plus c 
alright 
this is cuz you is halves x 
look different this experience 

compared to that first integral that we 

showed that antiderivative 
square root minus x 
squared is rd arcsin halves x 
plus c 
that looks totally different 
antidifferentiating x square 
root minus x squared, right 
i didnt need inverse trig functions 
there 
you know even though integrands look 
relatively similar, right 
im mean im missing an x 
totally transforms answer 
picking best u 
usubstitutions really is an art form 
this is people integration bees 
like spelling bees, right 
theres a real creativity to integrating
