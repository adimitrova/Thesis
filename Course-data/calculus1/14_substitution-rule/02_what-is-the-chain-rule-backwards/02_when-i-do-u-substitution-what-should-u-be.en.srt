2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,573
Integrating is at its heart a creative 
process, right. 

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:12,437
Differentiating is just applying a bunch 
of rules carefully but just applying the 

4
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:15,998
rules. 
Integrating usually requires some sort of 

5
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:20,078
creative flash of insight. 
For u-substitution in particular, there's 

6
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:23,130
a ton of creativity in picking the best 
u. 

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,910
So if you're looking for how to pick u, 
right, what should you make u equal for 

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,623
your u substitution? 
Well, I'd look for things that you can 

9
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:34,937
grab as du, right? 
Try to find pieces of the integrand that 

10
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:38,894
look like the derivative of something. 
Well, let's try that. 

11
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:45,626
So, let's try the anti-differentiate, 
say, x over the square root of 4 minus 9x 

12
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:50,670
squared dx. 
So I can see that x squared in the 

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,610
denominator and I can see the x in the 
numerator. 

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,035
And I'm thinking, ahh, I put the x 
squared in the u so that the du will grab 

15
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:01,996
the x in the numerator. 
Let's go! 

16
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:09,180
So I proposed that u, should be 4 minus 
9x squared. 

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,622
And then what's du? 
Well, calculate the differential of u by 

18
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:18,630
taking the derivative here and the 
derivative 4 is 0. 

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,030
But derivative negative 9x squared is 
negative 18x for the dx. 

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,030
And now you're thinking, oh, this is 
terrible. 

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,340
I don't see a negative 18 anywhere in 
this problem. 

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,778
But I can introduce one. 
I can make a negative 18 there as long as 

23
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:36,668
I cancel it with 1 over negative 18 
there. 

24
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:40,850
So I've done nothing to the 
anti-differentiation problem. 

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,170
I haven't changed the problem at all, 
this is just multiplying by 1, they 

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,090
cancel. 
But I've now got a du in my integrand. 

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,038
So, let's make that substitution. 
This is now, well, the numerator is now 

28
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:59,854
just du, and the denominator is the 
square root of u. 

29
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:08,390
Now I want to make sure to include the 1 
over negative 18 in front. 

30
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,110
And that integral I can do with the power 
rule. 

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:18,946
So this is, still 1 over negative 18, and 
what's an anti-derivative of this? 

32
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:23,682
Well this is the anti-derivative of u to 
the negative 1 half power, but that is 

33
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:28,344
exactly the sort of thing I can do with 
the power rule, right, so this is 1 over 

34
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:34,760
negative 18. 
Times by the power rule this is u to the 

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,480
1 half over 1 half plus C, which I could 
rewrite a little bit more nicely, 

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,120
dividing by 1 half is the same as 
multiplying by 2, so this is negative 1 

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:53,314
9th the square root of u plus C. 
Now I'll rewrite that in terms of x. 

38
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:59,199
So, in terms of x, this is, well 
remember, u is 4 minus 9x squared, so 

39
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:10,260
this is negative 1 9th the square root of 
4 minus 9x squared, is what u is, plus C. 

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,610
So I found an anti-derivative of x over 
the square root of 4 minus 9x squared. 

41
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,900
I should warn you here, something that 
makes anti-differentiations so hard is 

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,255
that similar looking integration problems 
can have totally different looking 

43
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,855
answers. 
For example, we just saw how to 

44
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:35,328
anti-differentiate x over the square root 
of 4 minus 9x squared, we got this. 

45
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:39,423
How do we anti-differentiate this very 
similar looking function 1 over the 

46
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:43,518
square root of 4 minus 9x squared, the 
only difference is that I got rid of the 

47
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:48,360
x and the numerator. 
But that's a big difference. 

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,540
That x and the numerator was facilitating 
the substitution. 

49
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,650
I needed that x there in order to have 
something to fit into the du. 

50
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,114
Without that x there, what am I supposed 
to do? 

51
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,720
Well, I could try to factor out 2 from 
the denominator here. 

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,960
I mean, I'm not going to make a 
substitution yet, I'm just going to try 

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,400
to rewrite the integrand, so if I factor 
out a 2 this is the anti-derivative of 1 

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,906
over 2, times the square root of 1 minus 
9 over 4x squared dx. 

55
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:26,556
And you might be wondering, you know, why 
is there a 2 on the outside and a 4 on 

56
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:31,409
the inside because the square root of 4 
is 2. 

57
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,024
My plan here is to make the denominator 
look like the square root of, 1 minus 

58
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:42,483
something squared. 
Rewrite this, integral again as 1 over 2, 

59
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:49,373
the square root of 1 minus, and instead 
of 9 quarters x squared, I'll write it as 

60
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:56,100
3 halves x squared dx. 
And now I'll make a u-substitution. 

61
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:06,590
I'll say u equals to this 3 halves x. 
So, 3 halves x so that du is 3 halves dx. 

62
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,400
And now you're going to complain. 
Well, I don't see a 3 halves dx. 

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,298
Then, you do have a 1 half dx here, and I 
can manufacture a 3 here as long as I'm 

64
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:21,264
willing to put a 1 3rd on the outside 
that doesn't affect anything. 

65
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:25,036
But now I've got a 3 dx over 2, so I've 
got a du. 

66
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:28,316
1 over the square root of 1 minus u 
squared. 

67
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:33,115
Let's write that down. 
So this whole thing is 1 3rdthe 

68
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:40,738
anti-derivative of 1 over the square root 
of 1 minus, this is u squared, and 3 

69
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:47,360
halves dx is du. 
Why is this a good idea? 

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,638
Well this is a good idea because this is 
now 1 3rd, and I know something which 

71
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:56,837
differentiates to this. 
Arc sin u, alright, is the 

72
00:05:56,837 --> 00:06:02,472
anti-derivative of this. 
To finish this, I'll replace u by 3 

73
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:08,422
halves x. 
So I get that this is 1 3rd arcsin of 3 

74
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:12,910
halves x plus C. 
Alright? 

75
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,894
This is just 'cuz you is 3 halves x. 
Look at how different this experience 

76
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,795
was. 
Compared to that first integral that we 

77
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:23,005
did. 
Just showed that the anti-derivative of 1 

78
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:27,076
over the square root of 4 minus 9x 
squared is 1 3rd the arcsin of 3 halves x 

79
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:31,531
plus C. 
And that looks totally different from 

80
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:36,986
anti-differentiating x over the square 
root of 4 minus 9x squared, right? 

81
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:40,316
I didn't need any inverse trig functions 
there. 

82
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:45,170
You know even though the integrands look 
relatively similar, right? 

83
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm mean I'm just missing an x but it 
totally transforms the answer. 

84
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,720
Picking the best u for your 
u-substitutions really is an art form. 

85
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,690
This is why people have integration bees 
just like they have spelling bees, right? 

86
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:09,509
There's a real creativity to integrating.
