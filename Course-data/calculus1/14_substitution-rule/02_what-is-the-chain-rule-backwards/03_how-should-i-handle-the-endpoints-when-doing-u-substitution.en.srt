[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:09,859
I'm mostly selling you on the idea of 
u-substitution, as a way to find 

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,787
anti-derivatives. 
But anti-differentiation is just a means 

4
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,601
to an end. 
The real goal, at this point in the 

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:22,889
course, is evaluating definite integrals. 
Well, here's an example of a definite 

6
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:28,496
integral. 
Let's evaluate the integral of 2x times x 

7
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:37,156
squared plus 1 to the 3rd power dx. 
As x goes from 0 to 2. 

8
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:43,334
We can do it with u-substitution. 
The substitution that I want to make is u 

9
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:48,086
equals x squared plus 1, and in that case 
du, what's the derivative of this, is 2x 

10
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:52,640
dx. 
And that's great 'cuz I've got a 2x dx 

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,412
right there. 
So, this integration problem becomes the 

12
00:00:57,412 --> 00:01:04,160
integral x goes from 0 to 2. 
but what is the integrand now. 

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,204
It's u cube du and I know the 
anti-derivative of u cube is u to the 

14
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:18,148
forth over 4 and I want to make sure that 
I evaluate this when x equals to 0. 

15
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:22,820
And 2. 
Now we replace u by x squared plus 1. 

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,334
So this is x squared plus 1 to the 4th, 
over 4. 

17
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:35,220
And I want to evaluate at 0 and 2. 
Now we plug in x equals 2, and x equals 

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,405
0, and take the difference. 
Okay, well when I plug in 2, I get 2 

19
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:47,806
squared plus 1 to the 4th over 4. 
And when I plug in 0, I get 0 squared 

20
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:53,758
plus 1 to the 4th over 4. 
What's 2 squared plus 1? 

21
00:01:53,758 --> 00:02:00,818
That's 5 to the 4th over 4 and that's 1 
to the 4th, which is just 1. 

22
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:05,780
A quarter. 
And, now I got think about what's 5 to 

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,485
the 4th? 
Well that's 25 times 25. 

24
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:20,490
Tha'ts 625 over 4 minus 1 over 4. 
And, now I can combine these into a 

25
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,380
single fraction, that's 624 over 4. 
And that I can simplify a bit. 

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,420
That's 156. 
We did it. 

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,311
But I could've finished this problem off 
in a slightly different but equivalent 

28
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:37,961
way. 
Let's back up, I'll get rid of this, and 

29
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:44,340
let's suppose that I didn't go down this 
path but I just stopped here. 

30
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,732
The problem is that my endpoints are in 
terms of x but my integrand now is in 

31
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:52,290
terms of u. 
So I'm just going to change those 

32
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,985
endpoints. 
So instead I'll see that, that 

33
00:02:55,985 --> 00:03:03,399
integration problem is the same as the 
integral of u cubed du. 

34
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,487
And when x is equal to 0, u is 1 and when 
x is equal to 2, u is 2 squared plus 1, 

35
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:16,718
which is 5. 
So if I change the endpoint to be in term 

36
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:22,161
of u, then I don't have to go back to x. 
So again I know the anti-derivative, it's 

37
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,326
u to the 4th over 4 and I'm evaluating 
it. 

38
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:30,000
At 5 and 1 in term of u and taking the 
difference so when I plug in the 5, I 

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,424
just get 5 to the 4th over 4 and when I 
plug in 1 I just get 1 to the 4th over 4. 

40
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:42,785
And 5 to the 4th is 25 squared which is 
625 over 4. 

41
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:49,465
And this is now the same as before. 
Minus a quarter and, just like before, 

42
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:55,213
this ends up being 156. 
Let's summarize these two different 

43
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:57,678
approaches. 
The first time I went through this 

44
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:01,130
problem, I found the antiderivative in 
terms of x, alright? 

45
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,026
I wanted to integrate this and I found an 
antidirivitive and I just evaluated it at 

46
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:11,712
b and a and took the difference. 
In the second method, instead of finding 

47
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:15,240
the antidirivitive in terms of x, I 
change the endpoints to make the 

48
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,400
endpoints be in terms of u. 
So, I took this original problem and 

49
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,152
after making the substitution u equals g 
of x, then I rewrote the endpoints to go 

50
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:31,727
from g of a to g of b in terms of u. 
And then I found an antiderivative of f 

51
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:35,903
prime u du and now f of u and I evaluated 
that at g of b and g of a and took the 

52
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:40,971
difference. 
At the end of it I'm doing the same 

53
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:45,190
calculation. 
In both cases I'm calculating, you know, 

54
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,870
f of g of b, f of g of b, and I'm 
subtracting f of g of a, f of g of a, but 

55
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:59,257
I"m setting it up slightly differently. 
In the first case I'm finding the 

56
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:06,694
anti-derivative in terms of x, and in the 
second case, I'm changing the bounds on 

57
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:12,873
the integral to be in terms of u.
