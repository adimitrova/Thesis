in
order
to
integrate
a
complicated
function
,
i
really
just
want
to
antidifferentiate
complicated
functions
.
for
example
,
can
i
antidifferentiate
x
times
sin
of
x
squared
dx
?
and
if
you
think
back
to
when
we
were
doing
all
our
differentiation
stuff
,
a
big
deal
was
the
chain
rule
.
we
were
always
using
the
chain
rule
in
order
to
differentiate
things
.
so
for
this
problem
i
might
try
to
think
in
terms
of
the
chain
rule
,
right
?
i
know
some
function
who
's
derivative
is
sin
,
minus
cosine
differentiates
to
sin
.
but
,
and
i
want
an
x
squared
in
there
somehow
,
so
i
'll
put
in
x
squared
there
,
and
i
'll
see
,
is
that
an
antiderivative
of
this
?
well
,
let
's
try
it
.
so
if
i
differentiate
this
,
what
do
i
get
?
well
the
derivative
of
the
outside
function
is
sin
,
evaluated
the
inside
function
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
,
which
in
this
case
is
2x
.
and
i
see
whoops
,
i
'm
off
,
right
?
i
did
n't
quite
get
an
antiderivative
.
i
'm
off
by
this
factor
of
2
,
so
i
can
fix
that
,
i
'll
just
divide
this
by
2
,
which
will
have
the
effect
of
dividing
that
by
2
,
but
then
these
2s
will
cancel
,
and
now
i
have
found
an
antiderivative
for
x
times
sin
of
x
squared
.
and
yeah
,
that
works
,
but
it
was
totally
adhoc
,
i
mean
how
did
i
know
to
divide
by
2
,
i
just
guessed
and
fixed
my
guess
.
mathematics
really
should
n't
be
seen
as
just
a
series
of
tricks
,
a
big
part
of
mathematics
is
systematizing
those
tricks
,
finding
the
patterns
that
unify
,
trick
into
a
tool
.
in
this
case
,
we
really
want
to
systematize
applying
the
chain
rule
in
reverse
.
so
this
process
of
applying
the
chain
rule
in
reverse
,
goes
by
the
name
u
substitution
.
it
's
also
just
called
substitution
,
but
i
'm
going
to
call
it
u
substitution
to
emphasize
the
conventional
name
u.
that
i
'm
going
to
use
for
the
inside
function
when
we
're
running
the
chain
rule
backwards
.
this
is
,
any
how
,
all
too
abstract
,
let
's
just
see
this
in
action
.
so
i
'm
trying
to
anti
differentiate
x
times
sin
of
x
squared
dx
.
and
the
trick
here
,
is
to
give
a
name
to
the
inside
function
in
the
chain
rule
,
i
'm
going
to
call
that
u.
and
i
want
the
inside
function
to
be
x
squared
,
so
i
'll
say
that
u
is
x
squared
.
well
then
,
what
's
du
?
right
,
what
's
the
differential
of
u
?
well
,
du
over
dx
is
the
derivative
,
which
is
2x
,
so
du
is
2x
dx
.
i
know
you
might
feel
kind
of
bad
,
because
well
i
do
n't
really
see
a
2x
dx
,
i
only
see
an
x
dx
,
but
this
sort
of
method
going
to
,
guides
us
to
do
the
right
thing
.
i
'd
like
to
have
an
2x
dx
so
i
could
put
a
2
here
,
as
long
as
i
'm
willing
to
put
a
1
half
on
the
outside
.
it
's
like
doing
nothing
.
but
now
i
've
got
a
2x
dx
in
the
integrand
,
and
that
'll
become
my
du
.
so
this
antidifferentiation
problem
is
the
same
as
sin
u
du
,
and
i
've
got
to
make
sure
to
include
that
one
half
on
the
outside
,
but
now
i
know
an
antiderivative
for
sin
of
u
,
right
,
it
's
negative
cosine
.
so
i
've
got
one
half
and
then
an
anti-derivative
of
sin
of
u
is
negative
cosin
plus
c.
but
i
do
n't
want
my
answer
to
be
in
terms
of
u
so
i
rewrite
this
as
negative
one
half
cosin
of
u
,
which
is
x
squared
plus
c.
there
's
something
to
notice
here
.
i
'm
using
differential
with
the
chain
rule
so
that
dx
is
playing
a
crucial
role
.
you
might
have
thought
that
i
was
just
writing
dx
at
the
end
of
my
integration
problem
out
of
habit
or
tradition
but
that
dx
is
legitimately
there
.
that
dx
is
managing
the
substitution
for
us
.
let
's
see
why
this
work
?
every
differentiation
rule
has
a
corresponding
anti-differentiation
rule
,
right
?
let
's
say
that
i
want
to
anti-differentiate
f
prime
of
g
of
x
times
g
prime
of
x.
well
,
secretly
i
can
recognize
this
is
the
derivative
of
f
of
g
of
x
with
respect
to
x.
but
let
's
suppose
that
i
start
writing
it
down
using
this
substitution
framework
.
so
i
'm
making
a
substitution
u.
is
g
of
x
,
and
in
that
case
du
is
the
derivative
of
g
dx
.
so
this
antidifferentiation
problem
is
the
antidifferentiation
problem
f
prime
of
u
,
and
this
now
du
.
but
i
know
an
antiderivative
of
a
derivative
is
just
the
original
function
.
and
in
this
case
,
u
is
g
of
x
,
so
this
is
f
of
g
of
x.
i
do
n't
know
,
'cuz
i
mean
i
can
really
see
this
working
,
you
know
the
derivative
of
this
composition
is
this
,
i
mean
it
's
just
the
chain
rule
.
we
're
going
to
see
a
ton
more
examples
of
this
technique
,
and
we
're
going
to
see
that
the
hard
part
boils
down
to
determining
what
to
set
u
equal
to
.
but
if
you
're
ever
wondering
why
does
use
substitution
work
,
remember
,
it
's
just
a
luren
neock
,
i
mean
use
substition
is
luren
neock
,
a
chain
rule
but
in
reverse
.
