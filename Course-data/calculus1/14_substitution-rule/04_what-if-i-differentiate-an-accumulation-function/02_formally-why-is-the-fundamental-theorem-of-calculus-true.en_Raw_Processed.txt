music 
weve seen a bunch arguments, 
perspectives, fundamental 
theorem calculus true, 
weve also paid a high price in this 
course 
weve alot things 
rigorously, weve done squeeze 
theorem 
well squeeze theorem in hand, 
possible to give a rigorous formal 
proof fundamental theorem 
calculus 
well to remind you this is actually 
going to prove rigorously 
here 
im going to start function 
this closed interval ab to real 
numbers 
a continuous function, so 
actually integrable 
i write accumulation 
function big f takes integral 
a to x function little f 
big claim here, is that 
derivative accumulation function 
is function little f 
statement fundamental theorem 
calculus is a derivative, so 
really trying to two different 
things 
im trying to show that a limit a 
difference quotient exists, that 
derivative exists, second, im 
making a claim to value that 
derivative 
specifically, i want to show that this 
derivative, is defined to 
limit h approaches big f x 
plus h minus big f x h, i want to 
show that this is equal to little f x 
to make matters a little bit easier, 
im going to consider situation 
h is positive 
so ill put a little plus there 
lets rewrite that difference two 
accumulation functions, a single 
definite integral 
well so 
well lets write this 
so, this is limit h approaches 
right big f x plus h, 
thats integral a to x plus h 
f dt minus big f x, is 
integral a to x f dt 
h 
this difference integrals, 
written a single integral 
this is limit h approaches 
right, of, well, if i integrate 
a to x plus h subtract integral 
a to x, whats left over, is 
integral x to x plus h 
f dt h 
lets think large small 
that integral 
well, first notation 
ill define little m h to 
minimum value function f 
interval between x x plus h 
ill define big m h, to 
maximum value function little f 
interval, well interval, a 
closed interval x to x plus h 
you might wondering, i know 
that there is a minimum a maximum 
value 
well, little f assumed to continuous, so 
extreme value theorem there is a 
minimum a maximum value a closed 
interval, closed intervals 
this gives us a bound integral 
specifically lets think 
integral x to x plus h 
function little f, since function 
little f a maximum value big m 
this interval, this integral is bigger 
big m h times h 
conversely, right, minimum 
value is little m h, that means 
that this integral is least big 
little m h times h 
lets divide sides h, 
that doesnt effect inequality 
im really thinking 
case h is positive 
well that gives little m h is less 
equal to integral x to x 
plus h, f dt, h, is less 
equal to big m h 
now, we apply squeeze theorem 
well that go 
well lets think limit h 
approaches right little m 
h 
now, remember little m is, little m 
is minimum value function f 
interval between x x plus h 
h approaches right, 
this minimum value f 
value f point x 
reasoning, limit 
h approaches right 
maximum value, big m, maximum value 
f that interval is also little f 
x 
so ive got here is this inequality, 
lefthand side righthand 
side equal limit h 
approaches right, that 
means that this middle term also a 
limit that exists, equals f x 
let write that 
so i conclude, is that 
limit, h approaches right, 
integral x to x plus h, f 
dt divided h, well thats equal 
to f x 
if i play game think 
h approaching left 
i get that, that limit is also f 
x, consequently, two sided limit, 
h approaches , this term, is equal 
to f x 
so weve verified that derivative 
exist, equal to f x
