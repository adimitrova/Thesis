00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,990
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,528
We've seen a bunch of arguments, or 
perspectives, on why the fundamental 

3
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:12,124
theorem of calculus should be true, but 
we've also paid a high price in this 

4
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,270
course. 
We've been doing alot of things 

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,720
rigorously, and we've done the squeeze 
theorem. 

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,490
Well with the squeeze theorem in hand, 
it's possible to give a rigorous formal 

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,985
proof of the fundamental theorem of 
calculus. 

8
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:28,085
Well just to remind you this is actually 
what we're going to prove rigorously 

9
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:30,364
here. 
I'm going to start with some function 

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,978
from this closed interval ab to the real 
numbers. 

11
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:36,790
It's a continuous function, so it's 
actually integrable. 

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,820
then I write down the accumulation 
function big F which takes the integral 

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,398
from a to x of the function little f. 
And the big claim here, is that the 

14
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:51,300
derivative of the accumulation function 
is the function little f. 

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,336
The statement of the fundamental theorem 
of calculus is about a derivative, so 

16
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:57,170
we're really trying to do two different 
things. 

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,890
I'm trying to show that a limit of a 
difference quotient exists, that the 

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,858
derivative exists, and then second, I'm 
making a claim as to the value of that 

19
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:10,734
derivative. 
specifically, I want to show that this 

20
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:16,374
derivative, which is defined to be the 
limit as h approaches 0 of big F of x 

21
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:27,050
plus h minus big F of x over h, I want to 
show that this is equal to little f of x. 

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,869
But to make matters a little bit easier, 
I'm only going to consider the situation 

23
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,550
when h is positive. 
So I'll put a little plus there. 

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,138
Let's rewrite that difference of two 
accumulation functions, as a single 

25
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:42,270
definite integral. 
Well how so? 

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,997
Well let's just write this down. 
So, this is the limit as h approaches 0 

27
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:53,310
from the right of big F of x plus h, 
that's the integral from a to x plus h of 

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,302
f of t dt minus big F of x, which is the 
integral from a to x of f of t dt all 

29
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:08,665
over h. 
But now this difference of integrals, can 

30
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:14,696
be written as a single integral. 
This is the limit as h approaches 0 from 

31
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:20,328
the right, of, well, if I integrate from 
a to x plus h and subtract the integral 

32
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:28,960
from a to x, what's left over, is the 
integral from x to x plus h. 

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,344
Of f of t dt all over h. 
Let's think about how large and how small 

34
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:39,350
that integral can be. 
Well, first some notation. 

35
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,078
I'll define little m of h to be the 
minimum value of the function f on the 

36
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:55,058
interval between x and x plus h. 
And I'll define big M of h, to be the 

37
00:02:55,058 --> 00:03:02,830
maximum value of the function little f on 
the interval, well the same interval, a 

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:11,477
closed interval from x to x plus h. 
Now you might be wondering, how do I know 

39
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:14,150
that there is a minimum and a maximum 
value? 

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,836
Well, little f assumed to continuous, so 
by the extreme value theorem there is a 

41
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:25,770
minimum and a maximum value on a closed 
interval, and these are closed intervals. 

42
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,215
This gives us a bound on the integral. 
Specifically let's think about the 

43
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:36,400
integral from x to x plus h of the 
function little f, and since the function 

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,520
little f has a maximum value of big M on 
this interval, this integral is no bigger 

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:51,924
than big M of h times h. 
And conversely, all right, the minimum 

46
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:58,000
value is little m of h, and that means 
that this integral is at least as big as 

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,440
little m of h times h. 
Now let's divide both sides by h, and 

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,220
that doesn't effect the inequality 
because I'm only really thinking about 

49
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,612
the case when h is positive. 
Well that gives me little m of h is less 

50
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:21,220
than or equal to the integral from x to x 
plus h, of f of t dt, over h, is less 

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:30,744
than or equal to big M of h. 
Now, we apply the squeeze theorem. 

52
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:34,940
Well how does that go? 
Well let's think about the limit as h 

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,282
approaches 0 from the right of little m 
of h. 

54
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:43,308
Now, remember what little m is, little m 
is the minimum value of the function f on 

55
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:49,060
the interval between x and x plus h. 
And as h approaches 0 from the right, 

56
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,906
this minimum value of f It's just the 
value of f at the point x. 

57
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:59,928
And for the same reasoning, the limit as 
h approaches 0 from the right of the 

58
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:05,193
maximum value, big M, the maximum value 
of f on that interval is also little f of 

59
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:11,484
x. 
So what I've got here is this inequality, 

60
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:16,344
and the left-hand side and the right-hand 
side both have equal limit as h 

61
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:21,366
approaches 0 from the right, and that 
means that this middle term also has a 

62
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:28,691
limit that exists, and equals f of x. 
Let me write that down. 

63
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:34,486
So what I can conclude, is that the 
limit, as h approaches 0 from the right, 

64
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:40,281
of the integral from x to x plus h, of f 
of t dt divided by h, well that's equal 

65
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:46,494
to f of x. 
And if I play the same game but think 

66
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:53,320
about h approaching 0 from the left. 
I can get that, that limit is also f of 

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:01,412
x, and consequently, the two sided limit, 
as h approaches 0, of this term, is equal 

68
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:09,431
to f of x. 
And so we've verified that the derivative 

69
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:13,487
exist, and it's equal to f of x.
