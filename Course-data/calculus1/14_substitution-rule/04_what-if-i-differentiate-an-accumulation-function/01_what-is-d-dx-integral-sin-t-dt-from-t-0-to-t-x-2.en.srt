[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:08,934
We've already seen how the chain rule can 
help us find the anti-derivatives. 

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,913
Alright, that message is called u 
substitution. 

4
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:16,488
I'm going to do more messing around with 
the chain rule and integration. 

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:21,032
In particular, let's see what we can do 
with the chain rule, and the end points 

6
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:25,647
of integration. 
Well here's an example to play around 

7
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:32,440
with, if I take the integral from 0 to x, 
of sine of t dt, well that's something. 

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,460
But let's think about the derivative of 
this with respect to x. 

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,850
And by the fundamental theorem of 
calculus this is sine of x. 

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,630
The fundamental theorem of calculus is 
the derivative of the accumulation 

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,159
function is the integrand. 
What if that upper endpoint were a 

12
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,695
function of x? 
What I'm asking is what if this endpoint 

13
00:00:53,695 --> 00:01:00,040
weren't x anymore? 
But some function g of x right? 

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,000
Then this wouldn't be sine of x anymore, 
be something else. 

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,870
So to analyze this let's define a 
function f. 

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,620
So that function will be given by this 
rule. 

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:19,590
f of x is the integral from 0 to x of 
sine t dt. 

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,744
Now what would it mean if we replace that 
right hand endpoint instead of being x if 

19
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:28,908
we replace that with g of x? 
That would mean that I want to think 

20
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:33,214
about f of g of x, right? 
What's f of g of x? 

21
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:41,910
So, that's the integral from 0 to g of x, 
of sine t dt. 

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,676
And specifically, right, what I want to 
know, is what's the derivative with 

23
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:53,071
respect x of f of g of x. 
That's just the chain-rule. 

24
00:01:53,071 --> 00:02:00,744
So let me just write down the chain rule. 
The derivative of f of g of x is the 

25
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:07,280
derivative of f at g of x times the 
derivative of g. 

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
So what does it mean in this specific 
case? 

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,704
Remember in this case, f of x is the 
integral from 0 to x of sine t dt. 

28
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:24,917
So the derivative of f, by the 
fundamental theorem is sin of x and that 

29
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:32,002
means that the derivative of f of g of x, 
well that's just sin the derivative of f 

30
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:42,596
at g of x times the derivative of g. 
Let's make it even more concrete. 

31
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,660
Let's say that g is the squaring 
function. 

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,192
Let me write that down. 
So if I'm making g the squaring function, 

33
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:59,570
then the derivative of g is just 2x and 
in that case the derivative of f of g of 

34
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:11,498
x is sine of g which is x squared times 
the derivative of g which is 2x. 

35
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:15,990
So let's write down our final answer in 
this specific case. 

36
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,219
The final claim is that the derivative of 
the integral from 0 to g of x which in 

37
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:29,737
this case is x squared of sine t dt. 
This is the derivative with respect to x 

38
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:36,587
of f of g of x. 
This is sin of x squared times 2x and 

39
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:45,329
this statement, we can get by combining 
the chain rule and the fundamental 

40
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:51,333
theorem of calculus.
