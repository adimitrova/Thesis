ive mostly selling you idea 
usubstitution a method finding 
antiderivatives, evaluating 
indefinite integrals 
lets think usubstitution 
says definite integrals 
so heres setup 
ive got integral x goes a to b 
function f, derivative 
f, f g x times g prime x dx 
now, could i approach a problem like 
this so i make a substitution 
u equals g x so that du is g prime 
x dx and, in that case, this integration 
problem becomes integral f u u 
is g x times this is du 
ive gotta change bounds 
integration 
is x is equal to a, u is g a, 
x is equal to b, u is g b 
assuming that two integrals exist 
to justify equalty two 
integrals 
chain rule 
fundamental theorem calculus 
yet, this statement, equality 
this integral this integral, thats 
a statement two definite 
integrals 
i dont need to know fundamental 
theorem calculus in order to make this 
assertion 
this raises a fascinating question, u 
substitution is making a claim 
definite integrals 
yet naive way to justify that 
claim goes fundamental 
theorem calculus chain rule 
is possible to see statement 
u substitution definite 
integral true without resorting 
back to antidifferentiation 
well, to gain insight this, 
heres a random graph that i made 
function thats nearly constant 
function im calling f 
this, area, in here is interval 
to f udu 
thats this area in here 
i want to imagine happens i 
substitution 
happens i replace 
u x squared plus , that changes 
du, right 
thats that formula that we saw a moment 
ago 
if im integrating f u du, i could 
alternatively integrate f g x times 
du g prime xdx, i imagine that 
in graph, transforming u 
coordinates to x coordinates 
well ucoordinates stretched 
out, right 
x is , u is 
x is , u is 
is x is , u is 
x is , u is 
so if i redraw this picture in the, 
xcoordinates, if ive taken this 
picture squished in, right, 
i squish in 
im going to get a picture like 
this 
to calculate area, there, id 
calculating this integral 
integral to , this is x, f 
u is equal to in terms x, du, 
is x dx 
whole gimmick here is that 
im trading width in this picture 
height in this picture 
factor that relates width 
here, dus height here, well 
thats exactly this factor here, right 
thats du written in terms dx
