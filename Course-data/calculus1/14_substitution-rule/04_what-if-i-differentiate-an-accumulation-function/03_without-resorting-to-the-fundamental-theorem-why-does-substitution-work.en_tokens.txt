i
've
mostly
been
selling
you
on
the
idea
of
u-substitution
as
a
method
for
finding
antiderivatives
,
for
evaluating
indefinite
integrals
.
let
's
think
about
what
u-substitution
says
just
for
definite
integrals
.
so
here
's
the
setup
.
i
've
got
the
integral
x
goes
from
a
to
b
of
some
function
f
,
not
the
derivative
of
f
,
just
f
g
of
x
times
g
prime
of
x
dx
.
now
,
how
could
i
approach
a
problem
like
this
so
i
can
make
a
substitution
?
u
equals
g
of
x
so
that
du
is
g
prime
of
x
dx
and
,
in
that
case
,
this
integration
problem
becomes
the
integral
of
f
of
u
u
is
g
of
x
times
this
is
du
.
but
now
i
've
got
ta
change
the
bounds
of
integration
.
when
is
x
is
equal
to
a
,
u
is
g
of
a
,
and
when
x
is
equal
to
b
,
u
is
g
of
b.
assuming
that
those
two
integrals
exist
to
justify
the
equalty
of
those
two
integrals
.
it
's
just
the
chain
rule
and
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
.
and
yet
,
this
statement
,
the
equality
of
this
integral
and
this
integral
,
that
's
just
a
statement
about
two
definite
integrals
.
i
do
n't
need
to
know
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
in
order
to
make
this
assertion
.
this
raises
a
fascinating
question
,
u
substitution
is
making
a
claim
about
definite
integrals
.
and
yet
the
naive
way
to
justify
that
claim
goes
through
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus
and
the
chain
rule
.
is
it
possible
to
see
why
the
statement
about
u
substitution
for
definite
integral
should
be
true
without
resorting
back
to
anti-differentiation
?
well
,
to
gain
some
insight
into
this
,
here
's
a
random
graph
that
i
made
of
some
function
that
's
nearly
constant
.
but
the
function
i
'm
calling
f.
and
this
,
area
,
in
here
is
the
interval
from
1
to
10
of
f
of
udu
.
and
that
's
this
area
in
here
.
now
i
want
to
imagine
what
happens
when
i
do
the
substitution
.
what
happens
when
i
replace
.
u
with
x
squared
plus
1
,
and
that
changes
du
,
right
.
that
's
that
formula
that
we
saw
a
moment
ago
.
if
i
'm
integrating
f
of
u
du
,
i
could
alternatively
integrate
f
of
g
of
x
times
du
g
prime
of
xdx
,
and
i
can
imagine
that
in
the
graph
,
transforming
from
the
u
coordinates
to
these
x
coordinates
.
well
the
u-coordinates
are
more
stretched
out
,
right
.
when
x
is
0
,
u
is
1.
when
x
is
1
,
u
is
2.
when
is
x
is
2
,
u
is
5.
and
when
x
is
3
,
u
is
10.
so
if
i
redraw
this
picture
in
the
,
x-coordinates
,
it
's
as
if
i
've
taken
this
picture
and
squished
it
in
,
right
,
and
when
i
squish
it
in
.
then
i
'm
going
to
get
a
picture
more
like
this
.
and
to
calculate
the
area
,
there
,
i
'd
be
calculating
this
integral
.
the
integral
from
0
to
3
,
this
is
x
,
of
f
of
what
u
is
equal
to
in
terms
of
x
,
du
,
which
is
2x
dx
.
and
the
whole
gimmick
here
is
just
that
i
'm
trading
the
width
in
this
picture
for
the
height
in
this
picture
.
and
the
factor
that
relates
the
width
here
,
the
du
's
and
the
height
here
,
well
that
's
exactly
this
factor
here
,
right
?
that
's
du
but
written
in
terms
of
dx
.
