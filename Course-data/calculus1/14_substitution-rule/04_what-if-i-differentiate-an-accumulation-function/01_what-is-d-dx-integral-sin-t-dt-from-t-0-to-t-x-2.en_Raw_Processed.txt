weve already seen chain rule 
help us find antiderivatives 
alright, that message is called u 
substitution 
im going to messing around 
chain rule integration 
in particular, lets see we 
chain rule, end points 
integration 
well heres an example to play around 
with, if i take integral to x, 
sine dt, well thats something 
lets think derivative 
this respect to x 
fundamental theorem 
calculus this is sine x 
fundamental theorem calculus is 
derivative accumulation 
function is integrand 
if that upper endpoint a 
function x 
im asking is if this endpoint 
werent x anymore 
function g x right 
this wouldnt sine x anymore, 
something else 
so to analyze this lets define a 
function f 
so that function will given this 
rule 
f x is integral to x 
sine dt 
would mean if we replace that 
right hand endpoint instead x if 
we replace that g x 
that would mean that i want to think 
f g x, right 
whats f g x 
so, thats integral to g x, 
sine dt 
specifically, right, i want to 
know, is whats derivative 
respect x f g x 
thats chainrule 
so let write chain rule 
derivative f g x is 
derivative f g x times 
derivative g 
so mean in this specific 
case 
remember in this case, f x is 
integral to x sine dt 
so derivative f, 
fundamental theorem is sin x that 
means that derivative f g x, 
well thats sin derivative f 
g x times derivative g 
lets make even concrete 
lets say that g is squaring 
function 
let write that 
so if im making g squaring function, 
derivative g is x 
in that case derivative f g 
x is sine g is x squared times 
derivative g is x 
so lets write final answer in 
this specific case 
final claim is that derivative 
integral to g x in 
this case is x squared sine dt 
this is derivative respect to x 
f g x 
this is sin x squared times x 
this statement, we get combining 
chain rule fundamental 
theorem calculus
