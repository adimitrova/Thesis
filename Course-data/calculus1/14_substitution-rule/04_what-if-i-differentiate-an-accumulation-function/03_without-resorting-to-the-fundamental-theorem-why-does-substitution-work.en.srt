[MUSIC].

00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:10,401
I've mostly been selling you on the idea 
of u-substitution as a method for finding 

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:15,905
antiderivatives, for evaluating 
indefinite integrals. 

4
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:20,312
Let's think about what u-substitution 
says just for definite integrals. 

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:25,381
So here's the setup. 
I've got the integral x goes from a to b 

6
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:35,848
of some function f, not the derivative of 
f, just f g of x times g prime of x dx. 

7
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:39,490
Now, how could I approach a problem like 
this so I can make a substitution? 

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:46,682
U equals g of x so that du is g prime of 
x dx and, in that case, this integration 

9
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:57,421
problem becomes the integral of f of u u 
is g of x times this is du. 

10
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,774
But now I've gotta change the bounds of 
integration. 

11
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:10,760
When is x is equal to a, u is g of a, and 
when x is equal to b, u is g of b. 

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,855
Assuming that those two integrals exist 
to justify the equalty of those two 

13
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:18,324
integrals. 
It's just the chain rule and the 

14
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:22,324
fundamental theorem of calculus. 
And yet, this statement, the equality of 

15
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:25,844
this integral and this integral, that's 
just a statement about two definite 

16
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:29,020
integrals. 
I don't need to know the fundamental 

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,290
theorem of calculus in order to make this 
assertion. 

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,385
This raises a fascinating question, u 
substitution is making a claim about 

19
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:40,430
definite integrals. 
And yet the naive way to justify that 

20
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,950
claim goes through the fundamental 
theorem of calculus and the chain rule. 

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,464
Is it possible to see why the statement 
about u substitution for definite 

22
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:55,850
integral should be true without resorting 
back to anti-differentiation? 

23
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,330
Well, to gain some insight into this, 
here's a random graph that I made of some 

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,930
function that's nearly constant. 
But the function I'm calling f. 

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,730
And this, area, in here is the interval 
from 1 to 10 of f of udu. 

26
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,442
And that's this area in here. 
Now I want to imagine what happens when I 

27
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:17,102
do the substitution. 
What happens when I replace. 

28
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:21,880
U with x squared plus 1, and that changes 
du, right. 

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,762
That's that formula that we saw a moment 
ago. 

30
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:29,865
If I'm integrating f of u du, I could 
alternatively integrate f of g of x times 

31
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:34,968
du g prime of xdx, and I can imagine that 
in the graph, transforming from the u 

32
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:42,670
coordinates to these x coordinates. 
Well the u-coordinates are more stretched 

33
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,320
out, right. 
When x is 0, u is 1. 

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,960
When x is 1, u is 2. 
When is x is 2, u is 5. 

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,146
And when x is 3, u is 10. 
So if I redraw this picture in the, 

36
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:59,774
x-coordinates, it's as if I've taken this 
picture and squished it in, right, and 

37
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:05,768
when I squish it in. 
Then I'm going to get a picture more like 

38
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,923
this. 
And to calculate the area, there, I'd be 

39
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:13,426
calculating this integral. 
The integral from 0 to 3, this is x, of f 

40
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,858
of what u is equal to in terms of x, du, 
which is 2x dx. 

41
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:24,392
And the whole gimmick here is just that 
I'm trading the width in this picture for 

42
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:30,901
the height in this picture. 
And the factor that relates the width 

43
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:37,100
here, the du's and the height here, well 
that's exactly this factor here, right? 

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:47,644
That's du but written in terms of dx.
