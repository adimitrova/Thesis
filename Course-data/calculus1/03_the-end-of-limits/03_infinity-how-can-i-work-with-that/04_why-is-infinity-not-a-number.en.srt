1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
[SOUND] Infinity is not a number like 
seventeen. 

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,594
Don't treat it as a number. 
Let, let me show you something that 

3
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:11,485
people do all of the time. 
Here it is. 

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:17,891
People write down the interval from zero 
to infinity including zero, which is fine 

5
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:21,095
but including infinity, which is not 
okay. 

6
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:25,939
Infinity's not a number. 
What people should be writing down is 

7
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,465
this. 
The interval from zero to infinity 

8
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:31,027
including zero but not including 
infinity. 

9
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:34,993
Because infinity's not a number. 
Why am I freaking out about this? 

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,081
What's so bad about thinking of infinity 
as if it were some number? 

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:43,778
Now, if you start trying to do arithmetic 
with infinity, you're liable to walk 

12
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:47,704
straight into a trap. 
Let me demonstrate for you by walking 

13
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:52,437
into one of these traps myself. 
Let's treat infinity as if it were a 

14
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:55,569
number. 
Well, what's infinity plus one in that 

15
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:58,631
case? 
I got infinitely many things and I add 

16
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:02,180
one more. 
That's the same as having infinitely many 

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,964
things. 
So, infinity plus one would equal 

18
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,887
infinity. 
Now, what else would I know about 

19
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:12,133
infinity as a number? 
Well, what would infinity minus infinity 

20
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,473
be equal to? 
This would be a number minus itself, 

21
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:19,460
and a number minus itself is zero. 
So, you're going to treat infinity as a 

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,395
number, 
you're going to be believing these two 

23
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,645
statements. 
You're going to believe infinity plus one 

24
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:27,155
is infinity and you're going to believe 
infinity minus infinity is equal to zero. 

25
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:32,700
This is how these numbers would work. 
This is actually very bad. 

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,448
Let's just look at infinity plus one 
minus infinity, and let's subtract 

27
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:43,139
infinity from both sides. 
And you said infinity minus infinity is 

28
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:46,970
equal to zero. 
But, what's infinity plus one minus 

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,514
infinity? 
Well, that would be infinity minus 

30
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,472
infinity plus one. 
Infinity minus infinity is zero. 

31
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:55,490
This would be zero plus one. 
That side would be one. 

32
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,544
So, if you're going to treat infinity 
like a number, you're going to end up 

33
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:02,616
telling me that one equals zero. 
That's ridiculous. 

34
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:06,425
The upshot here is that you can't do 
arithmetic with infinity. 

35
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:11,033
Infinity's not a number like seventeen. 
But something comes to save the day. 

36
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,876
We can do limits. 
For instance, 

37
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:17,238
consider this problem where I'm doing a 
calculation involving infinity. 

38
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:21,723
But instead of working with infinity 
directly, I'm phrasing it as a limit 

39
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:25,041
question. 
What's the limit of x * x - 1 as x 

40
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:30,020
approaches infinity? 
Well, x is as large as I like. 

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,727
By making x big enough, I can make x as 
big as I like. 

42
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:42,879
x - 1 is also as large as I like, by 
making x big enough, I can make x - 1 as 

43
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,267
big as I like. 
And what happens if I multiply together 

44
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:53,887
two numbers which are as large as I like? 
Well, the product of two numbers that are 

45
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:58,078
as big as I want them to be can be as big 
as I want them to be. 

46
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:03,201
So, in that sense, the limit of x * x - 1 
as x approaches infinity is equal to 

47
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:06,336
infinity. 
So, what about our original example? 

48
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,724
What's infinity minus infinity? 
[LAUGH] Well, it depends. 

49
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:14,282
Here's one possibility. 
Let's consider the limit of x^2 - x as x 

50
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:17,732
approaches infinity. 
Now, this is a limit of a difference. 

51
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:22,660
You might remember back, the limit of a 
difference is a difference of the limits 

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,848
provided the limits exist. 
Ignoring that last part about whether the 

53
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,928
limits exist, 
[LAUGH] you might just blindly start 

54
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:35,288
writing down the limit as x approaches 
infinity of x^2 minus the limit of x as x 

55
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,420
approaches infinity. 
This is no good, 

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,952
right? 
The limit of x^2 as x approaches 

57
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:43,835
infinity, that's equal to infinity. 
And the limit of x as x approaches 

58
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,580
infinity, that's infinity, 
right? 

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,900
I can make x^2 as large as I like if x is 
big enough, 

60
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,995
and I can make x as large as I like if x 
is big enough. 

61
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:55,540
So, what just happened? 
I'm running the limit of a difference as 

62
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,804
the difference of the limits, but these 
limits don't exist, 

63
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,618
right? 
They're equal to infinity and infinity is 

64
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,180
not a number. 
Now, I'm left with infinity minus 

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,343
infinity. 
I don't know what to do, right? 

66
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:10,336
Who knows what that's equal to? 
That's exactly the sort of thing I'm not 

67
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,997
permitted to think about. 
Instead, if I wanted to know the limit of 

68
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:19,155
x^2 - x as x approaches infinity, I could 
rewrite this limit as the limit as x goes 

69
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:22,650
to infinity of, 
what's another way of writing x^2 - x? 

70
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,753
Could write it as x * x - 1. 
And we saw just a minute ago that the 

71
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:32,784
limit of x * x - 1 as x approaches 
infinity is equal to infinity. 

72
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:37,168
So, in this case, it seems that infinity 
minus infinity is infinity. 

73
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:41,193
On the other hand, infinity minus 
infinity could be seventeen. 

74
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:44,004
Let's see how. 
Here again, I've got a limit of a 

75
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:47,395
difference of two things. 
Something minus something as x approaches 

76
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:50,129
infinity. 
Now, if I blindly just apply the limit of 

77
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,395
a difference as the difference of limits 
without remembering that that's only 

78
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,020
valid if the limits exist, let's see what 
happens. 

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,877
And then, I get the limit as x approaches 
infinity of the first thing, which is x + 

80
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:07,150
17, minus the limit of the second thing 
which is just x. 

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,868
Now, what's the limit of x + 17 as x 
approaches infinity. 

82
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:15,432
Well, I can make x + 17 as large as I 
like if x is big enough, so that's 

83
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:17,999
infinity. 
And what's the limit of x as x approaches 

84
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,401
infinity? 
Well, I can make x as large as I like if 

85
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:24,225
x is big enough, so that's also infinity. 
So I've again walked into the trap of 

86
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:27,593
writing down infinity minus infinity, 
right? I applied the limit of a 

87
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:32,136
difference equals the difference of the 
limits without remembering that that's 

88
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:36,163
only valid if the limits exist. 
And in this case, the limits only exist 

89
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:39,901
in the weak sense that I can write down 
that they equal infinity. 

90
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:43,640
Anyway, I don't want do that. 
Now, how could I figure out what this 

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,919
limit's equal to? 
Well, this is a limit of something and I 

92
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,932
could rearrange the something, 
right? 

93
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,095
This is the same as the limit as x 
approaches infinity. 

94
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,029
What's another way of writing this? 
x + 17 - x, 

95
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:01,090
I could have just written seventeen. 
Now, what the limit of seventeen is as x 

96
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,875
approaches infinity? 
Well, what the limit of seventeen as x 

97
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:11,763
approaches anything at all? 
That's just seventeen. 

98
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:19,643
So, in this admittedly contrived case, 
infinity minus infinity ended up equaling 

99
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:21,439
seventeen. 
[SOUND]
