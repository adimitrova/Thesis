sound heres an application 
intermediate value theorem im fond 

heres goes 
suppose youve got a function f 
f is continuous in closed interval 
between zero one 
whenever x is between zero one, f 
x is between zero one 
so thats youve got to suppose 
you get this 
then, there is a point x, x between zero 
one, f x x 
telling you that there exists an 
input 
so that if you apply f to that input 
value, you get output is 
thing you plugged in 
you call things fixed points 
you imagine that f is moving around 
points between zero one, 
youre finding a point x 
doesnt move a fixed point 
is something like this true 
lets see 
let use intermediate value theorem 
im going to apply 
intermediate value theorem to f im 
going to make a new function gx 
fx x 
i know g 
gs continuous 
f is continuous assumption 
identity function x is continuous 
differences continuous functions 
continuous 
so, g is a continuous function 
closed interval 
i also know values g 
whats g zero 
well, g is definition f 
f is between zero one 
so ive got a number between zero one 
minus zero, 
that numbers least zero 
i also know something g 
g is definition f f is 
between zero one, could zero, 
could one 
but, a number between zero one minus 
one is less equal to zero 
i know altogether 
ive got a continuous function g, 
value zero is bigger equal to 
zero 
value one is less equal to 
zero 
intermediate value theorem, this 
gives a point x so that gx 
i care finding a point x so 
that gx is equal to zero 
well, if i take a look gx is 
equal to, gx is fx x 
so, i found a point x so that fx x is 
equal to zero 
i found a point x so that fx x, i 
found fixed point 
so, weve seen this is true 
letd try to apply this to a specific 
example life fx equals cosine x 
now, here ive got a graph cosine 
that graph y equals cosine x 
now, i know cosine 
i know cosines continuous cosine 
a number between zero one is a number 
between zero one 
so, statement applies to 
theres a fixed point cosine 
theres value x between zero 
one so cosine x equals x 
lets see if we find that a 
computer 
okay 
ive got cosine loaded to 
computer 
cosine one is 
let decrease input 
i notice that cosine is 
here input is smaller 
output 
let increase input 
now, notice happened 
input is output is 
smaller 
cosine is 
now, decreased input 
oh, opposite thing happened 
input is smaller output 
now, ill increase input 
ill decrease input 
increase input 
you see that i, i sort 
zoom in narrow in correct value 
x so that cosine x is equal to 
x 
sees in computer i found that this 
point here is 
so, without a number between zero 
one, cosine that number is 
a fixed point cosine 
kinds fixed point theorem 
statements that assert existence 
fixed points, 
pervade mathematics 
heres another example 
ive got a map ohio right here 
let apply a continuous function to 
this map 
sound im going to throw to 
ground, 
stomp 
lets take a look 
sound question is, is there a point 
map is exactly 
corresponding point in ground 
indeed there is 
ill use this pin to stab that 
point 
sound
