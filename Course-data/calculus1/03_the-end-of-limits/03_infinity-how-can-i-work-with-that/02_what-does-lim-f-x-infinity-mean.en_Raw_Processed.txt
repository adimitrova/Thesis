people thought, people wondered 
infinity thousands years 
going to continue that tradition 
thinking infinity, going 
to focus in one specific instance 
infinity in mathematics 
mean to say that limit 
a function equals infinity 
heres means 
limit f x, x approaches a 
equals infinity means that f x is 
large you like 
provided x is close enough to a 
a bit a warning, im saying 
that this number limit f x, x 
approaches a is equal to this number, 
infinity is a number 
i here is attaching a 
precise meaning to entire statement 
that limit f x is infinity 
so, thats means precisely, 
mean practically 
lets go to board 
this is an example, 
limit one x squared x 
approaches zero 
this limit is equal to a number 
one x squared is getting close 
to a number x is approaches zero 
one x squared is big i 
want to if im willing to put x 
close to zero 
instance, if x is within a th 
zero, happens 
well to say x is within a th zero 
is to say that x is between minus 

now, x is also non zero here i 
dont want to divide zero 
so ive got a non zero number within a 
th zero 
that mean x squared 
sound 
well that means that x squared is, 
bigger zero if i square 
non zero number, positive 
less than, sound a millionth 
so if i take a number within a thousandth 
zero i square it, that within 
a millionth zero 
sound that mean one 
x squared 
well if x squared is within a millionth 
zero, one x squared is 
bigger, sound a million 
happened, right 
i made one x squared large 
making x close enough equal to 
zero 
theres nothing particularly special 
numbers 
if i wanted one x squared to 
bigger a trillion, i would need 
x to within a millionth zero 
this example is maybe 
complicated ive got 
explicit numbers in here 
maybe this formula is complicated 
enough to, to really get a sense 
whats going 
lets look a slightly complicated 
function 
so whats limit x plus two x 
squared minus x plus one x approaches 
one 
this is a limit a quotient 
so first temptation is to think 
limit a quotient quotients 
limits 
whats limit denominator 
denominator is a polynomial 
polynomials continuous 
so i evaluate limit 
denominator plugging in one 
if i plug in one, i get one minus two 
plus one 
thats zero 
limit denominator is zero 
so i cant simply say that limit 
quotient is quotient 
limits in this case 
limit denominator is 
zero 
that limit law apply in this 
case 
i going to 
well i could also notice denominator 
factors 
x squared minus x plus one, i 
rewrite that 
sound x squared minus x plus one is x 
minus one squared 
sound so instead evaluating this 
limit, i could try to look this limit, 
limit x plus two x minus one 
squared x approaches one 
i know 
numerator is x plus two if x is 
close to one, i make x plus two close 
to three 
denominator 
a number close to one, minus one squared, 
is a number close to zero 
a number close to zero 
a positive number close to zero 
so let write this 
alright 
numerator sound is three 
sound denominator sound is 

well, small positive 
number 
sound 
happens if i take a number, 
like, near three, divide a 
number is small positive 
that number big i like 
so i make this quantity large i 
like, if i make x close enough to one 
i make numerator close to 
three, i make denominator 
close to zero positive i like 
if i take a number close to three 
divide a number close to zero, i 
make a number large i want 
so this limit sound is equal to 
infinity 
homework includes even trickier 
situations 
instance, limit problems x 
approaches negative infinity, instead 
infinity
