00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,251
[MUSIC]. 
A lot of calculus is about understanding 

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:08,493
the qualitative features of functions. 
Nobody really cares about f of 17. 

3
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:12,276
But you might care about f of a big 
number, qualitatively. 

4
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:16,921
We're going to try to make this concept 
of big number a bit more precise. 

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,300
Well, here's how we're going to get 
around talking about a big number. 

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,675
We're going to talk about the limit. 
The limit of f of x as x approaches 

7
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:30,259
infinity equals to l. 
Means that f of x is as close as you want 

8
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,980
it to be to l, provided x is large 
enough. 

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,167
So instead of talking about just plugging 
in a big number, I'm going to say F at 

10
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:43,623
some big number, so to speak, is equal to 
L if I can make the output of F close to 

11
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:48,474
L by plugging in big enough numbers. 
At this point we've seen a bunch of 

12
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:53,163
different definitions of limits. 
But they're all united by a common theme. 

13
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:58,292
What if someone had asked us to cook up a 
definition of the limit of F of X equals 

14
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:02,618
infinity as X goes to infinity? 
Could we come up with a definition for 

15
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,966
this? 
Yeah, absolutely we can, here we go. 

16
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:09,786
The limit of F of X as X approaches 
infinity equals infinity means that I can 

17
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:14,050
make F of X as large as you want it to be 
provided X is large enough. 

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,337
Consistently when we're talking about 
infinity in limits we're never actually 

19
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:22,350
talking about a specific value. 
We're just talking about a value which is 

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,320
as big as you want it to be. 
Let's go do an example at the blackboard. 

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,835
There is a question. 
With the limit, of 2x over x+1 as x 

22
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:36,861
approaches infinity. 
Before we dive into this analytically, 

23
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:42,144
lets get some numeric evidence. 
This is my function, again fx)= of 2x 

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,637
over x+1.1. 
I want to know qualitatively, what 

25
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:50,067
happens when I plug in big numbers in 
this function? 

26
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,260
So, lets say f100). 
of 100. 

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:02:00,066
Well, that's not too hard to figure out. 
22 times 100 is 200 and 100 plus one is 

28
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:04,799
101. 
Now, 200 divided by 101 is pretty close 

29
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,754
to 2. 
And there's nothing too special about 

30
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,514
100, right? 
If I'd done this four million I would 

31
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:15,113
have gotten two million over a million in 
one, which would be even closer to 2. 

32
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:19,425
Numerically, it looks like this limit's 
two, but we just figured that out by 

33
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,220
plugging in some big numbers. 
I want a more rigorous argument, some 

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,980
analytic that is limit is actually equal 
to two. 

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,502
How I'm going to proceed? 
My first guess would be to use the limit 

36
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:34,075
law for quotients. 
This is the limit of a quotient which is 

37
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:38,314
the quotient of limits provided the 
limits exist and the limit of the 

38
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:42,190
denominator is none zero. 
Bad news here is the limits don't exist. 

39
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,824
The limit of the numerator is infinity 
which isn't a number. 

40
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,670
So I can't use my limit law for quotients 
here. 

41
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,970
Instead I'm going to sneak up on this 
limit problem by wearing a disguise. 

42
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,937
I'm going to multiply by a disguised 
version of one. 

43
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:59,268
I'm going to multiply by one over x 
divided by one over x. 

44
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:03,282
Now this is just one. 
Admittedly, I have changed the function. 

45
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:06,306
The function's not defined anymore at 
zero. 

46
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:10,174
But for large values of X, this doesn't 
affect anything. 

47
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:13,479
And I'm taking the limit as X goes to 
infinity. 

48
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,136
So I only care about agreement at large 
values of X. 

49
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:21,496
I'll do some algebra. 
This limit has now the limit of 2X times 

50
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:25,012
one over X. 
Which is two divided by the limit of X 

51
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:29,340
plus one times one over X. 
Which is one plus one over X. 

52
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,252
Maybe it doesn't look like I've made a 
lot of progress here, but this is a huge 

53
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:37,050
progress. 
The limit of the numerator is now a 

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,594
number, it's two. 
And the limit of the denominator is also 

55
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:43,020
a number. 
And a non zero number, at that. 

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,056
So I can use my limit law for quotients. 
This is the limit of a quotient, which is 

57
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:51,787
the quotient of a limit. 
It's the limit of two, the numerator 

58
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,270
divided by the limit of the denominator, 
as x approaches infinity. 

59
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,954
The limit of the numerator is just the 
limit of a constant, which is 2. 

60
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:05,160
The limit of the denominator is a limit 
of a sum, which is the sum of the limits 

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,520
provided the limits exist, and they do. 
The limit of 1 is just 1. 

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,948
And what's the limit of 1 over x as x 
approaches infinity? 

63
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:21,195
Well that's asking, what is 1 over x 
close to when x is very large? 

64
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:29,184
Well I can make 1 over x as close to zero 
as I like if I'm willing to make x large 

65
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:33,588
enough. 
So the limit of 1 over x as x approaches 

66
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:39,938
infinity is zero. 
That means my original limit is 2 over 1 

67
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:43,114
plus zero, which is 2.
