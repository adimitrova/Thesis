sound infinity is a number like 
seventeen 
dont treat a number 
let, let show you something that 
people time 
here is 
people write interval zero 
to infinity including zero, is fine 
including infinity, is 
okay 
infinitys a number 
people writing is 
this 
interval zero to infinity 
including zero including 
infinity 
infinitys a number 
i freaking this 
whats so bad thinking infinity 
if number 
now, if you start trying to arithmetic 
infinity, youre liable to walk 
straight a trap 
let demonstrate you walking 
one traps 
lets treat infinity if a 
number 
well, whats infinity plus one in that 
case 
i got infinitely many things i add 
one 
thats infinitely many 
things 
so, infinity plus one would equal 
infinity 
now, else would i know 
infinity a number 
well, would infinity minus infinity 
equal to 
this would a number minus itself, 
a number minus is zero 
so, youre going to treat infinity a 
number, 
youre going to believing two 
statements 
youre going to believe infinity plus one 
is infinity youre going to believe 
infinity minus infinity is equal to zero 
this is numbers would work 
this is actually bad 
lets look infinity plus one 
minus infinity, lets subtract 
infinity sides 
you said infinity minus infinity is 
equal to zero 
but, whats infinity plus one minus 
infinity 
well, that would infinity minus 
infinity plus one 
infinity minus infinity is zero 
this would zero plus one 
that side would one 
so, if youre going to treat infinity 
like a number, youre going to end 
telling that one equals zero 
thats ridiculous 
upshot here is that you cant 
arithmetic infinity 
infinitys a number like seventeen 
something comes to save day 
we limits 
instance, 
consider this problem im a 
calculation involving infinity 
instead working infinity 
directly, im phrasing a limit 
question 
whats limit x x x 
approaches infinity 
well, x is large i like 
making x big enough, i make x 
big i like 
x is also large i like, 
making x big enough, i make x 
big i like 
happens if i multiply together 
two numbers large i like 
well, product two numbers that 
big i want to big 
i want to 
so, in that sense, limit x x 
x approaches infinity is equal to 
infinity 
so, original example 
whats infinity minus infinity 
laugh well, depends 
heres one possibility 
lets consider limit x x x 
approaches infinity 
now, this is a limit a difference 
you might remember back, limit a 
difference is a difference limits 
provided limits exist 
ignoring that last part whether 
limits exist, 
laugh you might blindly start 
writing limit x approaches 
infinity x minus limit x x 
approaches infinity 
this is good, 
right 
limit x x approaches 
infinity, thats equal to infinity 
limit x x approaches 
infinity, thats infinity, 
right 
i make x large i like if x is 
big enough, 
i make x large i like if x 
is big enough 
so, happened 
im running limit a difference 
difference limits, 
limits dont exist, 
right 
theyre equal to infinity infinity is 
a number 
now, im left infinity minus 
infinity 
i dont know to do, right 
knows thats equal to 
thats exactly sort thing im 
permitted to think 
instead, if i wanted to know limit 
x x x approaches infinity, i could 
rewrite this limit limit x goes 
to infinity of, 
whats another way writing x x 
could write x x 
we saw a minute ago that 
limit x x x approaches 
infinity is equal to infinity 
so, in this case, seems that infinity 
minus infinity is infinity 
hand, infinity minus 
infinity could seventeen 
lets see 
here again, ive got a limit a 
difference two things 
something minus something x approaches 
infinity 
now, if i blindly apply limit 
a difference difference limits 
without remembering that thats 
valid if limits exist, lets see 
happens 
then, i get limit x approaches 
infinity first thing, is x 
, minus limit second thing 
is x 
now, whats limit x x 
approaches infinity 
well, i make x large i 
like if x is big enough, so thats 
infinity 
whats limit x x approaches 
infinity 
well, i make x large i like if 
x is big enough, so thats also infinity 
so ive walked trap 
writing infinity minus infinity, 
right i applied limit a 
difference equals difference 
limits without remembering that thats 
valid if limits exist 
in this case, limits exist 
in weak sense that i write 
that equal infinity 
anyway, i dont want that 
now, could i figure this 
limits equal to 
well, this is a limit something i 
could rearrange something, 
right 
this is limit x 
approaches infinity 
whats another way writing this 
x x, 
i could written seventeen 
now, limit seventeen is x 
approaches infinity 
well, limit seventeen x 
approaches anything 
thats seventeen 
so, in this admittedly contrived case, 
infinity minus infinity ended equaling 
seventeen 
sound
