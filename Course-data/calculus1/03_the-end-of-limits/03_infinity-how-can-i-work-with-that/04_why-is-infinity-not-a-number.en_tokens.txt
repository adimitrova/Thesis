infinity
is
not
a
number
like
seventeen
.
do
n't
treat
it
as
a
number
.
let
,
let
me
show
you
something
that
people
do
all
of
the
time
.
here
it
is
.
people
write
down
the
interval
from
zero
to
infinity
including
zero
,
which
is
fine
but
including
infinity
,
which
is
not
okay
.
infinity
's
not
a
number
.
what
people
should
be
writing
down
is
this
.
the
interval
from
zero
to
infinity
including
zero
but
not
including
infinity
.
because
infinity
's
not
a
number
.
why
am
i
freaking
out
about
this
?
what
's
so
bad
about
thinking
of
infinity
as
if
it
were
some
number
?
now
,
if
you
start
trying
to
do
arithmetic
with
infinity
,
you
're
liable
to
walk
straight
into
a
trap
.
let
me
demonstrate
for
you
by
walking
into
one
of
these
traps
myself
.
let
's
treat
infinity
as
if
it
were
a
number
.
well
,
what
's
infinity
plus
one
in
that
case
?
i
got
infinitely
many
things
and
i
add
one
more
.
that
's
the
same
as
having
infinitely
many
things
.
so
,
infinity
plus
one
would
equal
infinity
.
now
,
what
else
would
i
know
about
infinity
as
a
number
?
well
,
what
would
infinity
minus
infinity
be
equal
to
?
this
would
be
a
number
minus
itself
,
and
a
number
minus
itself
is
zero
.
so
,
you
're
going
to
treat
infinity
as
a
number
,
you
're
going
to
be
believing
these
two
statements
.
you
're
going
to
believe
infinity
plus
one
is
infinity
and
you
're
going
to
believe
infinity
minus
infinity
is
equal
to
zero
.
this
is
how
these
numbers
would
work
.
this
is
actually
very
bad
.
let
's
just
look
at
infinity
plus
one
minus
infinity
,
and
let
's
subtract
infinity
from
both
sides
.
and
you
said
infinity
minus
infinity
is
equal
to
zero
.
but
,
what
's
infinity
plus
one
minus
infinity
?
well
,
that
would
be
infinity
minus
infinity
plus
one
.
infinity
minus
infinity
is
zero
.
this
would
be
zero
plus
one
.
that
side
would
be
one
.
so
,
if
you
're
going
to
treat
infinity
like
a
number
,
you
're
going
to
end
up
telling
me
that
one
equals
zero
.
that
's
ridiculous
.
the
upshot
here
is
that
you
ca
n't
do
arithmetic
with
infinity
.
infinity
's
not
a
number
like
seventeen
.
but
something
comes
to
save
the
day
.
we
can
do
limits
.
for
instance
,
consider
this
problem
where
i
'm
doing
a
calculation
involving
infinity
.
but
instead
of
working
with
infinity
directly
,
i
'm
phrasing
it
as
a
limit
question
.
what
's
the
limit
of
x
*
x
-
1
as
x
approaches
infinity
?
well
,
x
is
as
large
as
i
like
.
by
making
x
big
enough
,
i
can
make
x
as
big
as
i
like
.
x
-
1
is
also
as
large
as
i
like
,
by
making
x
big
enough
,
i
can
make
x
-
1
as
big
as
i
like
.
and
what
happens
if
i
multiply
together
two
numbers
which
are
as
large
as
i
like
?
well
,
the
product
of
two
numbers
that
are
as
big
as
i
want
them
to
be
can
be
as
big
as
i
want
them
to
be
.
so
,
in
that
sense
,
the
limit
of
x
*
x
-
1
as
x
approaches
infinity
is
equal
to
infinity
.
so
,
what
about
our
original
example
?
what
's
infinity
minus
infinity
?
[
laugh
]
well
,
it
depends
.
here
's
one
possibility
.
let
's
consider
the
limit
of
x^2
-
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
now
,
this
is
a
limit
of
a
difference
.
you
might
remember
back
,
the
limit
of
a
difference
is
a
difference
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
ignoring
that
last
part
about
whether
the
limits
exist
,
[
laugh
]
you
might
just
blindly
start
writing
down
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
x^2
minus
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
this
is
no
good
,
right
?
the
limit
of
x^2
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
that
's
equal
to
infinity
.
and
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
that
's
infinity
,
right
?
i
can
make
x^2
as
large
as
i
like
if
x
is
big
enough
,
and
i
can
make
x
as
large
as
i
like
if
x
is
big
enough
.
so
,
what
just
happened
?
i
'm
running
the
limit
of
a
difference
as
the
difference
of
the
limits
,
but
these
limits
do
n't
exist
,
right
?
they
're
equal
to
infinity
and
infinity
is
not
a
number
.
now
,
i
'm
left
with
infinity
minus
infinity
.
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
right
?
who
knows
what
that
's
equal
to
?
that
's
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
i
'm
not
permitted
to
think
about
.
instead
,
if
i
wanted
to
know
the
limit
of
x^2
-
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
i
could
rewrite
this
limit
as
the
limit
as
x
goes
to
infinity
of
,
what
's
another
way
of
writing
x^2
-
x
?
could
write
it
as
x
*
x
-
1.
and
we
saw
just
a
minute
ago
that
the
limit
of
x
*
x
-
1
as
x
approaches
infinity
is
equal
to
infinity
.
so
,
in
this
case
,
it
seems
that
infinity
minus
infinity
is
infinity
.
on
the
other
hand
,
infinity
minus
infinity
could
be
seventeen
.
let
's
see
how
.
here
again
,
i
've
got
a
limit
of
a
difference
of
two
things
.
something
minus
something
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
now
,
if
i
blindly
just
apply
the
limit
of
a
difference
as
the
difference
of
limits
without
remembering
that
that
's
only
valid
if
the
limits
exist
,
let
's
see
what
happens
.
and
then
,
i
get
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
the
first
thing
,
which
is
x
+
17
,
minus
the
limit
of
the
second
thing
which
is
just
x.
now
,
what
's
the
limit
of
x
+
17
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
well
,
i
can
make
x
+
17
as
large
as
i
like
if
x
is
big
enough
,
so
that
's
infinity
.
and
what
's
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
?
well
,
i
can
make
x
as
large
as
i
like
if
x
is
big
enough
,
so
that
's
also
infinity
.
so
i
've
again
walked
into
the
trap
of
writing
down
infinity
minus
infinity
,
right
?
i
applied
the
limit
of
a
difference
equals
the
difference
of
the
limits
without
remembering
that
that
's
only
valid
if
the
limits
exist
.
and
in
this
case
,
the
limits
only
exist
in
the
weak
sense
that
i
can
write
down
that
they
equal
infinity
.
anyway
,
i
do
n't
want
do
that
.
now
,
how
could
i
figure
out
what
this
limit
's
equal
to
?
well
,
this
is
a
limit
of
something
and
i
could
rearrange
the
something
,
right
?
this
is
the
same
as
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
what
's
another
way
of
writing
this
?
x
+
17
-
x
,
i
could
have
just
written
seventeen
.
now
,
what
the
limit
of
seventeen
is
as
x
approaches
infinity
?
well
,
what
the
limit
of
seventeen
as
x
approaches
anything
at
all
?
that
's
just
seventeen
.
so
,
in
this
admittedly
contrived
case
,
infinity
minus
infinity
ended
up
equaling
seventeen
.
