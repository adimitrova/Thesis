a lot calculus is understanding 
qualitative features functions 
nobody really cares f 
you might care f a big 
number, qualitatively 
going to try to make this concept 
big number a bit precise 
well, heres going to get 
around talking a big number 
going to talk limit 
limit f x x approaches 
infinity equals to l 
means that f x is close you want 
to to l, provided x is large 
enough 
so instead talking plugging 
in a big number, im going to say f 
big number, so to speak, is equal to 
l if i make output f close to 
l plugging in big enough numbers 
this point weve seen a bunch 
different definitions limits 
theyre united a common theme 
if someone asked us to cook a 
definition limit f x equals 
infinity x goes to infinity 
could we come a definition 
this 
yeah, absolutely we can, here we go 
limit f x x approaches 
infinity equals infinity means that i 
make f x large you want to 
provided x is large enough 
consistently talking 
infinity in limits never actually 
talking a specific value 
talking a value is 
big you want to 
lets go an example blackboard 
there is a question 
limit, x x x 
approaches infinity 
we dive this analytically, 
lets get numeric evidence 
this is function, fx x 
x 
i want to know qualitatively, 
happens i plug in big numbers in 
this function 
so, lets say f 

well, thats hard to figure 
times is plus one is 
now, divided is pretty close 
to 
theres nothing special 
, right 
if id done this four million i would 
gotten two million a million in 
one, would even closer to 
numerically, looks like this limits 
two, we figured that 
plugging in big numbers 
i want a rigorous argument, 
analytic that is limit is actually equal 
to two 
im going to proceed 
first guess would to use limit 
law quotients 
this is limit a quotient is 
quotient limits provided 
limits exist limit 
denominator is none zero 
bad news here is limits dont exist 
limit numerator is infinity 
isnt a number 
so i cant use limit law quotients 
here 
instead im going to sneak this 
limit problem wearing a disguise 
im going to multiply a disguised 
version one 
im going to multiply one x 
divided one x 
this is one 
admittedly, i changed function 
functions defined anymore 
zero 
large values x, this doesnt 
affect anything 
im taking limit x goes to 
infinity 
so i care agreement large 
values x 
ill algebra 
this limit limit x times 
one x 
is two divided limit x 
plus one times one x 
is one plus one x 
maybe doesnt look like ive made a 
lot progress here, this is a huge 
progress 
limit numerator is a 
number, two 
limit denominator is also 
a number 
a non zero number, that 
so i use limit law quotients 
this is limit a quotient, is 
quotient a limit 
limit two, numerator 
divided limit denominator, 
x approaches infinity 
limit numerator is 
limit a constant, is 
limit denominator is a limit 
a sum, is sum limits 
provided limits exist, 
limit is 
whats limit x x 
approaches infinity 
well thats asking, is x 
close to x is large 
well i make x close to zero 
i like if im willing to make x large 
enough 
so limit x x approaches 
infinity is zero 
that means original limit is 
plus zero, is
