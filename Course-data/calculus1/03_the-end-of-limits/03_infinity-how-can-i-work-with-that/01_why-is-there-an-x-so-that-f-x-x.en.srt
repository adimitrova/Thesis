00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,487
[SOUND] Here's an application of the 
intermediate value theorem I'm very fond 

2
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,317
of. 
Here's how it goes. 

3
00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:14,222
Suppose you've got a function f. 
f is continuous in the closed interval 

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:19,378
between zero and one. 
And whenever x is between zero and one, f 

5
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:25,533
of x is between zero and one. 
So that's what you've got to suppose when 

6
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:30,440
you get out of this. 
Then, there is a point x, x between zero 

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,513
and one, and f of x = x. 
It's telling you that there exists an 

8
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:37,051
input. 
So that if you apply f to that input 

9
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:41,243
value, you get the output which is the 
same as the thing you plugged in. 

10
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:45,670
You call these things fixed points. 
You imagine that f is moving around the 

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,389
points between zero and one, 
and you're finding a point x which 

12
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:53,049
doesn't move a fixed point. 
Why is something like this true? 

13
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,963
Let's see. 
Let me use the Intermediate Value Theorem 

14
00:00:55,963 --> 00:01:00,090
but I'm not going to apply the 
Intermediate Value Theorem to f but I'm 

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,610
going to make up a new function. g(x) = 
f(x) - x. 

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,409
What do I know about g? 
g's continuous. 

17
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,712
f is continuous by assumption. 
The identity function x is continuous and 

18
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:15,469
differences of continuous functions are 
continuous. 

19
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,667
So, g is a continuous function and the 
closed interval 01. 

20
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:23,571
I also know some of the values of g. 
What's g of zero? 

21
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:29,611
Well, g(0) is by definition f(0) - 0. 
f(0) is between zero and one. 

22
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,147
So I've got a number between zero and one 
minus zero, 

23
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:38,160
that number's at least zero. 
I also know something about g(1). 

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,920
g(1) is by definition f(1) - 1 f(1) is 
between zero and one, it could be zero, 

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,526
could be one. 
But, a number between zero and one minus 

26
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:53,127
one is less than or equal to zero. 
What do I know altogether? 

27
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:57,884
I've got a continuous function g, its 
value at zero is bigger than equal to 

28
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,701
zero. 
Its value at one is less than equal to 

29
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:03,455
zero. 
By the intermediate value theorem, this 

30
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:10,059
gives me a point x so that g(x) = 0. 
Why do I care about finding a point x so 

31
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:14,871
that g(x) is equal to zero? 
Well, if I take a look at what g(x) is 

32
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:20,520
equal to, g(x) is f(x) - x. 
So, I found a point x so that f(x) - x is 

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,565
equal to zero. 
I found a point x so that f(x) = x, I 

34
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:32,624
found the fixed point. 
So, we've seen why this is true. 

35
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:38,380
Let'd try to apply this to a specific 
example life f(x) equals cosine x. 

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,755
Now, here I've got a graph of cosine and 
that the graph of y equals cosine x. 

37
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:49,797
Now, what do I know about cosine? 
I know cosine's continuous and cosine of 

38
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:54,148
a number between zero and one is a number 
between zero and one. 

39
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:58,569
So, our statement applies to it. 
There's a fixed point for cosine. 

40
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,920
There's some value of x between zero and 
one so cosine of x equals x. 

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,960
Let's see if we can find that on a 
computer. 

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,028
Okay. 
I've got cosine loaded up on to my 

43
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:13,905
computer. 
Cosine of one is about 0.54. 

44
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:19,083
Let me decrease the input. 
And I notice that cosine of 0.68 is 0.77. 

45
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,782
Here the input is smaller than the 
output. 

46
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:29,496
Let me increase the input. 
Now, notice what happened. 

47
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:34,415
Now the input is 0.74 but the output is 
smaller than 0.74. 

48
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:39,720
Cosine of 0.74 is just 0.73. 
Now, it decreased the input. 

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,253
Oh, the opposite thing happened. 
Now the input is smaller than the output. 

50
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:49,540
Now, I'll increase the input. 
I'll decrease the input. 

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,663
Increase the input. 
And you can see that I, I can sort of 

52
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:03,319
zoom in or narrow in on the correct value 
of of x so that cosine of x is equal to 

53
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:11,145
x. 
Sees in the computer I found that this 

54
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:19,844
point here is at about 0.739. 
So, without a number between zero and 

55
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:24,525
one, cosine of that number is itself. 
It's a fixed point for cosine. 

56
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:29,844
These kinds of fixed point theorem 
statements that assert the existence of 

57
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:32,540
fixed points, 
they pervade mathematics. 

58
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,583
Here's another example. 
I've got a map of Ohio right here. 

59
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,916
Let me apply a continuous function to 
this map. 

60
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,179
[SOUND] I'm going to throw it down to the 
ground, 

61
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,300
stomp on it. 
And now let's take a look at it. 

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,442
[SOUND] The question is, is there a point 
on the map which is exactly above its 

63
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:05,498
corresponding point in the ground? 
And indeed there is. 

64
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:11,378
I'll use this pin to stab through that 
point. 

65
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,424
