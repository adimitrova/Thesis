00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,812
People have thought, people have wondered 
about infinity for thousands of years. 

2
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:11,846
We're going to continue that tradition of 
thinking about infinity, but we're going 

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:16,555
to focus in on one specific instance of 
infinity in mathematics. 

4
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:21,706
What does it mean to say that the limit 
of a function equals infinity? 

5
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:26,047
Here's what it means. 
The limit of F of X, as X approaches A 

6
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:30,315
equals infinity means that F of X is as 
large as you like. 

7
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:35,186
Provided x is close enough to A. 
As a bit of a warning, I'm not saying 

8
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:39,880
that this number limit F of X, X 
approaches A is equal to this number, 

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,030
infinity is not a number. 
What I am doing here is attaching a 

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,267
precise meaning to the entire statement 
that the limit of F of X is infinity. 

11
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:53,893
So, that's what it means precisely, but 
what does it mean practically. 

12
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:56,677
Let's go to the board. 
This is an example, 

13
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:00,268
the limit of one over X squared as X 
approaches zero. 

14
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:05,688
Now this limit is not equal to a number. 
One over X squared is not getting close 

15
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:10,837
to a number when X is approaches zero. 
But one over X squared is as big as I 

16
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,360
want it to be if I'm willing to put X 
close to zero. 

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,884
For instance, if X is within a 1000th of 
zero, what happens? 

18
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:27,313
Well to say X is within a 1000th of zero 
is to say that X is between minus.00 

19
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:31,694
and.001. 
Now, X is also non zero here because I 

20
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:38,171
don't want to divide by zero. 
So I've got a non zero number within a 

21
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:42,118
1000th of zero. 
What does that mean about X squared? 

22
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,406
[SOUND]. 
Well that means that X squared is, it's 

23
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:50,722
bigger than zero because if I square any 
non zero number, it's positive and it's 

24
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:55,759
less than, [SOUND] a millionth. 
So if I take a number within a thousandth 

25
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,957
of zero and I square it, that was within 
a millionth of zero. 

26
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:03,944
And [SOUND] what does that mean about one 
over X squared? 

27
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:09,121
Well if X squared is within a millionth 
of zero, one over X squared is now 

28
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:12,990
bigger, [SOUND] than a million. 
What happened, right? 

29
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,770
I made one over x squared very large by 
making x close enough but not equal to 

30
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,553
zero. 
And there's nothing particularly special 

31
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:24,002
about these numbers. 
If I wanted one over x squared to be 

32
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:28,601
bigger than a trillion, I would just need 
x to be within a millionth of zero. 

33
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:32,474
This example is at once maybe too 
complicated because I've got some 

34
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:36,528
explicit numbers in here. 
And maybe this formula is not complicated 

35
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:39,614
enough to, to really get a sense of 
what's going on. 

36
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:42,700
Let's look at a slightly more complicated 
function. 

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,691
So what's the limit of X plus two over X 
squared minus 2x plus one as X approaches 

38
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:54,195
one. 
And this is a limit of a quotient. 

39
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:58,600
So your first temptation is to think the 
limit of a quotient the quotients the 

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,220
limits. 
But what's the limit of the denominator? 

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,510
The denominator is a polynomial. 
Polynomials are continuous. 

42
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,468
So I can evaluate the limit of the 
denominator just by plugging in one. 

43
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,256
And if I plug in one, I get one minus two 
plus one. 

44
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,988
That's zero. 
The limit of the denominator is zero. 

45
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:18,225
So I can't simply say that the limit of 
the quotient is the quotient of the 

46
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:21,570
limits in this case. 
Because the limit of the denominator is 

47
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,191
zero. 
And that limit law does not apply in this 

48
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,034
case. 
What am I going to do? 

49
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:30,070
Well I could also notice the denominator 
factors. 

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,942
X squared minus 2X plus one, I can 
rewrite that. 

51
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:38,801
[SOUND] X squared minus 2X plus one is X 
minus one squared. 

52
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:45,226
[SOUND] So instead of evaluating this 
limit, I could try to look at this limit, 

53
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:50,910
the limit of X plus two over X minus one 
squared as X approaches one. 

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,280
Now what do I know? 
The numerator is X plus two and if X is 

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,930
close to one, I can make X plus two close 
to three. 

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,384
What about the denominator? 
A number close to one, minus one squared, 

57
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:13,357
is a number close to zero. 
But not just a number close to zero. 

58
00:04:13,357 --> 00:04:19,427
It's a positive number close to zero. 
So let me write this down. 

59
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:23,762
Alright. 
The numerator [SOUND] is about three. 

60
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:28,579
[SOUND] And the denominator [SOUND] is 
about what? 

61
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,529
Well, it's some small but positive 
number. 

62
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,745
[SOUND]. 
And what happens if I take a number, 

63
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:40,499
like, near three, and divide it by a 
number which is small and positive? 

64
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:45,797
That number can be as big as I like. 
So I can make this quantity as large as I 

65
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:50,646
like, if I make x close enough to one. 
Because I can make the numerator close to 

66
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:54,929
three, and I can make the denominator as 
close to zero and positive as I like. 

67
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:59,379
And if I take a number close to three and 
divide it by a number close to zero, I 

68
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,329
can make a number as large as I want. 
So this limit [SOUND] is equal to 

69
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:07,526
infinity. 
The homework includes even trickier 

70
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:12,352
situations. 
For instance, limit problems where x 

71
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:17,383
approaches negative infinity, instead of 
infinity.
