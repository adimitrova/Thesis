1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
[MUSIC] So, I get a number like the 
square root of two. 

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,724
And square root of two is irrational. 
So, how am I going to figure out what 

3
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:12,541
it's approximately equal to? 
Well, it turns out that it's 

4
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,540
approximately, you know, 1.414 and a bit 
more. 

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,902
But how would ever figure that out? 
How would I know that that's 

6
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:23,310
approximately the value of the square 
root of two? 

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,966
Let's use the intermediate value theorem 
to try to pull it. 

8
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:31,862
I want to use the intermediate value 
theorem to approximate the square root of 

9
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:33,969
two. 
To do that, I'm going to use this 

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,820
function, 
f(x) = x^2 - 2. 

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,475
Notice something about this function. 
This function is equal to zero when x is 

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,722
the square root of 2. 
And how is that? 

13
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:50,305
f of the square root of 2 is the squared 
of two squared, which is two, minus two, 

14
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,970
which is zero. 
So, if I'm trying to approximate the 

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,822
square root of 2, what I'm going to think 
about this, is that I'm going to look for 

16
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:00,490
a positive value, that I can plug into 
this function to make it a square root of 

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,971
zero. 
How am I going to find such a value? 

18
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:08,570
You know, the other good thing about this 
function is that it's continuous. 

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,113
And then, I can plug in some values, like 
f(1). 

20
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,718
Now, what's f(1)? 
It's one squared minus two and that's 

21
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,702
minus one. 
And I can plot that on my graph right 

22
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:25,201
here, and it's this point right here. 
And take a look at, say, f(2). 

23
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:29,543
f(2) would be two squared minus two, 
which is two. 

24
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:33,066
And I can plot that on my graph, right 
here. 

25
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,820
It's 2, 
2. 

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,300
Now, f is a continuous function and at 
one, it's negative. 

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,072
And at two, it's positive. 
So, it's a continuous function. 

28
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:50,543
It's negative at one and it's positive at 
two. 

29
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,627
By the intermediate value theorem, there 
must be a point in between when the 

30
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:58,174
functions value is equal to zero. 
And you can see that on the graph. 

31
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,989
We're looking for that point. 
That is the square root of two where this 

32
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,407
graph crosses the x-axis, 
the positive x-axis. 

33
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,772
And that's the point that we're looking 
for, 

34
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:09,243
right? 
The intermediate value theorem promises 

35
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:12,897
me there's a value in between where the 
functions value equals zero. 

36
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:16,068
And I can see that there must be such a 
point on the graph. 

37
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:18,970
And now, I know that that value is 
between one and two. 

38
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,061
And I can do better. 
I can cut this interval between one and 

39
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:34,227
two in half and I get that f(1.5). 
Well, 1.5 squared is 2.25 - 2 is 0.25. 

40
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:41,312
[SOUND] Alright. 
So, that's, say, this point on my graph. 

41
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:45,309
Now, what do I know? 
I know that the squared of two, which is 

42
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:50,186
where this graph crosses the x-axis, is 
between one, where the function is 

43
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:53,370
negative and 1.5, where the function is 
positive. 

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,271
And I can do better, 
alright? 

45
00:02:55,271 --> 00:03:00,596
I can pick some other point. 
Let's be brave and pick 1.4. 

46
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:05,350
And if I plug in 1.4, well, 14 squared is 
196. 

47
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,009
So, 1.4 squared is 1.96 - 2, 
that makes this -0.4, 

48
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,812
alright? 
This is barely below the x-axis. 

49
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:20,611
And I can plot that point here. 
And now, I know that the square root of 

50
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:25,476
two, the positive input to this function, 
which is equal to zero, 

51
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:31,267
well, it must be between 1.4 and 1.5. 
Because the function's value at 1.4 is 

52
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:35,360
negative and the function's value at 1.5 
is positive. 

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,828
So, this is not so bad. 
I mean, we, we could do this with a few 

54
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,644
calculations on the blackboard. 
Let's, let's bring out some sort of 

55
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:47,037
computation device so we can try to get 
an even better approximation to the 

56
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,754
square root of two. 
So here, I've got a function. 

57
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:54,668
The function is f(x) = x^2 - 2. 
And you can see that if I plug zero into 

58
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:59,120
the function, I get out -2 because 0^2 - 
2 is -2. 

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,421
Now, this is a physical function. 
I've got this knob here. And as I spin 

60
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,828
this knob, the function's input value 
changes. 

61
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:14,417
So, for example, if I spin it up to 
f(05.), f(1/2), that's negative 1.75 and 

62
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:20,172
that's right because if I take a half 
squared, I get a quarter, and a quarter 

63
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:24,337
minus two is -1.75. 
Now, I could spin the input up to one. 

64
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:35,114
f(1) is -1 = because 1^2 - 2 is -1 or 
f(1.5), well, 1.5 squared is 2.25, 2.25 - 

65
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:41,334
1 is 0.25. 
Now, this is positive or I could wheel it 

66
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:48,565
back down a little bit. 
And I see that when I get to 1.41, the 

67
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:53,902
function's output is negative again. 
Then, I could increase the function's 

68
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:59,293
input a bit. 
Oh, now the function's output is positive 

69
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:04,073
again, at f(1.145). 
And then, I could decrease the value a 

70
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:07,545
little bit. 
Oh, 

71
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:12,081
now, the function's output value is 
negative again and that would increase 

72
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:15,503
the output value a little bit. 
Oh, 

73
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:20,320
now, the function's output is positive 
and I could decrease the input a bit. 

74
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,540
Now, the function's output is negative, 
could increase the input a little bit. 

75
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,220
Now, it's positive, could decrease the 
input a little bit. 

76
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,333
Now, it's negative again. 
Now, Look at what happened, 

77
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,703
right? 
What's going on? 

78
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:45,768
I'm looking at the function f(x) = x^2 - 
2 and I'm walking back and forth across 

79
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:48,956
the point where this function is equal to 
zero. 

80
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:54,045
And as I walk to the left and to the 
right, the function is positive and the 

81
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:58,048
function is negative. 
And I'm getting closer and closer to a, 

82
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:03,407
to the actual place where the function is 
equal to zero and what is 1.41421356? 

83
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,460
It's awfully close to the square root of 
two. 

84
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,820
And if you think the square root of two 
and square it and subtract two, you get 

85
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,985
zero. 
What we just saw with the knob that I was 

86
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:20,166
turning is actually an incredibly general 
technique for figuring out where a 

87
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,746
continuous function crosses the x-axis. 
And we can do it very efficiently. 

88
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:28,773
Let's take a look at how we might do this 
a little bit more carefully. 

89
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:33,260
Here, I've drawn a graph with some random 
looking continuous function and I've 

90
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,690
labeled some points along the x-axis. 
Imagine that we couldn't see this whole 

91
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,394
graph. 
Just imagine that the only thing you can 

92
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:44,536
do is interrogate this function. 
You can ask this function at some input 

93
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:48,784
point, are you positive or negative? 
We're trying to figure out where, 

94
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,710
approximately, this continuous function 
crosses the x-axis. 

95
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,299
We're looking for a zero of this 
continuous function. 

96
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:00,767
How might the game begin? 
I'll let it begin by asking the function, 

97
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:05,710
are you positive or negative at zero? 
And the function is positive at zero. 

98
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,144
And then, maybe I'd ask at sixteen. 
At sixteen, is this function positive or 

99
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,901
negative? 
And I'd see the function is negative. 

100
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,538
The function's value is negative at 
sixteen. 

101
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,332
Because it's a continuous function and 
the function's value at zero is positive 

102
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:25,006
and the function's value at sixteen is 
negative, I know that there's a zero in 

103
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:27,882
between. 
There's some point in between that if I 

104
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,340
plug it into the function, I get zero 
out. 

105
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,598
Now, I could cut that interval in half. 
I could plug in eight and I could ask the 

106
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,367
function at f(8), are you positive or 
negative? 

107
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,800
And the function f(8), the value of the 
function at eight is positive. 

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,769
Now, look. 
I know the function's value at eight is 

109
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,982
positive, the function's value at sixteen 
is negative. 

110
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:52,588
So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, 
there must be a value in between, right 

111
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:55,073
there, where the function's value is 
zero. 

112
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:58,710
And now, I could take that interval and 
cut it in half again. 

113
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,135
I could take a look at twelve, which is 
exactly between eight and sixteen. 

114
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:06,711
And I could ask the function, at 
f(12),12), are you positive or negative? 

115
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,774
And the function's value at twelve is 
negative. 

116
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:14,458
[SOUND] So now, I know by the 
intermediate Value Theorem, the function 

117
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:19,420
zero zero of this function must land 
between eight and twelve and I could cut 

118
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,586
that interval in half again. 
I could look at ten, and I could ask the 

119
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,526
function, 
well, if I plug in ten, are you positive 

120
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:29,528
or negative? 
And the function's value with ten is 

121
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,572
negative. 
And now, I know that the zero must land 

122
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:36,921
between eight and ten, because the 
function's value at eight is positive and 

123
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:41,328
the function's value at ten is negative, 
so there must be a zero in between, a 

124
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,189
point where the function's value is equal 
to zero. 

125
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:47,967
Now, I could cut that interval between 
eight and ten in half again. 

126
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:52,431
I could look at nine. And I could ask the 
function, at nine, are you positive or 

127
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,380
negative? And if I plug in nine, it looks 
like the function is positive. 

128
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,172
And that means that a value that I can 
plug into the function to make the output 

129
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:06,472
zero lies between nine and ten. 
And this is really quite remarkable. 

130
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:11,043
I, I, I could cut the interval between 
nine and ten and half again and see if it 

131
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:15,325
was between nine and 9.5 or 9.5 and ten. 
And I could keep doing this every time 

132
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:20,012
I'm getting a little bit more precision 
as to the exact value of the input that 

133
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:24,478
would make the function zero. 
The other really neat thing about this is 

134
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:29,259
that I could have just tried all of the 
values between zero and sixteen. 

135
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:34,572
I could have plugged all seventeen of 
those numbers into the function to figure 

136
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:39,353
this out. But by doing this clever 
cutting in half method, this bisection 

137
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:42,208
method, I managed to only ask six 
questions, 

138
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,329
right? 
I asked the function's value at zero and 

139
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,977
sixteen, at eight and twelve, at ten and 
at nine, and by only asking six 

140
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:54,360
questions, I was able to narrow down a 
region where a zero resided. 

141
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,984
Now, that's pretty quite efficient, much 
better than asking seventeen questions. 

142
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:08,628
So, this is a very general technique for 
figuring out where zeroes of continuous 

143
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:13,384
functions lie. 
And I encourage you to pick your favorite 

144
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:19,414
function and see if you can approximate a 
root, a zero of that function. 

145
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,094
[MUSIC]
