00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,172
[MUSIC] Up to now, we've been thinking a 
lot about limits. 

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:09,150
We've been considering f(x) when x is 
close to but not equal to a. 

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,054
Let's refine that a bit now. 
Instead of thinking about x close to a. 

4
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:19,617
I'm going to think about x close to the 
right side of a or x close to the left 

5
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:21,830
side of a. 
Super-sized definition. 

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,722
So we say the limit of f(x) as x 
approaches a from the right, I'm going to 

7
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,619
use this little + sign to mean from the 
right. 

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:34,769
So if this is equal to l, it means that 
f(x) is as close as you want to l, this 

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:39,340
is just like before, provided x is near 
enough a on the right-hand side. 

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,413
So we're going to use a little + sign to 
denote approaching from the right-hand 

11
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,076
side. 
Now we're going to play a same game for 

12
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:51,769
approaching from the left-hand side. 
So let's say the limit of f(x) as x 

13
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:57,096
approaches a from the left-hand side is 
equal to l means that f(x) is as close as 

14
00:00:57,096 --> 00:01:02,170
you want to l just like usual, provided x 
is near enough a on the left-hand side. 

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,100
Let's go see some picture of this at the 
blackboard. 

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,590
Really helps to see a graph. 
Here's a graph of a made up function that 

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,242
I'm called f(x). 
You'll note that f(x) has some issues at 

18
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:17,908
the input 3. 
There's an empty circle here and a 

19
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:23,170
filled-in circle here so if I plug in 3, 
my output valley is 2. 

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,754
And indeed if I plug in numbers that are 
just a little bit above 3, I get out 

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,772
numbers that are close to 2. 
On the other hand, if I plug numbers that 

22
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:35,677
are a little bit less than 3, I get out 
numbers that are close to 1. 

23
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:39,072
We can summarize our observations with 
these two statements. 

24
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,883
The first is that the limit of f(x) as x 
approaches three from the right-hand side 

25
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,995
is equal to 2. 
And that makes sense because I can get 

26
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:51,466
the output of the function to be as close 
to 2 as I'd like if I'm willing to 

27
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:55,937
evaluate the function of inputs that are 
close to but just a little bit bigger 

28
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,574
than 3. 
Similarly, the limit of f(x) as x 

29
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:01,739
approaches two from the left-hand side is 
equal to 1. 

30
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,113
We think back in the graph, I was getting 
outputs that are close to one if I 

31
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:10,486
evaluated the function inputs which are 
close to, but just a little bit less, 

32
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:13,451
than 3. 
So in this case, the two sided limit 

33
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:17,207
doesn't exist. 
I can't say that f(x) is getting close to 

34
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:22,583
anything if all I know is that x is close 
to 3 but the left and the right hand 

35
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:28,023
limits do exist. I can say that f(x) is 
getting close to 1. If x approaches 3 

36
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:33,139
from the left-hand side, and I can say 
that f(x) is getting close to 2 if x 

37
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,471
approaches 3 from the right-hand side. 
This situation comes up quite a bit where 

38
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:43,445
you compute and you find that the right 
and the left hand limits exist but they 

39
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:47,300
disagree and consequently, the two side 
of limit doesn't exist. 

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,321
I can summarize it like this. 
If the limit of f(x) as x approaches a 

41
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:58,059
from the right, is different than the 
limit of f(x) as x approaches a from the 

42
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:03,870
left, then the two sided limit the limit 
of f(x) as x approaches a does not exist. 

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,766
It works the other way as well. 
If the limit from the right-hand side is 

44
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:14,070
equal to the limit from the left-hand 
side, let's call our common value l, then 

45
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,423
the two sided limit, the limit of f(x) as 
x approaches a, no + or -. 

46
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:23,659
So this is just the usual old limit. 
Then this limit exists and it's equal to 

47
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:31,937
that same common value, l. 
The homework will challenge you with many 

48
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:40,356
more situations of one sided limits.
