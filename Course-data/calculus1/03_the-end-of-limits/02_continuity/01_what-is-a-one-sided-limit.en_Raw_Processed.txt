music to now, weve thinking a 
lot limits 
weve considering fx x is 
close to equal to a 
lets refine that a bit 
instead thinking x close to a 
im going to think x close to 
right side a x close to left 
side a 
supersized definition 
so we say limit fx x 
approaches a right, im going to 
use this little sign to mean 
right 
so if this is equal to l, means that 
fx is close you want to l, this 
is like before, provided x is near 
enough a righthand side 
so going to use a little sign to 
denote approaching righthand 
side 
going to play a game 
approaching lefthand side 
so lets say limit fx x 
approaches a lefthand side is 
equal to l means that fx is close 
you want to l like usual, provided x 
is near enough a lefthand side 
lets go see picture this 
blackboard 
really helps to see a graph 
heres a graph a made function that 
im called fx 
youll note that fx issues 
input 
theres an empty circle here a 
filledin circle here so if i plug in , 
output valley is 
indeed if i plug in numbers that 
a little bit , i get 
numbers that close to 
hand, if i plug numbers that 
a little bit less , i get 
numbers that close to 
we summarize observations 
two statements 
first is that limit fx x 
approaches three righthand side 
is equal to 
that makes sense i get 
output function to close 
to id like if im willing to 
evaluate function inputs that 
close to a little bit bigger 

similarly, limit fx x 
approaches two lefthand side is 
equal to 
we think back in graph, i getting 
outputs that close to one if i 
evaluated function inputs 
close to, a little bit less, 

so in this case, two sided limit 
doesnt exist 
i cant say that fx is getting close to 
anything if i know is that x is close 
to left right hand 
limits exist i say that fx is 
getting close to if x approaches 
lefthand side, i say 
that fx is getting close to if x 
approaches righthand side 
this situation comes quite a bit 
you compute you find that right 
left hand limits exist 
disagree consequently, two side 
limit doesnt exist 
i summarize like this 
if limit fx x approaches a 
right, is different 
limit fx x approaches a 
left, two sided limit limit 
fx x approaches a exist 
works way well 
if limit righthand side is 
equal to limit lefthand 
side, lets call common value l, 
two sided limit, limit fx 
x approaches a, 
so this is usual old limit 
this limit exists equal to 
that common value, l
