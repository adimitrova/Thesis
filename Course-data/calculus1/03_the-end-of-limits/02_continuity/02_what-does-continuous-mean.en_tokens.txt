let
's
think
back
to
our
friend
the
square
root
function
.
what
's
the
square
root
of
two
?
well
,
the
square
root
of
two
is
about
what
's
the
square
root
of
2.01
?
it
's
awfully
close
.
it
's
1.417
and
a
bit
more
,
which
is
really
close
to
the
square
root
of
two
.
what
's
the
square
root
of
1.99
?
well
,
it
's
also
really
close
to
the
square
root
of
two
.
it
's
1.410
and
a
bit
more
,
which
is
really
close
to
1.414.
the
point
here
is
that
nearby
inputs
are
producing
nearby
outputs
.
let
's
try
to
see
these
numbers
.
what
does
the
graph
of
the
square
root
function
look
like
?
is
this
the
graph
of
the
square
root
function
?
take
a
look
at
what
happens
right
here
.
nearby
inputs
are
not
being
sent
to
nearby
outputs
.
inputs
very
close
to
two
.
say
something
a
little
bit
less
than
two
and
something
a
little
bit
bigger
than
two
,
are
being
sent
to
outputs
that
are
quite
far
apart
.
the
numbers
show
that
could
n't
have
been
the
graph
of
the
square
root
function
.
but
what
does
the
graph
for
the
square
root
function
look
like
?
this
is
what
the
graph
for
the
square
root
function
looks
like
.
it
looks
continuous
,
it
's
one
nice
curve
.
in
particular
,
nearby
inputs
give
rise
to
nearby
outputs
.
let
's
try
to
capture
the
concept
of
continuity
.
a
bit
more
precisely
than
just
a
picture
on
the
graph
.
here
's
sort
of
a
moral
definition
of
what
i
mean
when
i
say
f
of
x
is
continuous
at
a.
so
morally
i
mean
that
inputs
near
a
are
being
sent
to
outputs
near
f
of
a.
from
this
perspective
,
it
looks
like
the
function
,
f
of
x
equals
the
square
root
of
x
is
continuous
at
two
because
inputs
near
two
are
being
sent
to
outputs
near
the
square
root
of
two
.
how
do
we
make
this
intuition
a
little
bit
more
precise
?
here
is
a
precise
definition
,
to
say
that
f
of
x
is
continuous
at
a
is
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
is
equal
to
f
of
a.
now
think
back
to
what
we
mean
by
limit
,
to
say
that
the
limit
f
of
x
equals
f
of
a
is
to
say
that
i
can
make
f
of
x
as
close
to
f
of
a
as
you
like
as
long
as
x
is
close
enough
to
a.
but
that
's
really
the
spirit
of
continuity
.
continuity
is
trying
to
say
that
nearby
inputs
are
sent
to
nearby
outputs
,
and
this
limit
statement
is
capturing
that
sense
.
it
's
saying
that
i
can
make
the
output
close
to
the
output
at
a
as
long
as
the
input
is
close
to
a.
this
definition
's
pretty
involved
.
we
've
got
to
try
to
unpack
this
a
bit
.
what
does
it
really
mean
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
of
x
equals
f
of
a
as
x
approaches
a
?
to
make
this
statement
i
really
need
to
know
that
f
of
x
is
defined
at
the
point
a.
i
ca
n't
talk
about
f
of
a
unless
i
know
that
a
is
the
domain
of
f.
talk
about
the
limit
of
f
of
x
i
also
need
to
know
that
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
exists
.
i
need
this
to
be
some
number
so
i
can
talk
about
it
being
equal
to
some
other
number
.
well
once
i
've
got
these
two
statements
,
then
it
makes
sense
to
claim
that
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
is
equal
to
f
of
a.
but
before
i
can
make
this
third
and
final
statement
,
i
'm
really
assuming
that
these
two
preceding
things
hold
,
alright
.
so
the
definition
of
continuity
is
a
little
bit
more
subtle
than
it
seems
.
it
's
really
these
three
parts
.
the
function
has
to
be
defined
at
the
point
.
the
limit
has
to
exist
and
be
equal
to
some
number
,
and
then
i
can
say
that
number
,
the
limit
is
equal
to
the
functions
value
.
so
it
makes
sense
to
talk
about
the
function
at
that
point
.
nothing
we
've
done
so
far
really
captures
the
idea
that
the
graph
is
a
single
curve
,
a
single
continuous
curve
.
we
've
always
just
been
working
at
a
single
point
.
this
is
the
definition
of
continuity
at
the
single
point
a.
but
often
we
want
to
talk
about
continuity
on
a
whole
interval
at
once
.
so
we
'll
get
rid
of
this
and
we
'll
make
this
solely
a
fancier
definition
.
to
say
that
the
function
is
continuous
on
a
whole
interval
from
a
to
b
is
to
say
that
for
all
points
c
in
between
a
and
b
so
c
is
bigger
than
a
and
less
than
b
,
so
c
is
in
the
interval
a
to
b.
then
f
of
x
is
continuous
at
that
point
c.
so
this
is
what
we
mean
when
we
talk
about
continuity
on
a
whole
interval
at
once
.
so
that
's
the
definition
for
open
intervals
.
what
about
closed
intervals
?
we
have
to
be
even
a
bit
more
careful
when
we
talk
about
continuity
on
a
closed
interval
,
a
b
as
opposed
to
the
open
interval
a
b.
so
if
we
say
that
the
function
is
continuous
on
the
closed
interval
from
a
to
b.
we
mean
that
f
of
x
is
continuous
on
the
open
interval
from
a
to
b
so
in
between
a
and
b.
but
then
what
happens
at
a
and
at
b
?
well
,
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
from
the
right
hand
side
,
is
equal
to
f
of
a.
and
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
b
from
the
left
hand
side
is
equal
to
f
of
b
.
