[sound] so far, we've been selling  continuity as something about nearness.
continuous functions preserve nearness,  so nearby points gets into nearby points.
but continuity isn't just about how small  changes become small changes.
continuity has consequences for the  global structure of the function as well.
here's one of them.
i've graphed just some random looking  continuous function.
and i've picked a couple input points,  input point a,  input point b.  here is the point a, f of a,  here's the point b, f of b.  and on the y-axis i've got the value f of  a and the value f of b.  now, in between f of a and f of b, i've  just picked some random value.
i'm calling it y.  here's a consequence of continuity.
there has to be some corresponding input  x so that if i plug in x, [sound] i get  out y.  this is the so-called intermediate value  theorem.
let me write down a more precise  definition now.
so here's a statement of the intermediate  value theorem.
theorem says the following.
suppose f of x is continuous in the  closed interval between a and b, and that  y is some point between f of a and f of  b.  then, there's an x between a and b so  that the function's output, when you plug  in x, is equal to y.  here's a real world example, or if you  like, a real world non-example of the  intermediate value theorem.
is it possible for me to be standing here  in one moment and over here in the next  moment without actually occupying the  points in between?
what does the intermediate value theorem  say?
my position is a continuous function of  time.
so, if i'm standing here at say, time t  equals zero seconds, and i'm over here at  say, time equals three seconds,  mustn't there be a time when i'm  standing, say, right here?
yeah, maybe it's a time t equals two  seconds.
who knows?
what the intermediate value theorem says  is that for a continuous function, all of  the intermediate values are actually  achieved at some point along the way.
