1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,329
[SOUND] So far, we've been selling 
continuity as something about nearness. 

2
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:11,169
Continuous functions preserve nearness, 
so nearby points gets into nearby points. 

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:16,352
But continuity isn't just about how small 
changes become small changes. 

4
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:21,973
Continuity has consequences for the 
global structure of the function as well. 

5
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:26,191
Here's one of them. 
I've graphed just some random looking 

6
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,514
continuous function. 
And I've picked a couple input points, 

7
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,601
input point a, 
input point b. 

8
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:36,551
Here is the point a, f of a, 
here's the point b, f of b. 

9
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:41,395
And on the y-axis I've got the value f of 
a and the value f of b. 

10
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:46,463
Now, in between f of a and f of b, I've 
just picked some random value. 

11
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm calling it y. 
Here's a consequence of continuity. 

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,657
There has to be some corresponding input 
x so that if I plug in x, [SOUND] I get 

13
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:03,152
out y. 
This is the so-called intermediate value 

14
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:06,172
theorem. 
Let me write down a more precise 

15
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:10,370
definition now. 
So here's a statement of the intermediate 

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,390
value theorem. 
Theorem says the following. 

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,061
Suppose f of x is continuous in the 
closed interval between a and b, and that 

18
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:22,155
y is some point between f of a and f of 
b. 

19
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:27,900
Then, there's an x between a and b so 
that the function's output, when you plug 

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,725
in x, is equal to y. 
Here's a real world example, or if you 

21
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,810
like, a real world non-example of the 
intermediate value theorem. 

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,932
Is it possible for me to be standing here 
in one moment and over here in the next 

23
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:44,430
moment without actually occupying the 
points in between? 

24
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,360
What does the intermediate value theorem 
say? 

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,919
My position is a continuous function of 
time. 

26
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:57,167
So, if I'm standing here at say, time t 
equals zero seconds, and I'm over here at 

27
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:02,542
say, time equals three seconds, 
mustn't there be a time when I'm 

28
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:07,454
standing, say, right here? 
Yeah, maybe it's a time t equals two 

29
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,092
seconds. 
Who knows? 

30
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:16,552
What the intermediate value theorem says 
is that for a continuous function, all of 

31
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:23,284
the intermediate values are actually 
achieved at some point along the way. 

32
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:24,012
