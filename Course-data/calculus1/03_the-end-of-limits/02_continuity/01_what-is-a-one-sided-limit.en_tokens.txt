up
to
now
,
we
've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
limits
.
we
've
been
considering
f
(
x
)
when
x
is
close
to
but
not
equal
to
a.
let
's
refine
that
a
bit
now
.
instead
of
thinking
about
x
close
to
a.
i
'm
going
to
think
about
x
close
to
the
right
side
of
a
or
x
close
to
the
left
side
of
a.
super-sized
definition
.
so
we
say
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
from
the
right
,
i
'm
going
to
use
this
little
+
sign
to
mean
from
the
right
.
so
if
this
is
equal
to
l
,
it
means
that
f
(
x
)
is
as
close
as
you
want
to
l
,
this
is
just
like
before
,
provided
x
is
near
enough
a
on
the
right-hand
side
.
so
we
're
going
to
use
a
little
+
sign
to
denote
approaching
from
the
right-hand
side
.
now
we
're
going
to
play
a
same
game
for
approaching
from
the
left-hand
side
.
so
let
's
say
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
from
the
left-hand
side
is
equal
to
l
means
that
f
(
x
)
is
as
close
as
you
want
to
l
just
like
usual
,
provided
x
is
near
enough
a
on
the
left-hand
side
.
let
's
go
see
some
picture
of
this
at
the
blackboard
.
really
helps
to
see
a
graph
.
here
's
a
graph
of
a
made
up
function
that
i
'm
called
f
(
x
)
.
you
'll
note
that
f
(
x
)
has
some
issues
at
the
input
3.
there
's
an
empty
circle
here
and
a
filled-in
circle
here
so
if
i
plug
in
3
,
my
output
valley
is
2.
and
indeed
if
i
plug
in
numbers
that
are
just
a
little
bit
above
3
,
i
get
out
numbers
that
are
close
to
2.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
i
plug
numbers
that
are
a
little
bit
less
than
3
,
i
get
out
numbers
that
are
close
to
1.
we
can
summarize
our
observations
with
these
two
statements
.
the
first
is
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
three
from
the
right-hand
side
is
equal
to
2.
and
that
makes
sense
because
i
can
get
the
output
of
the
function
to
be
as
close
to
2
as
i
'd
like
if
i
'm
willing
to
evaluate
the
function
of
inputs
that
are
close
to
but
just
a
little
bit
bigger
than
3.
similarly
,
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
two
from
the
left-hand
side
is
equal
to
1.
we
think
back
in
the
graph
,
i
was
getting
outputs
that
are
close
to
one
if
i
evaluated
the
function
inputs
which
are
close
to
,
but
just
a
little
bit
less
,
than
3.
so
in
this
case
,
the
two
sided
limit
does
n't
exist
.
i
ca
n't
say
that
f
(
x
)
is
getting
close
to
anything
if
all
i
know
is
that
x
is
close
to
3
but
the
left
and
the
right
hand
limits
do
exist
.
i
can
say
that
f
(
x
)
is
getting
close
to
1.
if
x
approaches
3
from
the
left-hand
side
,
and
i
can
say
that
f
(
x
)
is
getting
close
to
2
if
x
approaches
3
from
the
right-hand
side
.
this
situation
comes
up
quite
a
bit
where
you
compute
and
you
find
that
the
right
and
the
left
hand
limits
exist
but
they
disagree
and
consequently
,
the
two
side
of
limit
does
n't
exist
.
i
can
summarize
it
like
this
.
if
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
from
the
right
,
is
different
than
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
from
the
left
,
then
the
two
sided
limit
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
does
not
exist
.
it
works
the
other
way
as
well
.
if
the
limit
from
the
right-hand
side
is
equal
to
the
limit
from
the
left-hand
side
,
let
's
call
our
common
value
l
,
then
the
two
sided
limit
,
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
,
no
+
or
-
.
so
this
is
just
the
usual
old
limit
.
then
this
limit
exists
and
it
's
equal
to
that
same
common
value
,
l.
the
homework
will
challenge
you
with
many
more
situations
of
one
sided
limits
.
