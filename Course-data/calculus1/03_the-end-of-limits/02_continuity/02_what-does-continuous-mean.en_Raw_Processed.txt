sound lets think back to friend 
square root function 
whats square root two 
well, square root two is 
whats square root 
awfully close 
a bit more, is 
really close to square root two 
whats square root 
well, also really close to 
square root two 
a bit more, is 
really close to 
point here is that nearby inputs 
producing nearby outputs 
lets try to see numbers 
graph square root 
function look like 
is this graph square root 
function 
take a look happens right here 
nearby inputs sent to 
nearby outputs 
inputs close to two 
say something a little bit less two 
something a little bit bigger 
two, sent to outputs that 
quite far apart 
numbers show that couldnt 
graph square root function 
graph square 
root function look like 
this is graph square 
root function looks like 
looks continuous, one nice curve 
in particular, nearby inputs give rise to 
nearby outputs 
lets try to capture concept 
continuity 
a bit precisely a picture 
graph 
heres sort a moral definition 
i mean i say f x is continuous 
a 
so morally i mean that inputs near a 
sent to outputs near f a 
this perspective, looks like 
function, f x equals square root 
x is continuous two inputs 
near two sent to outputs near 
square root two 
we make this intuition a little 
bit precise 
here is a precise definition, 
to say that f x is continuous a is 
to say that limit f x x 
approaches a is equal to f a 
think back to we mean limit, 
to say that limit f x equals f 
a is to say that i make f x 
close to f a you like long x 
is close enough to a 
thats really spirit 
continuity 
continuity is trying to say that nearby 
inputs sent to nearby outputs, 
this limit statement is capturing that 
sense 
saying that i make output 
close to output a long 
input is close to a 
this definitions pretty involved 
weve got to try to unpack this a bit 
really mean to say that 
limit f x equals f a x 
approaches a 
to make this statement i really need to 
know that f x is defined point 
a 
i cant talk f a unless i know 
that a is domain f 
talk limit f x i also 
need to know that limit f x 
x approaches a exists 
i need this to number so i 
talk equal to 
number 
well ive got two statements, 
makes sense to claim that 
limit f x x approaches a is 
equal to f a 
i make this third 
final statement, im really assuming that 
two preceding things hold, alright 
so definition continuity is a 
little bit subtle seems 
really three parts 
function to defined 
point 
limit to exist equal to 
number, i say that 
number, limit is equal to 
functions value 
so makes sense to talk 
function that point 
nothing weve done so far really captures 
idea that graph is a single 
curve, 
a single continuous curve 
weve always working a 
single point 
this is definition continuity 
single point a 
often we want to talk 
continuity a whole interval 
so well get rid this well make 
this solely a fancier definition 
to say that function is continuous 
a whole interval a to b is to say 
that points c in between a b 
so c is bigger a less b, 
so c is in interval a to b 
f x is continuous that point 
c 
so this is we mean we talk 
continuity a whole interval 

so thats definition open 
intervals 
closed intervals 
we to even a bit careful 
we talk continuity a closed 
interval, a b opposed to open 
interval a b 
so if we say that function is 
continuous closed interval a 
to b 
we mean that f x is continuous 
open interval a to b so in between a 
b 
happens a b 
well, limit f x x approaches 
a right hand side, is equal to f 
a 
limit f x x approaches b 
left hand side is equal to f 
b 
sound
