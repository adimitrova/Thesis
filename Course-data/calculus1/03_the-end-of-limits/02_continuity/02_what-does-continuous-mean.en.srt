00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,311
[SOUND] Let's think back to our friend 
the square root function. 

2
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:08,824
What's the square root of two? 
Well, the square root of two is about 

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:11,519
1.414. 
What's the square root of 2.01? 

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,157
It's awfully close. 
It's 1.417 and a bit more, which is 

5
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:19,872
really close to the square root of two. 
What's the square root of 1.99? 

6
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:23,510
Well, it's also really close to the 
square root of two. 

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,350
It's 1.410 and a bit more, which is 
really close to 1.414. 

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,832
The point here is that nearby inputs are 
producing nearby outputs. 

9
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:36,585
Let's try to see these numbers. 
What does the graph of the square root 

10
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:40,388
function look like? 
Is this the graph of the square root 

11
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:43,347
function? 
Take a look at what happens right here. 

12
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:46,416
Nearby inputs are not being sent to 
nearby outputs. 

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,388
Inputs very close to two. 
Say something a little bit less than two 

14
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:55,082
and something a little bit bigger than 
two, are being sent to outputs that are 

15
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:58,513
quite far apart. 
The numbers show that couldn't have been 

16
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:03,344
the graph of the square root function. 
But what does the graph for the square 

17
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:07,389
root function look like? 
This is what the graph for the square 

18
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:11,630
root function looks like. 
It looks continuous, it's one nice curve. 

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,283
In particular, nearby inputs give rise to 
nearby outputs. 

20
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,350
Let's try to capture the concept of 
continuity. 

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,022
A bit more precisely than just a picture 
on the graph. 

22
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:27,734
Here's sort of a moral definition of what 
I mean when I say f of x is continuous at 

23
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,658
a. 
So morally I mean that inputs near a are 

24
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:35,760
being sent to outputs near f of a. 
From this perspective, it looks like the 

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,341
function, F of X equals the square root 
of X is continuous at two because inputs 

26
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:45,736
near two are being sent to outputs near 
the square root of two. 

27
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:49,643
How do we make this intuition a little 
bit more precise? 

28
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:54,526
Here is a precise definition, 
to say that F of X is continuous at A is 

29
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:59,780
to say that the limit of F of X as X 
approaches A is equal to F of A. 

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,378
Now think back to what we mean by limit, 
to say that the limit f of x equals f of 

31
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:10,838
a is to say that I can make f of x as 
close to f of a as you like as long as x 

32
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:14,264
is close enough to a. 
But that's really the spirit of 

33
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,412
continuity. 
Continuity is trying to say that nearby 

34
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:22,164
inputs are sent to nearby outputs, and 
this limit statement is capturing that 

35
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:24,942
sense. 
It's saying that I can make the output 

36
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:28,645
close to the output at A as long as the 
input is close to A. 

37
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:33,027
This definition's pretty involved. 
We've got to try to unpack this a bit. 

38
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:37,717
What does it really mean to say that the 
limit of F of X equals F of A as X 

39
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:41,523
approaches A? 
To make this statement I really need to 

40
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,385
know that f of x is defined at the point 
a. 

41
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:49,320
I can't talk about f of a unless I know 
that a is the domain of f. 

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,912
Talk about the limit of f of x I also 
need to know that the limit of f of x as 

43
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:57,457
x approaches a exists. 
I need this to be some number so I can 

44
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,190
talk about it being equal to some other 
number. 

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,587
Well once I've got these two statements, 
then it makes sense to claim that the 

46
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:07,575
limit of F of X as X approaches A is 
equal to F of A. 

47
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:11,973
But before I can make this third and 
final statement, I'm really assuming that 

48
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:16,314
these two preceding things hold, alright. 
So the definition of continuity is a 

49
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:20,091
little bit more subtle than it seems. 
It's really these three parts. 

50
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:22,572
The function has to be defined at the 
point. 

51
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:26,801
The limit has to exist and be equal to 
some number, and then I can say that 

52
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,563
number, the limit is equal to the 
functions value. 

53
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,890
So it makes sense to talk about the 
function at that point. 

54
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,504
Nothing we've done so far really captures 
the idea that the graph is a single 

55
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,398
curve, 
a single continuous curve. 

56
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:42,297
We've always just been working at a 
single point. 

57
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:45,787
This is the definition of continuity at 
the single point A. 

58
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:49,870
But often we want to talk about 
continuity on a whole interval at once. 

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,948
So we'll get rid of this and we'll make 
this solely a fancier definition. 

60
00:03:54,948 --> 00:04:00,584
To say that the function is continuous on 
a whole interval from A to B is to say 

61
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:06,081
that for all points C in between A and B 
so C is bigger than A and less than B, 

62
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:11,020
so C is in the interval A to B. 
Then F of X is continuous at that point 

63
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,415
C. 
So this is what we mean when we talk 

64
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,158
about continuity on a whole interval at 
once. 

65
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,841
So that's the definition for open 
intervals. 

66
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,864
What about closed intervals? 
We have to be even a bit more careful 

67
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:27,620
when we talk about continuity on a closed 
interval, A B as opposed to the open 

68
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,485
interval A B. 
So if we say that the function is 

69
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:33,289
continuous on the closed interval from A 
to B. 

70
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:38,349
We mean that F of X is continuous on the 
open interval from A to B so in between A 

71
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:40,910
and B. 
But then what happens at A and at B? 

72
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:50,184
Well, the limit of F of X as X approaches 
A from the right hand side, is equal to F 

73
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:55,500
of A. 
And the limit of F of X as X approaches B 

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,364
from the left hand side is equal to F of 
B. 

75
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,269
