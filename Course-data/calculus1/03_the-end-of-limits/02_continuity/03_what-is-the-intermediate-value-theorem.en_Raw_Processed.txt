sound so far, weve selling 
continuity something nearness 
continuous functions preserve nearness, 
so nearby points gets nearby points 
continuity isnt small 
changes become small changes 
continuity consequences 
global structure function well 
heres one 
ive graphed random looking 
continuous function 
ive picked a couple input points, 
input point a, 
input point b 
here is point a, f a, 
heres point b, f b 
yaxis ive got value f 
a value f b 
now, in between f a f b, ive 
picked random value 
im calling y 
heres a consequence continuity 
there to corresponding input 
x so that if i plug in x, sound i get 
y 
this is socalled intermediate value 
theorem 
let write a precise 
definition 
so heres a statement intermediate 
value theorem 
theorem says following 
suppose f x is continuous in 
closed interval between a b, that 
y is point between f a f 
b 
then, theres an x between a b so 
that functions output, you plug 
in x, is equal to y 
heres a real world example, if you 
like, a real world nonexample 
intermediate value theorem 
is possible to standing here 
in one moment here in next 
moment without actually occupying 
points in between 
intermediate value theorem 
say 
position is a continuous function 
time 
so, if im standing here say, time 
equals zero seconds, im here 
say, time equals three seconds, 
mustnt there a time im 
standing, say, right here 
yeah, maybe a time equals two 
seconds 
knows 
intermediate value theorem says 
is that a continuous function, 
intermediate values actually 
achieved point along way 
sound
