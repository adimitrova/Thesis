music so, i get a number like 
square root two 
square root two is irrational 
so, i going to figure 
approximately equal to 
well, turns that 
approximately, you know, a bit 

would ever figure that 
would i know that thats 
approximately value square 
root two 
lets use intermediate value theorem 
to try to pull 
i want to use intermediate value 
theorem to approximate square root 
two 
to that, im going to use this 
function, 
fx x 
notice something this function 
this function is equal to zero x is 
square root 
is that 
f square root is squared 
two squared, is two, minus two, 
is zero 
so, if im trying to approximate 
square root , im going to think 
this, is that im going to look 
a positive value, that i plug 
this function to make a square root 
zero 
i going to find a value 
you know, good thing this 
function is that continuous 
then, i plug in values, like 
f 
now, whats f 
one squared minus two thats 
minus one 
i plot that graph right 
here, this point right here 
take a look at, say, f 
f would two squared minus two, 
is two 
i plot that graph, right 
here 
, 
now, f is a continuous function 
one, negative 
two, positive 
so, a continuous function 
negative one positive 
two 
intermediate value theorem, there 
must a point in between 
functions value is equal to zero 
you see that graph 
looking that point 
that is square root two this 
graph crosses xaxis, 
positive xaxis 
thats point that looking 
for, 
right 
intermediate value theorem promises 
theres a value in between 
functions value equals zero 
i see that there must a 
point graph 
now, i know that that value is 
between one two 
i better 
i cut this interval between one 
two in half i get that f 
well, squared is is 
sound alright 
so, thats, say, this point graph 
now, i know 
i know that squared two, is 
this graph crosses xaxis, is 
between one, function is 
negative , function is 
positive 
i better, 
alright 
i pick point 
lets brave pick 
if i plug in , well, squared is 
so, squared is , 
that makes this , 
alright 
this is barely xaxis 
i plot that point here 
now, i know that square root 
two, positive input to this function, 
is equal to zero, 
well, must between 
functions value is 
negative functions value 
is positive 
so, this is so bad 
i mean, we, we could this a few 
calculations blackboard 
lets, lets bring sort 
computation device so we try to get 
an even better approximation to 
square root two 
so here, ive got a function 
function is fx x 
you see that if i plug zero 
function, i get 
is 
now, this is a physical function 
ive got this knob here i spin 
this knob, functions input value 
changes 
so, example, if i spin to 
f, f, thats negative 
thats right if i take a half 
squared, i get a quarter, a quarter 
minus two is 
now, i could spin input to one 
f is is 
f, well, squared is , 
is 
now, this is positive i could wheel 
back a little bit 
i see that i get to , 
functions output is negative 
then, i could increase functions 
input a bit 
oh, functions output is positive 
again, f 
then, i could decrease value a 
little bit 
oh, 
now, functions output value is 
negative that would increase 
output value a little bit 
oh, 
now, functions output is positive 
i could decrease input a bit 
now, functions output is negative, 
could increase input a little bit 
now, positive, could decrease 
input a little bit 
now, negative 
now, look happened, 
right 
whats going 
im looking function fx x 
im walking back forth across 
point this function is equal to 
zero 
i walk to left to 
right, function is positive 
function is negative 
im getting closer closer to a, 
to actual place function is 
equal to zero is 
awfully close to square root 
two 
if you think square root two 
square subtract two, you get 
zero 
we saw knob that i 
turning is actually an incredibly general 
technique figuring a 
continuous function crosses xaxis 
we efficiently 
lets take a look we might this 
a little bit carefully 
here, ive drawn a graph random 
looking continuous function ive 
labeled points along xaxis 
imagine that we couldnt see this whole 
graph 
imagine that thing you 
is interrogate this function 
you ask this function input 
point, you positive negative 
trying to figure where, 
approximately, this continuous function 
crosses xaxis 
looking a zero this 
continuous function 
might game begin 
ill let begin asking function, 
you positive negative zero 
function is positive zero 
then, maybe id ask sixteen 
sixteen, is this function positive 
negative 
id see function is negative 
functions value is negative 
sixteen 
a continuous function 
functions value zero is positive 
functions value sixteen is 
negative, i know that theres a zero in 
between 
theres point in between that if i 
plug function, i get zero 

now, i could cut that interval in half 
i could plug in eight i could ask 
function f, you positive 
negative 
function f, value 
function eight is positive 
now, look 
i know functions value eight is 
positive, functions value sixteen 
is negative 
so, intermediate value theorem, 
there must a value in between, right 
there, functions value is 
zero 
now, i could take that interval 
cut in half 
i could take a look twelve, is 
exactly between eight sixteen 
i could ask function, 
f,, you positive negative 
functions value twelve is 
negative 
sound so now, i know 
intermediate value theorem, function 
zero zero this function must land 
between eight twelve i could cut 
that interval in half 
i could look ten, i could ask 
function, 
well, if i plug in ten, you positive 
negative 
functions value ten is 
negative 
now, i know that zero must land 
between eight ten, 
functions value eight is positive 
functions value ten is negative, 
so there must a zero in between, a 
point functions value is equal 
to zero 
now, i could cut that interval between 
eight ten in half 
i could look nine i could ask 
function, nine, you positive 
negative if i plug in nine, looks 
like function is positive 
that means that a value that i 
plug function to make output 
zero lies between nine ten 
this is really quite remarkable 
i, i, i could cut interval between 
nine ten half see if 
between nine ten 
i could keep this every time 
im getting a little bit precision 
to exact value input that 
would make function zero 
really neat thing this is 
that i could tried 
values between zero sixteen 
i could plugged seventeen 
numbers function to figure 
this this clever 
cutting in half method, this bisection 
method, i managed to ask six 
questions, 
right 
i asked functions value zero 
sixteen, eight twelve, ten 
nine, asking six 
questions, i able to narrow a 
region a zero resided 
now, thats pretty quite efficient, much 
better asking seventeen questions 
so, this is a general technique 
figuring zeroes continuous 
functions lie 
i encourage you to pick favorite 
function see if you approximate a 
root, a zero that function
