music faucet a slow leak 
dripping 
much water is wasted 
lets find 
now, im going to start timer see 
full measuring cup is after, say, 
three minutes 
music so, three minutes 
dripping, drip put approximately 
milliliters water this 
measuring cup 
here, i a cube that holds one liter 
liquid 
long would take dripping 
faucet that drips milliliters per 
three minutes to fill this cube that 
holds milliliters 
music alright 
minutes 
lets see 
looks like almost exactly 
milliliters 
so, weve collected data now, 
lets see if we figure something 
alright 
here time time water 
three minutes, we found that 
milliliters water inside 
measuring cup 
this tells us that water is entering 
measuring cup a rate 
milliliters three minutes, is 
equal to approximately sound 
milliliters per minute 
later, we checked we found that 
minutes, there 
milliliters in cube this time 
well, this tells us since going here 
to here, we a difference 
minutes going here to here, we 
a difference milliliters, 
this gives us a new rate 
says, that we milliliters per 
minutes thats approximately 
milliliters per minute 
aha 
this looks like linear growth 
i know that slopes slightly 
different a, a small 
difference that if we plot it, 
linear 
now, time is there one liter 
water in cube 
that would , sound milliliters 
time 
so, we use variable 
there 
we to solve following equation 
we want to approximately 
well, whats between 
, okay 
ha, ha 
so now, thats saying, 
is equal to , five, this is 
approximately minutes 
minutes is hours, minutes 
music 
this point, hours minutes 
gone 
if we check cube, music we see 
right a , milliliters 
music
