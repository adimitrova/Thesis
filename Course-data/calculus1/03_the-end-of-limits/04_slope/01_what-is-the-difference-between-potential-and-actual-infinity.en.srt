00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,333
[MUSIC] Let's consider this limit. 
The lim (2x-x), as X → ∞ = ∞. 

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:12,019
That's a true statement, but there's two 
totally different ways to think about 

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:18,680
this statement, and it really hinges on 
the distinction between potential and 

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,901
actual ∞. 
To have a potentially infinite pile of 

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:26,530
fish is to have an endless supply of 
fish, as many fish as you'd like to have, 

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,302
and that sense really goes will with how 
we're thinking about infinity in these 

7
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:33,989
limits. 
To say the limit of 2x minus x equals 

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,844
infinity, as x approaches infinity, is to 
say that I can make 2x minus x as big as 

9
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:40,927
I like, as long as x. 
Big enough. 

10
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:45,697
Contrast that with actual infinity. 
To have an actually infinite pile of fish 

11
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:50,474
would be to have, right now, a pile of 
fish that contains infinitely many fish 

12
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:53,995
at this very moment. 
Is it possible to combine that way of 

13
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:59,076
thinking with infinity, with these kind 
of limit statements? Let me share with 

14
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:02,965
you a fable, to see one of the paradoxes 
that results. 

15
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:08,082
Once upon a time, there was a house. 
I lived in that house, with my cat. 

16
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:13,548
And we lived, near a lake, and this lake 
is full of fish, so every day we went 

17
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,427
fishing. 
And each day I caught two fish. 

18
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:19,402
The first day I caught fish labelled 1 
and 2. 

19
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:24,477
Now, my cat prefers eating the lowest 
number of fish in our stockpile, so my 

20
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:29,127
cat ate the fish numbered 1. 
The next day, I went fishing again, and I 

21
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:33,727
caught fish labelled 3 and 4. 
And my pet, still preferring to eat the 

22
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,733
lowest numbered fish. 
Eats fish number 2. 

23
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:42,423
Another day another fishing expedition, I 
go fishing again, I get 2 more fish, 

24
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:48,057
label 5 and 6, my cat preferring to eat 
the lowest number fish in our stock pile 

25
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:51,996
eats fish number 3. 
I go fishing the next day and I get 2 

26
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:57,362
more fish, fish label 7 and 8, my cat 
preferring to eat the lowest numbered 

27
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:00,552
fish in our stock pile eats fish number 
4. 

28
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:05,091
And so it goes forever. 
Each day our stockpile gets bigger. 

29
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,609
There's more fish in my pile every single 
day. 

30
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:12,227
And yet, at the end of time, do any fish 
remain. 

31
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:18,322
On the Nth day my cat ate the Nth fish. 
So which fish survives my cat's appetite? 

32
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:22,925
Human beings want to understand infinity, 
but reasoning about actual infinity is 

33
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:26,176
liable to walk us straight into those 
kinds of paradoxes. 

34
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,742
Instead, limits by focusing our attention 
on potential infinity provide a way to 

35
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:34,092
reason about infinity that avoid those 
kinds of paradoxes. 

36
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:44,187
[MUSIC] It provides a way for mere human 
beings to think about infinity in a 

37
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:44,187
precise way.
