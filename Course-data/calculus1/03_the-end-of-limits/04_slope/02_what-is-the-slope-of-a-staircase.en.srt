00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,729
[MUSIC] Hello. 
I'm at the Knowlton School of 

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:11,199
Architecture at the Ohio State 
University. 

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,486
And today, we're going to measure the 
slope of some staircases, namely, this 

4
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:27,300
staircase here and this even larger 
staircase. 

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,490
You may think that this larger staircase 
is steeper than this staircase because, 

6
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:43,570
well, this staircase is harder to climb. 
But let's actually find out. 

7
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:50,999
And we're going to find out by measuring 
how far the staircase goes up by how wide 

8
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:55,829
each step is. 
When I measure this step, I see that it 

9
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,887
goes over twelve inches and it rises 
about six and a quarter inches. 

10
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:07,809
On the other hand, we have this larger 
staircase here. 

11
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:14,674
Let's see what its slope is. 
So, when I measure, I get 36 inches for 

12
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:20,229
the width of each step. 
On the other hand, [SOUND] I find that 

13
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:26,331
the height of each step is about 18-3/4 
inches. 

14
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:32,160
Now, that we've made the measurements, 
let's go compute the slope. 

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:45,268
So, we've measured our stairs and we 
found out that the small steps went up by 

16
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:54,064
6.25 inches and they were 12 inches wide, 
okay? 

17
00:01:54,064 --> 00:02:07,240
This gives us a slope for the small steps 
of 6.25 all over twelve. 

18
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,912
But there were also large steps. 
Let's draw those in. 

19
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:17,226
Here we go. 
So, this was one of the large steps and 

20
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:23,914
then, we had another one. 
It goes off and it builds, it climbs over 

21
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,571
there. 
It goes down like this. 

22
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:29,228
This is a large step. 
Alright. 

23
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:35,118
The height of the large step was this 
place right here. 

24
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:44,060
18.75 inches, 
that's the height of the large step. 

25
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:54,779
And the width of the large step was 36 
inches. 

26
00:02:54,779 --> 00:03:11,680
Okay, great. So, the slope of the large 
steps is 18.75 all over 36. 

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,919
These two slopes are the same, because we 
can simplify, we can reduce this fraction 

28
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:28,159
to be dividing the numerator by three and 
dividing the denominator by three, we get 

29
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,987
6.25 / 12. 
And we can see, if we connect the tips of 

30
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:41,415
these stairs with a line or this makes a 
line of the desired slope and see how the 

31
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:46,250
large stairs and the small stairs all 
meet at the corner of this line. 

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,147
The fact that the staircase with the 
large steps and the staircase with the 

33
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:56,371
small steps have exactly the same slope 
is evidenced by the fact that they have 

34
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,963
the same railing. 
There's the railing for the staircase 

35
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:04,991
with the large steps and here's the 
railing for the staircase with the small 

36
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,864
steps. 
And they're exactly at the same angle. 

37
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:12,958
So, we've seen that the staircase with 
the larger steps and the staircase with 

38
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,550
the smaller steps actually have exactly 
the same slope. 

39
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,858
Now, let's use the slope to estimate how 
tall the staircase is after you've gone a 

40
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:27,140
certain distance in the horizontal 
direction. 

41
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,129
How high up am I now? 
Here, you can see that we have a tape 

42
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:38,496
measure where we're measuring the width 
or the horizontal distance that I 

43
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:44,518
traveled here on the staircase. 
And if we get to the point where I was 

44
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,647
standing, we'll find out that it's about 
23 feet. 

45
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,777
Now, how high was I standing when I was 
up there? 

46
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:58,541
So, now that we've made our calculation, 
let's check our calculation. 

47
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:04,809
Okay. Now, we have a question. 
We went to a certain part on the 

48
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:07,929
staircase, 
say, right here. 

49
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,610
And then we measured. 
We, we, we, we marked, 

50
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:23,084
we had a point in mind and we measured 
the distance on the ground to that point. 

51
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:28,559
We found out that it was 23 feet, 
okay? 

52
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:38,318
So, if you remember, the slope of a 
staircase was 6.25 / 12, which is 

53
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:48,504
approximately 0.52. 
We want to know this height, x. 

54
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:54,134
So, we went x / 23 to be approximately 
0.52. 

55
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,376
Solve for x. 
Multiply both sides by 23 and we get x is 

56
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:13,603
approximately 0.52 times 23. 
0.52 times 23 is 11.96. 

57
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:23,800
So, x is approximately 12 feet. 
Now, let's go check our answer. 

58
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:44,945
So here we are, checking our measurement. 
[MUSIC] And I can see, it's almost 

59
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:50,775
exactly twelve feet.
