1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,258
[MUSIC] The faucet has a slow leak. 
It's dripping. 

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:14,072
How much water is being wasted? 
Let's find out. 

3
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:25,626
Now, I'm going to start the timer and see 
how full the measuring cup is after, say, 

4
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:34,980
three minutes. 
[MUSIC] So, after three minutes of 

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:49,735
dripping, the drip has put approximately 
13 milliliters of water into this 

6
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:54,245
measuring cup. 
Here, I have a cube that holds one liter 

7
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:58,086
of liquid. 
How long would it take our dripping 

8
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:06,149
faucet that drips 13 milliliters per 
three minutes to fill this cube that 

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:14,492
holds 1000 milliliters? 
[MUSIC] Alright. 

10
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:25,616
It's been about 90 minutes. 
Let's see where we're at. 

11
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:33,475
It looks like almost exactly 400 
milliliters. 

12
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:41,545
So, we've collected some data and now, 
let's see if we can figure something out. 

13
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:51,101
Alright. 
Here at time and time and water. 

14
00:01:51,101 --> 00:02:03,765
After three minutes, we found that 13 
milliliters of water are inside the 

15
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:16,292
measuring cup. 
This tells us that the water is entering 

16
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:26,686
the measuring cup at a rate of 13 
milliliters for three minutes, which is 

17
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:34,160
equal to or approximately [SOUND] 4.3 
milliliters per minute. 

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,758
Later, we checked it and we found that 
after 90 minutes, there were 400 

19
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:56,181
milliliters in the cube this time. 
Well, this tells us since going from here 

20
00:02:56,181 --> 00:03:05,020
to here, we have a difference of 87 
minutes and going from here to here, we 

21
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,426
have a difference of 387 milliliters, 
this gives us a new rate. 

22
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:24,012
It says, that we have 387 milliliters per 
87 minutes and that's approximately 4.4 

23
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:28,287
milliliters per minute. 
Aha. 

24
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:34,456
This looks like it's linear growth. 
I know that the slopes are slightly 

25
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:40,886
different but such a, such a small 
difference that if we plot it, it should 

26
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:45,143
be linear. 
Now, at what time is there one liter of 

27
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:49,401
water in the cube? 
That would be 1,000 [SOUND] milliliters. 

28
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:53,658
At what time? 
So, we should use t for the variable 

29
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:59,500
there. 
We have to solve the following equation. 

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:08,024
We want 1000 / t to be approximately 
well, what's between 4.3 and 4.4? 

31
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:14,260
4.35, okay? 
Ha, ha. 

32
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:30,614
So now, that's the same as saying, 
t is equal to 1,000 / 4.35 five, this is 

33
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:47,153
approximately 230 minutes. 
230 minutes is 3 hours, 50 minutes. 

34
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,620
[MUSIC] 

35
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:59,067
At this point, 3 hours and 50 minutes has 
gone by. 

36
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:12,614
If we check the cube, [MUSIC] we see it's 
right at a 1,000 milliliters. 

37
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,040
