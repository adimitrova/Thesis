music lets consider this limit 
lim xx, x 
thats a true statement, theres two 
totally different ways to think 
this statement, really hinges 
distinction between potential 
actual 
to a potentially infinite pile 
fish is to an endless supply 
fish, many fish youd like to have, 
that sense really goes will 
thinking infinity in 
limits 
to say limit x minus x equals 
infinity, x approaches infinity, is to 
say that i make x minus x big 
i like, long x 
big enough 
contrast that actual infinity 
to an actually infinite pile fish 
would to have, right now, a pile 
fish that contains infinitely many fish 
this moment 
is possible to combine that way 
thinking infinity, kind 
limit statements let share 
you a fable, to see one paradoxes 
that results 
upon a time, there a house 
i lived in that house, cat 
we lived, near a lake, this lake 
is full fish, so every day we went 
fishing 
day i caught two fish 
first day i caught fish labelled 

now, cat prefers eating lowest 
number fish in stockpile, so 
cat ate fish numbered 
next day, i went fishing again, i 
caught fish labelled 
pet, still preferring to eat 
lowest numbered fish 
eats fish number 
another day another fishing expedition, i 
go fishing again, i get fish, 
label , cat preferring to eat 
lowest number fish in stock pile 
eats fish number 
i go fishing next day i get 
fish, fish label , cat 
preferring to eat lowest numbered 
fish in stock pile eats fish number 
so goes forever 
day stockpile gets bigger 
theres fish in pile every single 
day 
yet, end time, fish 
remain 
nth day cat ate nth fish 
so fish survives cats appetite 
human beings want to understand infinity, 
reasoning actual infinity is 
liable to walk us straight 
kinds paradoxes 
instead, limits focusing attention 
potential infinity provide a way to 
reason infinity that avoid 
kinds paradoxes 
music provides a way mere human 
beings to think infinity in a 
precise way
