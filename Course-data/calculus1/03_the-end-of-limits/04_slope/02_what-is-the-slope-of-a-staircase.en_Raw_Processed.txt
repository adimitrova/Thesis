music hello 
im knowlton school 
architecture ohio state 
university 
today, going to measure 
slope staircases, namely, this 
staircase here this even larger 
staircase 
you may think that this larger staircase 
is steeper this staircase because, 
well, this staircase is harder to climb 
lets actually find 
going to find measuring 
far staircase goes wide 
step is 
i measure this step, i see that 
goes twelve inches rises 
six a quarter inches 
hand, we this larger 
staircase here 
lets see slope is 
so, i measure, i get inches 
width step 
hand, sound i find that 
height step is 
inches 
now, that weve made measurements, 
lets go compute slope 
so, weve measured stairs we 
found that small steps went 
inches inches wide, 
okay 
this gives us a slope small steps 
twelve 
there also large steps 
lets draw in 
here we go 
so, this one large steps 
then, we another one 
goes builds, climbs 
there 
goes like this 
this is a large step 
alright 
height large step this 
place right here 
inches, 
thats height large step 
width large step 
inches 
okay, great so, slope large 
steps is 
two slopes same, we 
simplify, we reduce this fraction 
to dividing numerator three 
dividing denominator three, we get 
we see, if we connect tips 
stairs a line this makes a 
line desired slope see 
large stairs small stairs 
meet corner this line 
fact that staircase 
large steps staircase 
small steps exactly slope 
is evidenced fact that 
railing 
theres railing staircase 
large steps heres 
railing staircase small 
steps 
theyre exactly angle 
so, weve seen that staircase 
larger steps staircase 
smaller steps actually exactly 
slope 
now, lets use slope to estimate 
tall staircase is youve gone a 
certain distance in horizontal 
direction 
high i 
here, you see that we a tape 
measure measuring width 
horizontal distance that i 
traveled here staircase 
if we get to point i 
standing, well find that 
feet 
now, high i standing i 
there 
so, that weve made calculation, 
lets check calculation 
okay now, we a question 
we went to a certain part 
staircase, 
say, right here 
we measured 
we, we, we, we marked, 
we a point in mind we measured 
distance ground to that point 
we found that feet, 
okay 
so, if you remember, slope a 
staircase , is 
approximately 
we want to know this height, x 
so, we went x to approximately 
solve x 
multiply sides we get x is 
approximately times 
times is 
so, x is approximately feet 
now, lets go check answer 
so here we are, checking measurement 
music i see, almost 
exactly twelve feet
