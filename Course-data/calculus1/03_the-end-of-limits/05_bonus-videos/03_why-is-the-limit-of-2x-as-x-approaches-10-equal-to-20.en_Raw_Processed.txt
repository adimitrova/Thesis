music heres a claim 
limit x x approaches , is 
now, to justify this claim using an 
epsilon delta argument i to able 
to prove that delta every epsilon, 
alright youre going to demand that x 
within epsilon 
im going to satisfy demand 
saying x is within number delta 
sound so proof, let epsilon bigger 
zero 
i dont know small a number epsilon 
youre going to choose 
im going to set delta equal epsilon 
two 
im going to check that this value 
delta will work to satisfy demand 
involving epsilon 
so, if zero is less x is less 
delta, right if x is within delta 
, if you multiply , we see 
that x is less delta 
whats delta delta is epsilon 
delta is epsilon 
so then, times absolute value 
x is less delta, is 
epsilon sound so, times 
absolute value x, thats 
absolute value x , thats 
less epsilon 
so look weve shown, 
alright epsilon bigger zero, a 
corresponding value delta is going to 
epsilon then, i verify 
that if x is within , is within delta 
, x is within epsilon 
thats exactly means to say 
that limit x is x 
approaches 
every epsilon, theres delta so 
that whenever x is within delta , 
function x is within epsilon 
you imagine trying to this 
functions, right 
ill let you try that 
you try that in exercise included
