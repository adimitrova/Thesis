music so, mean to say that 
limit x, x approaches , is 
strictly speaking, means that you 
make x close you want to 
making x sufficiently close to , 
talking in that way a little 
bit confusing 
so im going to sort format here 
as, if a dialogue alright so 
youre going to make sort demand 
youre going to demand that x close 
to 
maybe youre going to demand that x 
within 
alright so that means youre, youre 
asking that x between , 
is a less , 
, is a 
so youre going to make demand that 
output close to i to 
satisfy demand making x 
sufficiently close to 
now, that mean im going to 
satisfy demand stipulating that x 
within small distance 
so, close is sufficiently close 
well, in this case, lets make lets make 
x within a see 
happens 
so x is within a that 
means that x sound is bigger 
sound smaller sound 
if x is bigger , x is 
bigger , if x is smaller 
, x squared is smaller 
sound 
and, look numbers, 
, that is bigger sound , 
here, , thats smaller 

so notice happened here 
if x is within a , x is 
between 
if x is between , 
x is between , 
if x is bigger , 
bigger , 
if x is smaller , 
smaller 
so that means demanding that x within 
a , in fact, forces x to 
between 
in words, forces x to 
within a 
so if demand is that x squared 
within a , i satisfy that 
demand simply requiring x to within 
a 
now, i thing 
demands that you might make 
you might demanded that x 
within a i that 
well 
so that would mean that x is between 

well, if x, if you want x to 
between , im going to 
to make condition close x 
to to 
so lets try a 
so if x is within a , that 
means that x, itll between 
if x is bigger , x 
is bigger sound 
if x , x 
now, look numbers, , 
that is bigger , 
, that is smaller 
so if x is within a , that 
means x is between 
that means that x is between 
, a little bit 
that makes x be, between , 
is exactly you demanded 
so this is structure of, 
means to say that limit x is 
x approaches means matter 
close you demand x to to , even 
if this epsilon replaced a 
tiny number 
id able to find distance, 
number to put here, so that long 
x is that close to , x is 
close you wanted to number 
so exercise, asks you to take a 
look another situation like this to 
see if you figure number to put 
here to satisfy condition that 
someone might make you
