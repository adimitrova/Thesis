here
's
a
claim
.
the
limit
of
2x
as
x
approaches
10
,
is
now
,
to
justify
this
claim
using
an
epsilon
delta
argument
i
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
delta
for
every
epsilon
,
alright
?
you
're
going
to
demand
that
2x
be
within
epsilon
of
20.
i
'm
going
to
satisfy
your
demand
by
saying
x
is
within
some
number
delta
of
[

]
so
proof
,
let
epsilon
be
bigger
than
zero
.
i
do
n't
know
how
small
a
number
epsilon
you
're
going
to
choose
.
i
'm
going
to
set
delta
equal
epsilon
over
two
.
i
'm
going
to
check
now
that
this
value
of
delta
will
work
to
satisfy
your
demand
involving
epsilon
.
so
,
if
zero
is
less
than
x
-
10
is
less
than
delta
,
right
?
if
x
is
within
delta
of
10
,
then
if
you
multiply
by
2
,
we
see
that
2
*
x-10
is
less
than
2
delta
.
but
what
's
2
delta
?
delta
is
epsilon
over
2
delta
is
just
epsilon
.
so
then
,
2
times
the
absolute
value
of
x-10
is
less
than
2
delta
,
which
is
epsilon
.
[

and
so
,
2
times
the
absolute
value
of
x-10
,
that
's
the
absolute
value
of
2x
-
20
,
and
that
's
less
than
epsilon
.
so
look
at
what
we
've
shown
,
alright
?
some
epsilon
bigger
than
zero
,
a
corresponding
value
of
delta
is
going
to
be
epsilon
over
2.
and
then
,
i
verify
that
if
x
is
within
10
,
is
within
delta
of
10
,
then
2x
is
within
epsilon
of
20.
and
that
's
exactly
what
it
means
to
say
that
the
limit
of
2x
is
20
as
x
approaches
10.
for
every
epsilon
,
there
's
some
delta
so
that
whenever
x
is
within
delta
of
10
,
then
the
function
2x
is
within
epsilon
of
you
can
imagine
trying
to
do
this
with
other
functions
,
right
?
but
i
'll
let
you
try
that
.
you
can
try
that
in
the
exercise
included
below
.
