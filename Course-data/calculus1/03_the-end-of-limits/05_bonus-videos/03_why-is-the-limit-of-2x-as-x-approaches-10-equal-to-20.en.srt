[MUSIC] Here's a claim. 
The limit of 2x as x approaches 10, is 

2
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:09,792
20. 
Now, to justify this claim using an 

3
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:18,031
epsilon delta argument I have to be able 
to prove that delta for every epsilon, 

4
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:22,334
alright? You're going to demand that 2x 
be within epsilon of 20. 

5
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:27,570
I'm going to satisfy your demand by 
saying x is within some number delta of 

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,628
10. 
[SOUND] So proof, let epsilon be bigger 

7
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:33,867
than zero. 
I don't know how small a number epsilon 

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,938
you're going to choose. 
I'm going to set delta equal epsilon over 

9
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:43,501
two. 
I'm going to check now that this value of 

10
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:50,326
delta will work to satisfy your demand 
involving epsilon. 

11
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:55,882
So, if zero is less than x - 10 is less 
than delta, right? If x is within delta 

12
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:04,102
of 10, then if you multiply by 2, we see 
that 2 * x-10 is less than 2 delta. 

13
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:09,381
But what's 2 delta? Delta is epsilon over 
2. 

14
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:15,334
2 delta is just epsilon. 
So then, 2 times the absolute value of 

15
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:20,656
x-10 is less than 2 delta, which is 
epsilon. [SOUND] And so, 2 times the 

16
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:27,080
absolute value of x-10, that's the 
absolute value of 2x - 20, and that's 

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,528
less than epsilon. 
So look at what we've shown, 

18
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:37,732
alright? Some epsilon bigger than zero, a 
corresponding value of delta is going to 

19
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:43,007
be epsilon over 2. And then, I verify 
that if x is within 10, is within delta 

20
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:48,522
of 10, then 2x is within epsilon of 20. 
And that's exactly what it means to say 

21
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:51,702
that the limit of 2x is 20 as x 
approaches 10. 

22
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:57,592
For every epsilon, there's some delta so 
that whenever x is within delta of 10, 

23
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:02,262
then the function 2x is within epsilon of 
20. 

24
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:08,797
You can imagine trying to do this with 
other functions, right? 

25
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:15,497
But I'll let you try that. 
You can try that in the exercise included 

26
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,055
below.
