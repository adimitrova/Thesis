00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,279
[MUSIC] So now we learn what the official 
definition of limit is. 

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,061
To say that the limit of f(x) = L as x 
approaches a, means the following. 

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,768
It means that for all epsilon bigger than 
zero, this backwards three is the real 

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:19,084
number epsilon or the Greek letter, a 
variable. So for all epsilon greater than 

5
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:23,426
zero, there's a delta greater than zero, 
this is the Greek letter delta. 

6
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:27,842
So, for all epsilon greater than zero, 
there's a delta greater than zero. 

7
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:33,037
So that if, this, if the absolute value 
of x - a is between zero and delta, then, 

8
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:36,702
the absolute value of f(x) - L is less 
than epsilon. 

9
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:41,282
When you say it like that, I think it's 
really hard to see how this has any 

10
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:46,342
relationship to what a more intuitive 
description of this limit statement might 

11
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,952
be. 
I mean, what's this trying to get at? 

12
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:54,307
It's trying to say f(x) is as close as I 
want to L by making x sufficiently close 

13
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:57,260
to a. 
So, how, how to reconcile those, those 

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,307
two perspectives, right? How does this 
have anything to do with things being 

15
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:05,210
close. 
The key, take a look at this absolute 

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,868
value of the difference, 
right? 

17
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,222
The absolute value of x - a is the 
distance between x and a. 

18
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:16,936
So to say that the distance between x and 
a is between zero and delta is to say 

19
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:22,596
that x is within delta of a, alright? The 
distance from x to a is less than delta. 

20
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:27,707
And to say that the distance between x 
and a is bigger than zero is just to say 

21
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:33,252
that the distance between x and, and a, 
you know, isn't zero, right, x isn't a. 

22
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:38,431
So I can rewrite that, maybe in a little 
bit easier way. 

23
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:46,190
[SOUND] So instead of saying that, it's 
the same thing to say, if x is not equal 

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:54,060
to a, so the absolute value of x - a 
isn't zero, and x is within delta of a. 

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,647
So the distance between x and a is delta. 
And I can do the same thing to this 

26
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:03,812
absolute value of a difference, alright? 
The absolute value of f(x) - L, that's 

27
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:08,491
the distance, between f(x) and L. 
And the sum of the distance between f(x) 

28
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:14,243
and L is less than epsilon. 
Well, that just means that f(x) is within 

29
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:17,813
epsilon of L. 
So, I'll rewrite that as that. [SOUND] 

30
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:21,517
Here we go. 
[SOUND] Then f(x) is within epsilon of L. 

31
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:28,314
So, I think when, when you write it like 
this, it makes a little bit more sense, 

32
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,317
right? 
To say that the limit of f(x) = L as x 

33
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:36,247
approaches a, 
means that for all numbers epsilon, 

34
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,887
epsilon is measuring how close I want 
f(x) to L, 

35
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:45,922
then, there's some corresponding number 
delta, which is how close x has to be to 

36
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:49,197
a. 
So that whenever x is that close, delta, 

37
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:53,624
within delta of a, 
then f(x) is really within epsilon of L. 

38
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:58,572
And to say that the limit of f(x) = L 
means that no matter which epsilon I 

39
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:03,896
choose, there's some corresponding delta, 
so that whenever x is within delta of a, 

40
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:08,056
then f(x) is within epsilon of L. 
Now, how this actually gets played out 

41
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:12,425
in, in more concrete situations can be, 
you know, kind of complicated, but this 

42
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:17,297
is really the official definition of what 
it means to say that the limit of f(x) 

43
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,910
equals L as x goes to a. [MUSIC] And 
we're going to be trying to unpack this 

44
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:34,121
definition to see what it might mean in 
some specific cases.
