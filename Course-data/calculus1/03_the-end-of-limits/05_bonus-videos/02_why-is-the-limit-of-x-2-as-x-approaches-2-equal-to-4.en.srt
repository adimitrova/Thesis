00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,685
[MUSIC] So, what does it mean to say that 
the limit of x^2, as x approaches 2, is 

2
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:16,339
4? Strictly speaking, it means that you 
can make x^2 as close as you want to 4 by 

3
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,456
making x sufficiently close to 2, 
but talking in that way can be a little 

4
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:23,314
bit confusing. 
So I'm going to sort of format it here 

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:27,909
as, as if it were a dialogue. Alright? So 
you're going to make some sort of demand. 

6
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,414
You're going to demand that x^2 be close 
to 4. 

7
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:33,742
Maybe you're going to demand that x^2 be 
within 1/10 of 4. 

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:38,931
Alright? So that means you're, you're 
asking that x^2 be between 3.9, 

9
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:44,046
3.9 is a 1/10 less than 4, 
and 4.1, which is a 1/10 more than 4. 

10
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:49,559
So you're going to make some demand that 
the output be close to 4 and I have to 

11
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,009
satisfy your demand by making x 
sufficiently close to 2. 

12
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:59,401
Now, what does that mean? I'm going to 
satisfy your demand by stipulating that x 

13
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:04,481
be within some small distance of 2. 
So, how close is sufficiently close? 

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:11,431
Well, in this case, let's make let's make 
x be within a 1/100 of 2 and see what 

15
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:17,113
happens. 
So x is within a 1/100 of 2 and that 

16
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:24,087
means that x [SOUND] is bigger than 1.99 
[SOUND] and smaller [SOUND] than 2.01. 

17
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:33,637
And if x is bigger than 1.99, then x^2 is 
bigger than 3.9601, and if x is smaller 

18
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:39,816
than 2.01, then x squared is smaller than 
[SOUND] 4.0401. 

19
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:47,391
And, and look at these numbers, 
3.9601, that is bigger [SOUND] than 3.9, 

20
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:53,502
and over here, 4.0401, that's smaller 
than 4.1. 

21
00:01:53,502 --> 00:02:01,419
So notice what happened here. 
If x is within a 1/100 of 2, then x is 

22
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:08,344
between 1.99 and 2.01. 
But if x is between 1.99 and 2.01, then 

23
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:15,287
x^2 is between 3.9601 and 4.0401, 
and if x^2 is bigger than 3.9601, it's 

24
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:19,752
bigger than 3.9, 
and if x^2 is smaller than 4.0401, it's 

25
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:24,372
smaller than 4.1. 
So that means demanding that x be within 

26
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:29,157
a 1/100 of 2, in fact, forces x^2 to be 
between 3.9 and 4.1. 

27
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:33,562
In other words, it forces x^2 to be 
within a 1/10 of 4. 

28
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:38,856
So if your demand is that x squared be 
within a 1/10 of 4, I can satisfy that 

29
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,973
demand by simply requiring x to be within 
a 1/100 of 2. 

30
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:47,535
Now, I can do the same thing for other 
demands that you might make. 

31
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:53,517
You might have demanded that x^2 be 
within a 1/100 of 4 and I can do that as 

32
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:57,359
well. 
So that would mean that x^2 is between 

33
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,736
3.99 and 4.01. 
Well, if x^2, if you want x^2 to be 

34
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:07,443
between 3.99 and 4.01, I'm going to have 
to make some condition on how close x 

35
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:10,752
have to be to 2. 
So let's try a 1/1000. 

36
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:20,807
So if x is within a 1/1000 of 2, that 
means that X, it'll be between 1.999 and 

37
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:26,240
2.001. 
And if x is bigger than 1.999, then x^2 

38
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:39,328
is bigger [SOUND] than 3.996001. 
And if x < 2.001, then x^2 < 4.004001. 

39
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:49,652
Now, look at these numbers, 3.996001, 
that is bigger 3.99, 

40
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:58,230
and 4.004001, that is smaller than 4.01. 
So if x is within a 1/1000 of 2, that 

41
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:07,053
means x is between 1.999 and 2.001. 
That means that x^2 is between 3.996 and 

42
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:11,742
4.004, a little bit more. 
That makes x^2 be, between 3.99 and 4.01, 

43
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:16,873
which is exactly what you demanded. 
So this is the structure of, of what it 

44
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:22,400
means to say that the limit of x^2 is 4 
as x approaches 2. It means no matter 

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,902
close you demand x ^ 2 to be to 4, even 
if this epsilon were replaced by a very 

46
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:32,257
tiny number. 
I'd be able to find some other distance, 

47
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,955
some number to put here, so that as long 
as x is that close to 2, then x^2 is as 

48
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:41,274
close as you wanted to the number 4. 
So the exercise, below asks you to take a 

49
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:47,832
look at another situation like this to 
see if you can figure out number to put 

50
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:56,972
here to satisfy some condition that 
someone might make on you. 

51
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,175
