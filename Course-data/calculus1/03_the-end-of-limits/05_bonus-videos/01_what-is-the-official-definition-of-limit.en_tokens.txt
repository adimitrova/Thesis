so
now
we
learn
what
the
official
definition
of
limit
is
.
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
=
l
as
x
approaches
a
,
means
the
following
.
it
means
that
for
all
epsilon
bigger
than
zero
,
this
backwards
three
is
the
real
number
epsilon
or
the
greek
letter
,
a
variable
.
so
for
all
epsilon
greater
than
zero
,
there
's
a
delta
greater
than
zero
,
this
is
the
greek
letter
delta
.
so
,
for
all
epsilon
greater
than
zero
,
there
's
a
delta
greater
than
zero
.
so
that
if
,
this
,
if
the
absolute
value
of
x
-
a
is
between
zero
and
delta
,
then
,
the
absolute
value
of
f
(
x
)
-
l
is
less
than
epsilon
.
when
you
say
it
like
that
,
i
think
it
's
really
hard
to
see
how
this
has
any
relationship
to
what
a
more
intuitive
description
of
this
limit
statement
might
be
.
i
mean
,
what
's
this
trying
to
get
at
?
it
's
trying
to
say
f
(
x
)
is
as
close
as
i
want
to
l
by
making
x
sufficiently
close
to
a.
so
,
how
,
how
to
reconcile
those
,
those
two
perspectives
,
right
?
how
does
this
have
anything
to
do
with
things
being
close
.
the
key
,
take
a
look
at
this
absolute
value
of
the
difference
,
right
?
the
absolute
value
of
x
-
a
is
the
distance
between
x
and
a.
so
to
say
that
the
distance
between
x
and
a
is
between
zero
and
delta
is
to
say
that
x
is
within
delta
of
a
,
alright
?
the
distance
from
x
to
a
is
less
than
delta
.
and
to
say
that
the
distance
between
x
and
a
is
bigger
than
zero
is
just
to
say
that
the
distance
between
x
and
,
and
a
,
you
know
,
is
n't
zero
,
right
,
x
is
n't
a.
so
i
can
rewrite
that
,
maybe
in
a
little
bit
easier
way
.
[
sound
]
so
instead
of
saying
that
,
it
's
the
same
thing
to
say
,
if
x
is
not
equal
to
a
,
so
the
absolute
value
of
x
-
a
is
n't
zero
,
and
x
is
within
delta
of
a.
so
the
distance
between
x
and
a
is
delta
.
and
i
can
do
the
same
thing
to
this
absolute
value
of
a
difference
,
alright
?
the
absolute
value
of
f
(
x
)
-
l
,
that
's
the
distance
,
between
f
(
x
)
and
l.
and
the
sum
of
the
distance
between
f
(
x
)
and
l
is
less
than
epsilon
.
well
,
that
just
means
that
f
(
x
)
is
within
epsilon
of
l.
so
,
i
'll
rewrite
that
as
that
.
[
sound
]
here
we
go
.
[
sound
]
then
f
(
x
)
is
within
epsilon
of
l.
so
,
i
think
when
,
when
you
write
it
like
this
,
it
makes
a
little
bit
more
sense
,
right
?
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
=
l
as
x
approaches
a
,
means
that
for
all
numbers
epsilon
,
epsilon
is
measuring
how
close
i
want
f
(
x
)
to
l
,
then
,
there
's
some
corresponding
number
delta
,
which
is
how
close
x
has
to
be
to
a.
so
that
whenever
x
is
that
close
,
delta
,
within
delta
of
a
,
then
f
(
x
)
is
really
within
epsilon
of
l.
and
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
=
l
means
that
no
matter
which
epsilon
i
choose
,
there
's
some
corresponding
delta
,
so
that
whenever
x
is
within
delta
of
a
,
then
f
(
x
)
is
within
epsilon
of
l.
now
,
how
this
actually
gets
played
out
in
,
in
more
concrete
situations
can
be
,
you
know
,
kind
of
complicated
,
but
this
is
really
the
official
definition
of
what
it
means
to
say
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
equals
l
as
x
goes
to
a
.
[
music
]
and
we
're
going
to
be
trying
to
unpack
this
definition
to
see
what
it
might
mean
in
some
specific
cases
.
