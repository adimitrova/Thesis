music so we learn official 
definition limit is 
to say that limit fx l x 
approaches a, means following 
means that epsilon bigger 
zero, this backwards three is real 
number epsilon greek letter, a 
variable so epsilon greater 
zero, theres a delta greater zero, 
this is greek letter delta 
so, epsilon greater zero, 
theres a delta greater zero 
so that if, this, if absolute value 
x a is between zero delta, then, 
absolute value fx l is less 
epsilon 
you say like that, i think 
really hard to see this 
relationship to a intuitive 
description this limit statement might 

i mean, whats this trying to get 
trying to say fx is close i 
want to l making x sufficiently close 
to a 
so, how, to reconcile those, 
two perspectives, right this 
anything to things 
close 
key, take a look this absolute 
value difference, 
right 
absolute value x a is 
distance between x a 
so to say that distance between x 
a is between zero delta is to say 
that x is within delta a, alright 
distance x to a is less delta 
to say that distance between x 
a is bigger zero is to say 
that distance between x and, a, 
you know, isnt zero, right, x isnt a 
so i rewrite that, maybe in a little 
bit easier way 
sound so instead saying that, 
thing to say, if x is equal 
to a, so absolute value x a 
isnt zero, x is within delta a 
so distance between x a is delta 
i thing to this 
absolute value a difference, alright 
absolute value fx l, thats 
distance, between fx l 
sum distance between fx 
l is less epsilon 
well, that means that fx is within 
epsilon l 
so, ill rewrite that that sound 
here we go 
sound fx is within epsilon l 
so, i think when, you write like 
this, makes a little bit sense, 
right 
to say that limit fx l x 
approaches a, 
means that numbers epsilon, 
epsilon is measuring close i want 
fx to l, 
then, theres corresponding number 
delta, is close x to to 
a 
so that whenever x is that close, delta, 
within delta a, 
fx is really within epsilon l 
to say that limit fx l 
means that matter epsilon i 
choose, theres corresponding delta, 
so that whenever x is within delta a, 
fx is within epsilon l 
now, this actually gets played 
in, in concrete situations be, 
you know, kind complicated, this 
is really official definition 
means to say that limit fx 
equals l x goes to a music 
going to trying to unpack this 
definition to see might mean in 
specific cases
