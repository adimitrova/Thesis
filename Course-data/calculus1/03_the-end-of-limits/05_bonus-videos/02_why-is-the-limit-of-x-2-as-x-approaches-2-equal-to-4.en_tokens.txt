so
,
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
the
limit
of
x^2
,
as
x
approaches
2
,
is
4
?
strictly
speaking
,
it
means
that
you
can
make
x^2
as
close
as
you
want
to
4
by
making
x
sufficiently
close
to
2
,
but
talking
in
that
way
can
be
a
little
bit
confusing
.
so
i
'm
going
to
sort
of
format
it
here
as
,
as
if
it
were
a
dialogue
.
alright
?
so
you
're
going
to
make
some
sort
of
demand
.
you
're
going
to
demand
that
x^2
be
close
to
4.
maybe
you
're
going
to
demand
that
x^2
be
within
1/10
of
4.
alright
?
so
that
means
you
're
,
you
're
asking
that
x^2
be
between
3.9
,
3.9
is
a
1/10
less
than
4
,
and
4.1
,
which
is
a
1/10
more
than
4.
so
you
're
going
to
make
some
demand
that
the
output
be
close
to
4
and
i
have
to
satisfy
your
demand
by
making
x
sufficiently
close
to
2.
now
,
what
does
that
mean
?
i
'm
going
to
satisfy
your
demand
by
stipulating
that
x
be
within
some
small
distance
of
2.
so
,
how
close
is
sufficiently
close
?
well
,
in
this
case
,
let
's
make
let
's
make
x
be
within
a
1/100
of
2
and
see
what
happens
.
so
x
is
within
a
1/100
of
2
and
that
means
that
x
[
sound
]
is
bigger
than
1.99
[
sound
]
and
smaller
[
sound
]
than
2.01.
and
if
x
is
bigger
than
1.99
,
then
x^2
is
bigger
than
3.9601
,
and
if
x
is
smaller
than
2.01
,
then
x
squared
is
smaller
than
[
sound
]
4.0401.
and
,
and
look
at
these
numbers
,
3.9601
,
that
is
bigger
[
sound
]
than
3.9
,
and
over
here
,
4.0401
,
that
's
smaller
than
4.1.
so
notice
what
happened
here
.
if
x
is
within
a
1/100
of
2
,
then
x
is
between
1.99
and
2.01.
but
if
x
is
between
1.99
and
2.01
,
then
x^2
is
between
3.9601
and
4.0401
,
and
if
x^2
is
bigger
than
3.9601
,
it
's
bigger
than
3.9
,
and
if
x^2
is
smaller
than
4.0401
,
it
's
smaller
than
4.1.
so
that
means
demanding
that
x
be
within
a
1/100
of
2
,
in
fact
,
forces
x^2
to
be
between
3.9
and
4.1.
in
other
words
,
it
forces
x^2
to
be
within
a
1/10
of
4.
so
if
your
demand
is
that
x
squared
be
within
a
1/10
of
4
,
i
can
satisfy
that
demand
by
simply
requiring
x
to
be
within
a
1/100
of
2.
now
,
i
can
do
the
same
thing
for
other
demands
that
you
might
make
.
you
might
have
demanded
that
x^2
be
within
a
1/100
of
4
and
i
can
do
that
as
well
.
so
that
would
mean
that
x^2
is
between
3.99
and
4.01.
well
,
if
x^2
,
if
you
want
x^2
to
be
between
3.99
and
4.01
,
i
'm
going
to
have
to
make
some
condition
on
how
close
x
have
to
be
to
2.
so
let
's
try
a
1/1000
.
so
if
x
is
within
a
1/1000
of
2
,
that
means
that
x
,
it
'll
be
between
1.999
and
and
if
x
is
bigger
than
1.999
,
then
x^2
is
bigger
[
sound
]
than
3.996001.
and
if
x
<
2.001
,
then
x^2
<
4.004001.
now
,
look
at
these
numbers
,
3.996001
,
that
is
bigger
3.99
,
and
4.004001
,
that
is
smaller
than
4.01.
so
if
x
is
within
a
1/1000
of
2
,
that
means
x
is
between
1.999
and
2.001.
that
means
that
x^2
is
between
3.996
and
4.004
,
a
little
bit
more
.
that
makes
x^2
be
,
between
3.99
and
4.01
,
which
is
exactly
what
you
demanded
.
so
this
is
the
structure
of
,
of
what
it
means
to
say
that
the
limit
of
x^2
is
4
as
x
approaches
2.
it
means
no
matter
close
you
demand
x
^
2
to
be
to
4
,
even
if
this
epsilon
were
replaced
by
a
very
tiny
number
.
i
'd
be
able
to
find
some
other
distance
,
some
number
to
put
here
,
so
that
as
long
as
x
is
that
close
to
2
,
then
x^2
is
as
close
as
you
wanted
to
the
number
4.
so
the
exercise
,
below
asks
you
to
take
a
look
at
another
situation
like
this
to
see
if
you
can
figure
out
number
to
put
here
to
satisfy
some
condition
that
someone
might
make
on
you
.
