we
've
already
have
been
thinking
about
functions
and
about
limits
.
and
now
i
want
to
think
deeper
into
those
two
ideas
.
in
terms
of
functions
,
i
want
to
think
,
what
does
it
even
mean
for
a
function
to
be
continues
.
how
does
that
relate
to
limits
.
and
what
are
some
consequences
of
a
function
's
being
continuous
?
and
in
terms
of
limits
,
what
would
i
think
about
different
kinds
of
limits
now
?
i
want
to
think
about
one
side
of
limits
.
i
want
to
know
what
can
i
say
about
a
function
's
output
if
i
'm
looking
at
input
points
that
are
just
a
little
bit
below
some
point
.
or
if
i
'm
just
looking
at
input
points
that
are
a
little
bit
above
some
point
.
it
'd
be
a
one
sided
limit
.
i
want
to
know
what
happens
when
i
evaluate
a
function
at
very
large
input
points
.
that
'd
be
a
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
i
want
to
be
able
to
say
,
maybe
,
that
my
function
's
output
value
is
as
large
as
i
'd
like
as
long
as
my
input
point
is
close
enough
to
some
chosen
point
.
that
'll
be
saying
that
the
limit
equals
infinity
.
so
,
these
are
some
of
the
ideas
i
want
to
look
at
.
i
want
to
look
at
limits
that
are
approaching
from
one
side
.
i
want
to
look
at
limits
involving
infinity
in
various
ways
.
i
think
there
's
a
lot
of
really
interesting
questions
to
ask
along
these
lines
,
so
let
's
get
started
.
