00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:10,350
We've already have been thinking about
functions and about limits.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,310
And now I want to think deeper into those
two ideas.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,360
In terms of functions, I want to think,
what does

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,700
it even mean for a function to be
continues.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,940
How does that relate to limits.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,110
And what are some consequences of a
function's being continuous?

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,890
And in terms of limits, what would I think
about different kinds of limits now?

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,940
I want to think about one side of limits.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,120
I want to know what can I say about a
function's output if

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm looking at input points that are just
a little bit below some point.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,340
Or if I'm just looking at input points
that are a little bit above some point.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,740
It'd be a one sided limit.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,870
I want to know what happens when I

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,080
evaluate a function at very large input
points.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,090
That'd be a limit as x approaches
infinity.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,150
I want to be able to say, maybe, that my
function's output value is as large

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,395
as I'd like as long as my input point is
close enough to some chosen point.

18
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:07,080
That'll be saying that the limit equals
infinity.

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,850
So, these are some of the ideas I want to
look at.

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,440
I want to look at limits that are
approaching from one side.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,200
I want to look at limits involving
infinity in various ways.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,705
I think there's a lot of really
interesting questions

23
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,915
to ask along these lines, so let's get
started.
