weve already thinking 
functions limits 
i want to think deeper 
two ideas 
in terms functions, i want to think, 

even mean a function to 
continues 
that relate to limits 
consequences a 
functions continuous 
in terms limits, would i think 
different kinds limits 
i want to think one side limits 
i want to know i say a 
functions output if 
im looking input points that 
a little bit point 
if im looking input points 
that a little bit point 
itd a one sided limit 
i want to know happens i 
evaluate a function large input 
points 
thatd a limit x approaches 
infinity 
i want to able to say, maybe, that 
functions output value is large 
id like long input point is 
close enough to chosen point 
thatll saying that limit equals 
infinity 
so, ideas i want to 
look 
i want to look limits that 
approaching one side 
i want to look limits involving 
infinity in various ways 
i think theres a lot really 
interesting questions 
to ask along lines, so lets get 
started
