00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,881
[music] You've already seen some examples
where we're antidifferentiating the powers

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,619
of x.
So here's an example.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,733
What would I have to differentiate, right?
What goes in this cloud?

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:19,822
So if I differentiate it I get 3 x squared
or stated differently, what's the

5
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:24,132
antiderivative of 3 x squared.
I've just got to think of some function

6
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:26,710
because if I differentiate it I get 3 x
squared.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,714
Well I can think of one.
X cubed is an example of a function that

8
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:35,661
if I differentiate x cubed I get back 3 x
squared.

9
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,353
What about the general case?
So when I think about what would I

10
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,850
differentiate to get x to the n.
Here I'm going to suppose that x is some

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,763
number but it's not negative 1.
Right, so in other words I want to know

12
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:50,746
what the anti derivative of x to the n is.
Right, so I'm thinking what would I

13
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:55,345
differentiate to get x to the n?
And, I'm going to claim that it's x to the

14
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:59,289
n plus 1, divided by n plus 1.
Now how do I know that this is the

15
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,675
anti-derivative of x to the n?
Well all I've got to do is differentiate.

16
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:08,263
Alright, I'll differentiate x to the n
plus 1 over n plus 1.

17
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:11,619
And I'll do that with the power rule and
the constant multiple rule.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,838
This constant multiple just comes on out
of this differentiation.

19
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:20,130
So I've got 1 over n plus 1 times the
derivative of x to the n plus 1.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,122
Now, what does the power rule tell me?
Power rule tells me how to differentiate

21
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,135
this.
Right?

22
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:32,185
That's n plus 1, times x to the n plus 1
minus 1 which is just x to the n.

23
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:37,971
But now this n plus 1 and n plus 1 cancels
what I'm left with is just x to the n and

24
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:43,667
that's exactly what I'm claiming right
that the n type derivative of x to the n

25
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:48,745
is x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1.
I should be careful to point out something

26
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:52,053
here.
What if I wanted to anti differentiate a

27
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,488
polynomial.
For example let's suppose I want to find a

28
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,113
function big f so that the derivative of
big f is little f.

29
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:06,394
And maybe little f is a polynomial like
maybe little f is 15 x squared I don't

30
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:10,625
know minus 4 x plus 3.
All right so I'm really asking for an

31
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:15,104
antiderivative of little f.
I'm asking for a function whose derivative

32
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,847
is this polynomial.
We can totally do this.

33
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:22,541
So let's do this using the notation that
we've been developing.

34
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:31,840
So I'm going to write antiderivative of 15
x squared minus 4 x plus 3 dx.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,580
And this is the antiderivative of a sum of
the difference, and that's the sum of the

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,084
difference of the antiderivative.
So I can write this as the antiderivative

37
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:46,745
of 15 x squared dx minus the
anti-derivative of 4 x, dx plus the

38
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:51,550
antiderivative of 3 dx.
Now I've got the antiderivative of a

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,168
number times something.
So I can pull these numbers outside of the

40
00:02:56,168 --> 00:03:00,440
antiderivatives.
So I rewrite this as 15 times the

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,056
antiderivative of x squared dx minus four
times the antiderivative of x dx, plus,

42
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:12,361
alright, the antiderivative of 3 dx.
Okay.

43
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:15,630
Then I think what's the antiderivative of,
of x squared.

44
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,032
What's just an antiderivative of x
squared?

45
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,832
Well, I know one.
It's x to the 3rd over 3, right?

46
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:27,562
That's the power rule running in reverse.
Minus 4 times, this is an antiderivative

47
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:30,791
of x, something that I differentiate to
get x.

48
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:35,522
Well, that's x squared over 2, right?
If I differentiate x squared over 2, I get

49
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:37,415
back x.
And what's an antiderivative of 3?

50
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:41,955
What's something I differentiate to get 3?
Well, 3x is such a thing, and to write

51
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:46,344
down the most general antiderivative, I'm
going to add plus C here.

52
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:50,290
So this is the antiderivative of this
polynomial.

53
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,224
And I could write this a little bit more
nicely now since some of these things

54
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:59,220
cancel.
15 3rds is 5 x to the 3rd, minus 2 x

55
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,391
squared, plus 3 x, plus c.
Here we're using a sum rule, a power rule

56
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:09,190
and also a constant multiple rule that we
haven't seen yet.

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,906
So it's worth writing down that constant
multiple rule explicitly.

58
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:16,666
Just remember what the constant multiple
rule says for just differentiation.

59
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:21,490
Yeah.
If I differentiate say some number a times

60
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:29,594
some function big f of x, well that's just
a times the derivative of big f of x.

61
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:34,432
And I can write down the same kind of
rule, but for antiderivatives.

62
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:40,105
For antiderivatives, if I'm
antidifferentiating, say, a times little f

63
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:45,111
of x.
Well, this is the same as a times the

64
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:50,960
antiderivative of f of x.
Its not too difficult to justify this.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,745
So yeah lets try to justify this constant
multiple rule for antiderivatives.

66
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:02,920
Lets suppose that f differentiates to give
me f of x.

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,013
So I'm really is supposing that big f is
an antiderivative for little f.

68
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:14,254
Then this side here, I could rewrite a
times the antiderivative of f as a times

69
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:18,743
big f, it's an antiderivative of f, right,
plus C.

70
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:24,394
So that if I'm claiming that this, the
antiderivative of a times f of x is this.

71
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:29,760
It's enough to just check that the
derivative of this is really this.

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,997
And that's true, right?
What's the derivative of a times F of x

73
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:37,958
was exactly what I did up here, you know?
These rules for antidifferentiation are

74
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,927
exactly coming from the rules of
differentiation.

75
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:45,908
So the derivative of this constant
multiple times F of x is that constant

76
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:50,888
multiple times the derivative of F of x,
right, and I'm claiming that the

77
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:56,197
derivative of F of x is little f.
So this is a times little f of x.

78
00:05:56,198 --> 00:06:00,720
Which is exactly saying that the
antiderivative here, is this.

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:09,803
Which is what I'm trying to justify.
