now
,
we
've
seen
how
to
antidifferentiate
some
trig
functions
and
polynomials
.
can
we
antidifferentiate
,
say
,
e
to
the
x
?
so
,
the
most
general
antiderivative
of
e
to
the
x
,
is
just
e
to
the
x
plus
some
constant
c.
how
do
i
know
that
?
the
derivative
of
e
to
the
x
is
itself
and
consequently
the
antiderivative
of
e
to
the
x
must
also
be
itself
and
it
's
just
plus
some
single
constant
c.
since
this
is
a
function
as
to
find
in
a
whole
real
line
,
well
,
great
,
we
've
found
an
antiderivative
for
e
to
the
x.
what
about
an
antiderivative
for
log
?
so
,
in
symbols
,
right
,
what
i
'm
looking
for
is
an
antiderivative
of
the
natural
log
of
x
,
right
,
some
function
that
differentiates
the
natural
log
of
x.
but
have
we
ever
differentiated
anything
and
got
log
as
the
answer
?
who
knows
?
but
it
turns
out
that
the
derivative
of
x
log
x
is
not
so
far
off
,
right
?
this
is
a
derivative
product
,
so
by
the
product
rule
,
it
's
the
first
thing
times
the
derivative
of
the
second
plus
the
derivative
of
the
first
thing
times
the
second
thing
,
right
?
so
,
the
derivative
of
x
times
log
x
is
1
plus
log
x
,
so
not
too
far
off
.
now
,
you
can
kind
of
tweak
this
a
little
bit
,
right
?
what
's
the
derivative
of
x
log
x
minus
x
?
well
,
that
's
the
derivative
of
x
log
x
minus
the
derivative
of
x
which
is
1.
but
i
've
just
calculated
the
derivative
of
x
log
x.
it
's
1
plus
log
x
and
then
minus
1
,
what
i
'm
left
with
then
is
just
log
x
,
right
?
so
,
the
derivative
of
x
log
x
minus
x
is
just
log
x.
so
,
in
light
of
that
,
we
can
summarize
the
situation
as
follows
.
so
,
yes
,
i
mean
,
in
,
in
light
of
this
,
i
can
say
that
the
antiderivative
of
the
natural
log
is
x
times
natural
log
of
x
minus
x
plus
some
constant
c.
all
of
this
is
just
so
awful
.
it
's
just
so
depressing
.
you
know
,
the
answers
are
coming
,
but
they
're
coming
out
of
the
void
.
i
mean
,
they
're
just
answers
without
any
meaning
or
structure
.
we
're
finding
these
antiderivatives
just
by
really
clever
guessing
,
you
know
,
and
it
does
n't
seem
obvious
how
anyone
would
ever
cook
up
these
answers
.
i
mean
,
if
,
if
you
're
not
feeling
really
depressed
right
now
,
you
probably
should
be
.
you
know
,
this
is
really
bad
.
