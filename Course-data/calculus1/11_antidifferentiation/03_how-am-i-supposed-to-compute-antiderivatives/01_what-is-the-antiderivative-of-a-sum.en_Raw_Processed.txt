music a long, long time ago we started 
writing rules differentiating 
we rules antidifferentiating 
well 
suppose big f is an antiderivative 
little f, big g is an antiderivative 
little g 
i mean that if i to 
differentiate big f id get little f 
if i to differentiate big g id 
get little g 
now, i find an antiderivative 
function f plus g 
specifically lets define a new function 
ill call little h little h x will 
little f x plus little g x, 
right 
so function little h is sum 
f g 
claim, is that this function 
that ill call big h, is sum 
big f big g 
claim is that this big h is an 
antiderivative little h 
i mean that if i differentiate 
big h i get little h thats true, 
right 
if i differentiate big f, i get 
little f if i differentiate big g, i 
get little g 
derivative a sum is sum 
derivatives so antiderivative a 
sum is sum antiderivatives 
better to say that an 
antiderivative sum, is sum 
antiderivatives 
yeah 
i want to write this a general 
principle 
i really write that 
general principle, im going to introduce 
a little bit notation 
so suppose big f is an antiderivative 
little f, that means 
antiderivative little f written 
like this, big f x plus c 
now, notation writing 
antiderivative little f is this, is 
exactly this notation here, this long 
curvy 
so ill write this, antiderivative 
f respect to x is big f x plus c 
this notation in hand this long 
denoting, antiderivative 
we actually start to write 
rules antiderivatives, i in 
particular, i write general 
principle anti differentiating a sum 
suppose that antiderivative 
little f is big f x plus c 
antiderivative little g is big g plus 
c 
whats an antiderivative little f 
plus little g 
well, we already saw this right 
if i add together big f big g thats 
an antiderivative little f plus little 
g 
so i could write that general 
antiderivative f plus g, is big f, plus 
big g, plus c 
or, i could write this same, concept 
this way, that antiderivative f 
plus g, is antiderivative f plus 
antiderivative g 
this is really nice, right 
kinds formulas that 
weve seen derivatives right 
derivative sum is sum 
derivatives 
a result, antiderivative a 
sum 
is sum antiderivatives 
so antiderivative a sum is sum 
antiderivatives this is 
first many antidifferentiation rules 
that well learning
