music i antidifferentiate trig 
functions 
sine cosine easy if we 
remember derivatives 
derivative sine x, respect 
to x, is cosine x 
derivative negative cosine is 
sine 
so antiderivatives 
knowing this, i know 
antiderivatives 
if derivative sine is cosine, 
antiderivative cosine is sine plus 
c 
if derivative negative cosine 
is sine 
that means antiderivative sine is 
negative cosine plus c 
well tangent 
would i differentiate to get tangent 
x 
yeah, im asking i differentiate 
to get tangent whats 
antiderivative tangent 
im claiming, that antiderivative 
tangent is log secant x, plus 
constant 
i know this 
well, to verify this is true, enough 
to a differentiation problem 
i need to check that derivative log 
secant x is equal to tan x 
i know this 
well i to differentiate this 
composition functions 
composition log secant, 
ill in chain rule, right 
so whats derivative log 
one 
so inside function times 
derivative secant 
whats derivative secant 
secant tangent 
alright, so this is secant times 
secant x times tangent x 
good news secants cancel 
im left is tangent x 
so ive found an antiderivative 
tangent 
totally opaque to somebody 
would ever gotten that 
antiderivative tangent 
yet, that candidate 
antiderivative revealed to us, we 
verify that truly an antiderivative 
differentiating checking 
that really gives us tangent 
ok, lets try another one kinds 
problems 
whats an antiderivative secant 
so im asking a function, whose 
derivative is secant x 
right 
im looking antiderivative 
secant x 
is that 
well turns that antiderivative 
secant x is this 
log, absolute value secant x 
plus tangent x 
again, totally mysterious, right, 
this came 
we verify that thats truly an 
antiderivative 
so to verify that antiderivative 
secant x is this, enough to 
differentiate this end secant 
x 
so lets try that, alright 
ill differentiate log absolute 
value secant x plus tangent x 
i get 
well, derivative log is 
inside function, is secant x plus 
tangent x 
times derivative inside 
function 
this is really chain rule in action 
right 
now, whats derivative this sum 
well, thats sum derivatives, 
right 
so derivative secant is secant x 
tangent x 
derivative of, tangent 
is secant squared, this is divided 
secant x plus tangent x 
note i factor a secant x here, 
ive got secant x times numerator 
is tangent x plus secant x 
denominators thing 
i mean i wrote in opposite order 
this is great, right 
this cancels im left is 
secant x 
so yeah, derivative this is secant 
x consequently antiderivative 
secant x is this 
this is really a key in to anti 
multiplying, to factoring 
if you remember experience, 
multiplying antimultiplying, 
factoring numbers, right 
factoring hard 
i to a bunch trial division to 
figure to factor a number 
i that factorization, 
purported factorization, in hand, 
checking easy 
multiplying is something that you 
story here derivatives, 
right 
anti differentiating is hard, i mean 
seems hard to figure anti 
differentiating derivative is 
you show a guess, i verify 
that guess is correct 
easy step differentiating 
seeing if youre right 
i hope that examples giving you 
real respect true 
difficulties antidifferentiation 
differentiating is a mechanical process 
you to apply rules 
carefully 
weve seen that 
antidifferentiation requires flashes 
insight, cooking correct 
answer verifying that 
correct 
well this seems, you know, impossible to 
continue, right 
we ever find antiderivatives if 
we to keep hoping insight to 
appear 
well good news is that 
rest this course will developing 
tools to make this kind guessing 
systematic right 
instead relying sheer insight 
to solve problems 
going to providing tools that 
will aid insight aid 
creativity, provide a little bit 
structure so that you exploit 
patterns that going to seeing, 
order finite derivatives much 
easily 
so i think seems hard right now, 
going to get a lot easier
