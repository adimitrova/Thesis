music i must unveil a secret 
is rarely revealed people first 
learning antiderivatives 
consider example function f x 
equals x 
is general antiderivative 
this function, right 
whats general thing that 
differentiates to x 
well, i know anti derivative log 
absolute value x 
thats right 
derivative log absolute 
value x is equal to x 
so, an anti derivative x is log 
absolute value x 
in fact i know anti derivatives 
well 
example, derivative log 
absolute value x plus is also equal 
to x, right, derivative 
is 
generally derivative log 
absolute value x plus fixed 
constant is equal to x 
so this is a general antiderivative 
x 
there many, many anti 
derivatives came 
example, heres another one that 
doesnt fit pattern that weve 
seen thus far 
final function big f 
ill define using this, piece wise 
notation, right 
so if x is positive function big f 
will defined to log x plus , 
if x is negative, function will 
defined to log negative x plus 
in fact, derivative this 
function is x, so this is an 
antiderivative x 
upshot here is that constant could 
different to left to right 
zero 
so general anti derivative 
x is a function this form, right 
big f, log x plus c if x is positive 
log negative x plus d if x is 
negative, constants c d 
we see this in a graph 
well here ive got a graph y equals log 
x 
here ive got a graph log negative 
x 
point, is that i move 
two graphs down, independently, 
without affecting derivative 
matter i move graphs 
derivative is always x 
i mean, if i move this thing 
down, doesnt affect slopes 
tangent lines 
if i move this piece down, 
doesnt affect slopes tangent 
lines 
i move 
independently 
i dont really to line 
all, right 
i mean, since functions defined 
zero, i dont to worry 
making agree anywhere 
i slide fully 
independently nevertheless 
derivative is always x 
one way to summarize this is follows 
so suppose that f is a function an 
antiderivative big f 
antiderivative little f 
form big f x plus c x 
right 
cs a single constant anymore 
c is locally constant function 
point is that this so called constant 
could different different pieces 
domain 
like in this example x 
constant change right 
left hand side zero 
heres sad, sad truth 
in spite this, textbooks 
nevertheless write that general 
antiderivative x is log 
absolute value x plus constant c 
provides a sneaky way 
this is perfectly fine, right 
so this is fine provided 
provided that c isnt a constant c is 
a locally constant function x
