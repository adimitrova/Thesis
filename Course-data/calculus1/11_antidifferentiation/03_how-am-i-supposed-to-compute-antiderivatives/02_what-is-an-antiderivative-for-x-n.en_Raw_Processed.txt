music youve already seen examples 
antidifferentiating powers 
x 
so heres an example 
would i to differentiate, right 
goes in this cloud 
so if i differentiate i get x squared 
stated differently, whats 
antiderivative x squared 
ive got to think function 
if i differentiate i get x 
squared 
well i think one 
x cubed is an example a function that 
if i differentiate x cubed i get back x 
squared 
general case 
so i think would i 
differentiate to get x to n 
here im going to suppose that x is 
number negative 
right, so in words i want to know 
anti derivative x to n is 
right, so im thinking would i 
differentiate to get x to n 
and, im going to claim that x to 
n plus , divided n plus 
i know that this is 
antiderivative x to n 
well ive got to is differentiate 
alright, ill differentiate x to n 
plus n plus 
ill that power rule 
constant multiple rule 
this constant multiple comes 
this differentiation 
so ive got n plus times 
derivative x to n plus 
now, power rule tell 
power rule tells to differentiate 
this 
right 
thats n plus , times x to n plus 
minus is x to n 
this n plus n plus cancels 
im left is x to n 
thats exactly im claiming right 
that n type derivative x to n 
is x to n plus n plus 
i careful to point something 
here 
if i wanted to anti differentiate a 
polynomial 
example lets suppose i want to find a 
function big f so that derivative 
big f is little f 
maybe little f is a polynomial like 
maybe little f is x squared i dont 
know minus x plus 
right so im really asking an 
antiderivative little f 
im asking a function whose derivative 
is this polynomial 
we totally this 
so lets this using notation that 
weve developing 
so im going to write antiderivative 
x squared minus x plus dx 
this is antiderivative a sum 
difference, thats sum 
difference antiderivative 
so i write this antiderivative 
x squared dx minus 
antiderivative x, dx plus 
antiderivative dx 
ive got antiderivative a 
number times something 
so i pull numbers outside 
antiderivatives 
so i rewrite this times 
antiderivative x squared dx minus four 
times antiderivative x dx, plus, 
alright, antiderivative dx 
okay 
i think whats antiderivative of, 
x squared 
whats an antiderivative x 
squared 
well, i know one 
x to rd , right 
thats power rule running in reverse 
minus times, this is an antiderivative 
x, something that i differentiate to 
get x 
well, thats x squared , right 
if i differentiate x squared , i get 
back x 
whats an antiderivative 
whats something i differentiate to get 
well, x is a thing, to write 
general antiderivative, im 
going to add plus c here 
so this is antiderivative this 
polynomial 
i could write this a little bit 
nicely since things 
cancel 
rds is x to rd, minus x 
squared, plus x, plus c 
here using a sum rule, a power rule 
also a constant multiple rule that we 
havent seen yet 
so worth writing that constant 
multiple rule explicitly 
remember constant multiple 
rule says differentiation 
yeah 
if i differentiate say number a times 
function big f x, well thats 
a times derivative big f x 
i write kind 
rule, antiderivatives 
antiderivatives, if im 
antidifferentiating, say, a times little f 
x 
well, this is a times 
antiderivative f x 
difficult to justify this 
so yeah lets try to justify this constant 
multiple rule antiderivatives 
lets suppose that f differentiates to give 
f x 
so im really is supposing that big f is 
an antiderivative little f 
this side here, i could rewrite a 
times antiderivative f a times 
big f, an antiderivative f, right, 
plus c 
so that if im claiming that this, 
antiderivative a times f x is this 
enough to check that 
derivative this is really this 
thats true, right 
whats derivative a times f x 
exactly i here, you know 
rules antidifferentiation 
exactly coming rules 
differentiation 
so derivative this constant 
multiple times f x is that constant 
multiple times derivative f x, 
right, im claiming that 
derivative f x is little f 
so this is a times little f x 
is exactly saying that 
antiderivative here, is this 
is im trying to justify
