you
've
already
seen
some
examples
where
we
're
antidifferentiating
the
powers
of
x.
so
here
's
an
example
.
what
would
i
have
to
differentiate
,
right
?
what
goes
in
this
cloud
?
so
if
i
differentiate
it
i
get
3
x
squared
or
stated
differently
,
what
's
the
antiderivative
of
3
x
squared
.
i
've
just
got
to
think
of
some
function
because
if
i
differentiate
it
i
get
3
x
squared
.
well
i
can
think
of
one
.
x
cubed
is
an
example
of
a
function
that
if
i
differentiate
x
cubed
i
get
back
3
x
squared
.
what
about
the
general
case
?
so
when
i
think
about
what
would
i
differentiate
to
get
x
to
the
n.
here
i
'm
going
to
suppose
that
x
is
some
number
but
it
's
not
negative
1.
right
,
so
in
other
words
i
want
to
know
what
the
anti
derivative
of
x
to
the
n
is
.
right
,
so
i
'm
thinking
what
would
i
differentiate
to
get
x
to
the
n
?
and
,
i
'm
going
to
claim
that
it
's
x
to
the
n
plus
1
,
divided
by
n
plus
1.
now
how
do
i
know
that
this
is
the
anti-derivative
of
x
to
the
n
?
well
all
i
've
got
to
do
is
differentiate
.
alright
,
i
'll
differentiate
x
to
the
n
plus
1
over
n
plus
1.
and
i
'll
do
that
with
the
power
rule
and
the
constant
multiple
rule
.
this
constant
multiple
just
comes
on
out
of
this
differentiation
.
so
i
've
got
1
over
n
plus
1
times
the
derivative
of
x
to
the
n
plus
1.
now
,
what
does
the
power
rule
tell
me
?
power
rule
tells
me
how
to
differentiate
this
.
right
?
that
's
n
plus
1
,
times
x
to
the
n
plus
1
minus
1
which
is
just
x
to
the
n.
but
now
this
n
plus
1
and
n
plus
1
cancels
what
i
'm
left
with
is
just
x
to
the
n
and
that
's
exactly
what
i
'm
claiming
right
that
the
n
type
derivative
of
x
to
the
n
is
x
to
the
n
plus
1
over
n
plus
1.
i
should
be
careful
to
point
out
something
here
.
what
if
i
wanted
to
anti
differentiate
a
polynomial
.
for
example
let
's
suppose
i
want
to
find
a
function
big
f
so
that
the
derivative
of
big
f
is
little
f.
and
maybe
little
f
is
a
polynomial
like
maybe
little
f
is
15
x
squared
i
do
n't
know
minus
4
x
plus
3.
all
right
so
i
'm
really
asking
for
an
antiderivative
of
little
f.
i
'm
asking
for
a
function
whose
derivative
is
this
polynomial
.
we
can
totally
do
this
.
so
let
's
do
this
using
the
notation
that
we
've
been
developing
.
so
i
'm
going
to
write
antiderivative
of
15
x
squared
minus
4
x
plus
3
dx
.
and
this
is
the
antiderivative
of
a
sum
of
the
difference
,
and
that
's
the
sum
of
the
difference
of
the
antiderivative
.
so
i
can
write
this
as
the
antiderivative
of
15
x
squared
dx
minus
the
anti-derivative
of
4
x
,
dx
plus
the
antiderivative
of
3
dx
.
now
i
've
got
the
antiderivative
of
a
number
times
something
.
so
i
can
pull
these
numbers
outside
of
the
antiderivatives
.
so
i
rewrite
this
as
15
times
the
antiderivative
of
x
squared
dx
minus
four
times
the
antiderivative
of
x
dx
,
plus
,
alright
,
the
antiderivative
of
3
dx
.
okay
.
then
i
think
what
's
the
antiderivative
of
,
of
x
squared
.
what
's
just
an
antiderivative
of
x
squared
?
well
,
i
know
one
.
it
's
x
to
the
3rd
over
3
,
right
?
that
's
the
power
rule
running
in
reverse
.
minus
4
times
,
this
is
an
antiderivative
of
x
,
something
that
i
differentiate
to
get
x.
well
,
that
's
x
squared
over
2
,
right
?
if
i
differentiate
x
squared
over
2
,
i
get
back
x.
and
what
's
an
antiderivative
of
3
?
what
's
something
i
differentiate
to
get
3
?
well
,
3x
is
such
a
thing
,
and
to
write
down
the
most
general
antiderivative
,
i
'm
going
to
add
plus
c
here
.
so
this
is
the
antiderivative
of
this
polynomial
.
and
i
could
write
this
a
little
bit
more
nicely
now
since
some
of
these
things
cancel
.
15
3rds
is
5
x
to
the
3rd
,
minus
2
x
squared
,
plus
3
x
,
plus
c.
here
we
're
using
a
sum
rule
,
a
power
rule
and
also
a
constant
multiple
rule
that
we
have
n't
seen
yet
.
so
it
's
worth
writing
down
that
constant
multiple
rule
explicitly
.
just
remember
what
the
constant
multiple
rule
says
for
just
differentiation
.
yeah
.
if
i
differentiate
say
some
number
a
times
some
function
big
f
of
x
,
well
that
's
just
a
times
the
derivative
of
big
f
of
x.
and
i
can
write
down
the
same
kind
of
rule
,
but
for
antiderivatives
.
for
antiderivatives
,
if
i
'm
antidifferentiating
,
say
,
a
times
little
f
of
x.
well
,
this
is
the
same
as
a
times
the
antiderivative
of
f
of
x.
its
not
too
difficult
to
justify
this
.
so
yeah
lets
try
to
justify
this
constant
multiple
rule
for
antiderivatives
.
lets
suppose
that
f
differentiates
to
give
me
f
of
x.
so
i
'm
really
is
supposing
that
big
f
is
an
antiderivative
for
little
f.
then
this
side
here
,
i
could
rewrite
a
times
the
antiderivative
of
f
as
a
times
big
f
,
it
's
an
antiderivative
of
f
,
right
,
plus
c.
so
that
if
i
'm
claiming
that
this
,
the
antiderivative
of
a
times
f
of
x
is
this
.
it
's
enough
to
just
check
that
the
derivative
of
this
is
really
this
.
and
that
's
true
,
right
?
what
's
the
derivative
of
a
times
f
of
x
was
exactly
what
i
did
up
here
,
you
know
?
these
rules
for
antidifferentiation
are
exactly
coming
from
the
rules
of
differentiation
.
so
the
derivative
of
this
constant
multiple
times
f
of
x
is
that
constant
multiple
times
the
derivative
of
f
of
x
,
right
,
and
i
'm
claiming
that
the
derivative
of
f
of
x
is
little
f.
so
this
is
a
times
little
f
of
x.
which
is
exactly
saying
that
the
antiderivative
here
,
is
this
.
which
is
what
i
'm
trying
to
justify
.
