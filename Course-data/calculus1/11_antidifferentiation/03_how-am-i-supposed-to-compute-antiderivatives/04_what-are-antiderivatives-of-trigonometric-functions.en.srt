00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,054
[music] How do I antidifferentiate trig
functions?

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:10,700
Sine and cosine are easy if we just
remember their derivatives.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,800
The derivative of sine of x, with respect
to x, is cosine x.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,980
And the derivative of negative cosine is
sine.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,782
So what are their anti-derivatives?
Knowing this, now I know some of the

6
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:30,570
anti-derivatives.
If the derivative of sine is cosine, then

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,533
the anti-derivative of cosine is sine plus
C.

8
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:39,766
And if the derivative of negative cosine
is sine.

9
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:45,044
That means the anti-derivative of sine is
negative cosine plus c.

10
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:50,472
Well what about tangent?
What would I differentiate to get tangent

11
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:53,796
of x?
Yeah, I'm asking what do I differentiate

12
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:57,953
to get tangent or what's the
anti-derivative of tangent?

13
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:05,014
I'm claiming, that the antiderivative of
tangent is log secant x, plus some

14
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:08,164
constant.
How do I know this?

15
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:13,060
Well, to verify this is true, it's enough
to do a differentiation problem.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,343
I need to check that the derivative of log
of secant of x Is equal to tan of x.

17
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:23,000
And how do I know this?
Well I have to differentiate this

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,310
composition of functions.
The composition of log and secant,.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,046
Which I'll do in the chain rule, right.
So what's the derivative of log?

20
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,656
It's one over.
So it's 1 over the inside function times

21
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:38,519
the derivative of secant.
What's the derivative of secant?

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,212
It's secant tangent.
Alright, so this is 1 over secant times

23
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:49,309
secant x times tangent x.
Now good news the secants cancel.

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,512
And what I'm left with is just tangent x.
So I've found an antiderivative for

25
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:59,435
tangent.
But it's totally opaque as to how somebody

26
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:03,544
would ever have gotten that as the
anti-derivative of tangent.

27
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:07,506
And yet, once that candidate
anti-derivative was revealed to us, we can

28
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:12,126
verify that it's truly an anti-derivative
just by differentiating it and checking

29
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:15,751
that it really gives us tangent.
Ok, let's try another one of these kinds

30
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,229
of problems.
What's an anti-derivative of secant?

31
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,814
So I'm asking for a function, whose
derivative is secant x.

32
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,124
Right?
I'm looking for the antiderivative of

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,887
secant x.
What is that?

34
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:29,761
Well it turns out that the antiderivative
of secant x is this.

35
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,330
It's log, the absolute value of secant x
plus tangent x.

36
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,770
Now again, it's totally mysterious, right,
where this came from.

37
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,906
But we can verify that that's truly an
antiderivative.

38
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:44,191
So to verify that the antiderivative of
secant x is this, it's enough to

39
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,817
differentiate this and end up with secant
x.

40
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:52,405
So let's try that, alright?
I'll differentiate log of the absolute

41
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,303
value of secant x plus tangent x and what
do I get?

42
00:02:56,304 --> 00:03:01,914
Well, the derivative of log is 1 over the
inside function, which is secant x plus

43
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:06,122
tangent x.
Times the derivative of the inside

44
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,924
function.
This is really the chain rule in action.

45
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:12,839
All right.
Now, what's the derivative of this sum?

46
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,406
Well, that's the sum of derivatives,
right?

47
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:20,453
So the derivative of secant is secant x
tangent x.

48
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:30,041
And the derivative of, tangent.
Is secant squared, and this is divided by

49
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:37,612
secant x plus tangent x.
Now note I can factor out a secant x here,

50
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:44,064
and I've got secant x times the numerator
is tangent x plus secant x.

51
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:48,253
The denominator's the same thing.
I mean I wrote it in the opposite order.

52
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:53,430
But now this is great, right?
This cancels and what I'm left with is

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,478
secant x.
So yeah, the derivative of this is secant

54
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:02,010
x and consequently the antiderivative of
secant x is this.

55
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,731
This is really a key in to anti
multiplying, to factoring.

56
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:10,051
If you remember our experience,
multiplying and anti-multiplying, or

57
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,914
factoring numbers, right.
Factoring was hard.

58
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:16,754
I had to do a bunch of trial division to
figure out how to factor a number.

59
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,979
But once I had that factorization, or
purported factorization, in hand, then

60
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,944
checking it was easy.
Multiplying is something that you can do.

61
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:28,024
It's the same story here with derivatives,
right.

62
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,675
Anti differentiating is hard, I mean it
seems hard to figure out what the anti

63
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:35,771
differentiating derivative is.
But once you show me a guess, I can verify

64
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,571
that your guess is correct by doing the
easy step of just differentiating and

65
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,434
seeing if you're right.
I hope that these examples are giving you

66
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:47,554
some real respect for the true
difficulties of anti-differentiation.

67
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:52,606
Differentiating is a mechanical process.
You just have to apply the rules

68
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,354
carefully.
But we've seen now that

69
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:58,842
anti-differentiation requires flashes of
insight, just cooking up the correct

70
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,452
answer and then verifying that it's
correct.

71
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:04,492
Well this seems, you know, impossible to
continue, right?

72
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:08,852
How can we ever find anti-derivatives if
we just have to keep hoping for insight to

73
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:11,510
appear?
Well the good news is that most of the

74
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,190
rest of this course will be developing
tools to make this kind of guessing more

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,790
systematic right?
Instead of relying on just sheer insight

76
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,213
to solve these problems.
We're going to be providing tools that

77
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:26,753
will aid your insight or aid your
creativity, or provide a little bit of

78
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:30,593
structure so that you can exploit the
patterns that we're going to be seeing,

79
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:33,320
and order the finite derivatives much more
easily.

80
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:44,233
So I think it seems hard right now, but
it's going to get a lot easier.
