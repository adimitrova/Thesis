music now, weve seen to 
antidifferentiate trig functions 
polynomials 
we antidifferentiate, say, e to x 
so, general antiderivative e 
to x, is e to x plus 
constant c 
i know that 
derivative e to x is 
consequently antiderivative e to 
x must also 
plus single constant c 
since this is a function to find in a 
whole real line, well, great, weve found 
an antiderivative e to x 
an antiderivative log 
so, in symbols, right, im looking 
is an antiderivative natural 
log x, right, function that 
differentiates natural log x 
we ever differentiated anything 
got log answer 
knows 
turns that derivative x 
log x is so far off, right 
this is a derivative product, so 
product rule, first thing times 
derivative second plus 
derivative first thing times 
second thing, right 
so, derivative x times log x is 
plus log x, so far 
now, you kind tweak this a little 
bit, right 
whats derivative x log x minus x 
well, thats derivative x log x 
minus derivative x is 
ive calculated derivative 
x log x 
plus log x minus , 
im left is log x, right 
so, derivative x log x minus x is 
log x 
so, in light that, we summarize 
situation follows 
so, yes, i mean, in, in light this, i 
say that antiderivative 
natural log is x times natural log x 
minus x plus constant c 
this is so awful 
so depressing 
you know, answers coming, 
theyre coming void 
i mean, theyre answers without 
meaning structure 
finding antiderivatives 
really clever guessing, you know, 
doesnt seem obvious anyone would 
ever cook answers 
i mean, if, if youre feeling really 
depressed right now, you probably 

you know, this is really bad
