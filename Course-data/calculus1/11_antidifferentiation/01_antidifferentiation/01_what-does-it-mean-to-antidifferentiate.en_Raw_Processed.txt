weve done a ton differentiating in 
this course 
weve learned rules taking 
derivatives, 
weve studying a bunch 
applications differentiation 
things like optimization problems 
now, i want to take this 
differentiation stuff run in 
reverse 
i want to antidifferentiation 
well, is antidifferentiation 
differentiating, 
taking derivatives 
that means im giving you functions 
youre giving derivative 
i ask you to antidifferentiate, i 
want you to that in reverse 
i want to give you a function 
i want you to give a 
function whose derivative is function 
i gave you 
thats antidifferentiating 
starting derivative, figuring 
function would 
i to differentiate to get that, 
derivative 
turns thats quite a bit harder 
differentiating 
matter complicated an expression i 
gave 
you, i know that you differentiate 
you to carefully apply rules 
differentiation 
you know, things like sum rule, 
product 
rule, quotient rule, chain rule, 
derivatives 
certain transcendental functions i 
know that you 
it, a matter applying 
rules 
might complicated doable 
in contrast, antidifferentiating doesnt 
really 
so may rules associated 
involves a lot creativity, 
therefore, i think a lot fun 
course, if going to complicated 
we 
ask all, 
you know 
whats point undoing 
differentiation 
would you want to antidifferentiate 
in first place 
well, turns that 
antidifferentiation is like 
a bridge between two different parts 
this course 
until now, weve really looking 
at, differentiation 
then, end this course gets 
integration, this theory of, areas, 
if you like 
a huge surprise is that 
antidifferentiation will let us solve 
integration problems that coming 
end this course 
so you really think 
antidifferentiation a sort bridge 
between 
the, differentiation section this 
course, 
integration section this 
course 
thats a story thats yet to come 
now, i want to focus 
antidifferentiation
