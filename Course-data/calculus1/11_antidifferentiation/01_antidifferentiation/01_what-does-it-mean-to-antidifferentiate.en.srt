2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,342
We've done a ton of differentiating in
this course.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,351
We've learned all these rules for taking
derivatives, and

4
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:15,720
we've been studying a bunch of
applications of differentiation.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,530
And things like optimization problems.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,360
But now, I want to take all this

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,040
differentiation stuff and run it in
reverse.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,180
I want to do anti-differentiation.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,625
Well, what is anti-differentiation?

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,150
When we're just differentiating, we're
just taking derivatives.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,200
That means I'm giving you functions and
you're giving me the derivative.

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,470
When I ask you to anti-differentiate, I
want you to do that in reverse.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,320
I want to give you a function.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,300
And then I want you to give me a

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,930
function whose derivative is the function
I gave you.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,210
That's anti-differentiating.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,620
Starting with the derivative, and figuring
out what function would

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,149
I have to differentiate to get that, as
its derivative.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,850
It turns out thatâs quite a bit harder
than just differentiating.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,260
No matter how complicated an expression I
gave

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,280
you, I know that you can differentiate it.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,270
You just have to carefully apply the rules
of differentiation.

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,260
You know, things like the sum rule, the
product

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,970
rule, the quotient rule, the chain rule,
derivatives of

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,860
certain transcendental functions but I
know that you can

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,430
do it, it's just a matter of applying
those rules.

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,608
It might be complicated but it's doable.

28
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:30,822
In contrast, anti-differentiating doesn't
really have

29
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:33,530
so may rules associated with it.

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,140
It involves a lot more creativity, and
therefore, I think it's a lot more fun.

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,630
Of course, if it's going to be complicated
we should

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,070
ask ourselves why we're doing it at all,
you know?

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,310
What's the point of undoing
differentiation?

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,920
Why would you want to anti-differentiate
in the first place?

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
Well, it turns out that
anti-differentiation is like

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,459
a bridge between two different parts of
this course.

37
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,690
Up until now, we've really been looking
at, at differentiation.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,750
And then, the end of this course gets into

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,330
integration, and this theory of, of areas,
if you like.

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:16,170
A huge surprise is that
anti-differentiation will let us solve the

41
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,090
integration problems that are coming up at
the end of this course.

42
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,285
So you can really think of

43
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,580
anti-differentiation as a sort of bridge
between

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,690
the, the differentiation section of this
course,

45
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,990
and the integration section of this
course.

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,420
That's a story that's yet to come.

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,387
For now, I just want to focus on
anti-differentiation.
