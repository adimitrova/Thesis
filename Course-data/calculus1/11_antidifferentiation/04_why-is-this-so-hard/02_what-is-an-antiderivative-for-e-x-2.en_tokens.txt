differentiating
is
a
process
really
guaranteed
to
work
.
alright
,
if
somebody
writes
down
a
function
and
asks
you
to
differentiate
it
.
you
can
.
it
might
be
painful
,
alright
,
it
might
involve
a
lot
of
steps
but
it
's
just
a
matter
of
applying
those
steps
carefully
.
in
contrast
antidifferentiation
might
be
really
hard
.
let
's
try
a
really
hard
example
now
.
for
instance
,
can
you
find
some
function
so
if
i
differentiate
that
function
,
i
get
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
?
which
is
just
another
way
of
saying
,
i
want
to
anti-differentiate
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
.
right
,
what
is
that
?
well
,
let
's
make
a
guess
and
see
if
our
guess
is
correct
.
i
mean
maybe
,
an
antiderivative
of
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
is
i
do
n't
know
,
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
,
over
minus
2
x
plus
c
,
right
.
i
mean
i
'm
not
saying
this
is
correct
,
but
it
could
be
true
.
if
this
were
the
case
,
i
can
check
it
,
right
.
i
can
differentiate
this
side
and
see
if
i
get
this
.
so
let
's
differentiate
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
over
minus
2
x.
that
's
sort
of
the
same
thing
as
differentiating
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
times
minus
2
x
to
the
negative
1st
power
.
so
that
's
a
derivative
of
a
product
,
which
is
assuming
the
product
rule
's
good
for
,
right
?
so
first
i
'll
differentiate
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
.
and
i
'll
multiply
that
by
the
second
term
minus
two
x
to
the
minus
1st
power
and
i
'll
add
to
that
the
first
term
,
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
times
the
derivative
of
the
second
term
,
which
is
minus
two
x
to
the
minus
1st
power
.
but
what
's
the
derivative
of
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
?
that
's
e
to
the
minus
x
square
cause
the
derivative
of
e
to
the
is
e
to
the
.
times
the
derivative
of
minus
x
squared
which
is
minus
2
x.
and
then
it
's
times
negative
2
x
to
the
negative
1st
power
,
right
?
plus
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
times
the
derivative
of
minus
2
x
to
the
minus
1st
power
.
i
'll
just
copy
that
down
and
we
'll
deal
with
it
in
a
second
.
because
this
is
pretty
exciting
right
here
right
.
this
term
cancels
,
this
term
cancels
,
this
is
looking
pretty
good
right
.
maybe
the
antiderivative
of
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
really
is
this
.
because
when
i
differentiate
this
thing
,
at
least
i
get
a
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
.
the
bad
news
is
that
i
also
get
this
term
,
right
.
and
this
terms
out
to
be
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
,
now
i
got
ta
deal
with
this
.
it
's
again
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
and
then
times
the
derivative
of
this
.
well
,
when
i
differentiate
this
,
i
get
a
negative
sign
times
this
thing
to
the
negative
2nd
power
,
right
?
and
then
by
the
chain
rule
,
the
derivative
of
the
inside
,
which
is
negative
2.
and
yeah
,
i
mean
this
is
,
this
is
bad
right
.
i
mean
i
differentiated
this
thing
right
here
and
i
got
back
some
of
that
included
in
the
e
to
the
minus
x
squared
but
also
includes
non
zero
term
.
so
as
result
this
is
not
the
case
.
well
that
did
n't
work
but
it
was
n't
from
lack
trying
.
in
fact
,
an
antiderivative
for
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
can
not
be
expressed
using
elementary
functions
.
what
do
i
mean
by
elementary
functions
?
i
mean
things
like
polynomials
,
trig
functions
,
e
to
the
x
,
log
,
things
like
that
,
right
?
i
mean
,
this
is
really
a
surprising
result
.
i
mean
there
is
a
function
whose
derivative
is
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
,
but
it
's
not
a
function
i
can
write
down
.
using
the
functions
that
i
already
have
in
hand
.
may
be
e
to
the
negative
x
squared
just
an
isolated
terrible
example
.
i
ca
n't
answer
differentiate
e
to
the
e
to
the
x
using
elementary
functions
.
i
ca
n't
answer
differentiate
log
,
log
x
using
elementary
functions
.
i
ca
n't
even
answer
differentiate
this
very
reasonable
looking
algebraic
function
.
the
square
root
of
1
plus
x
to
the
4th
.
i
ca
n't
find
an
anti-derivative
of
this
just
using
elementary
functions
.
so
,
what
does
this
mean
?
let
's
try
to
summarize
the
situation
.
it
's
not
just
that
many
functions
are
hard
to
antidifferentiate
.
it
's
that
many
functions
are
impossible
to
antidifferentiate
,
not
in
the
sense
that
they
do
n't
have
an
antiderivative
.
but
in
the
sense
that
we
're
not
going
to
succeed
in
writing
down
that
antiderivative
using
the
functions
that
we
have
at
hand
.
in
light
of
the
difficulties
of
antidifferentiating
,
the
fact
that
there
's
no
guaranteed
answer
,
it
means
that
we
should
be
happy
that
we
can
ever
evaluate
an
antiderivative
problem
right
.
it
also
reflects
the
fact
that
some
real
creativity
is
needed
.
you
know
,
if
an
answer
's
not
guaranteed
then
potentially
we
're
going
to
require
more
creativity
to
cook
up
the
answers
,
even
when
they
exist
.
