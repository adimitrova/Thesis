music differentiating is a process 
really guaranteed to work 
alright, if somebody writes a 
function asks you to differentiate 
you 
might painful, alright, might 
involve a lot steps a 
matter applying steps carefully 
in contrast antidifferentiation might 
really hard 
lets try a really hard example 
instance, you find function 
so if i differentiate that function, i get 
e to negative x squared 
is another way saying, i 
want to antidifferentiate e to 
negative x squared 
right, is that 
well, lets make a guess see if 
guess is correct 
i mean maybe, an antiderivative e to 
negative x squared is i dont know, e 
to negative x squared, minus x 
plus c, right 
i mean im saying this is correct, 
could true 
if this case, i check it, 
right 
i differentiate this side see if i 
get this 
so lets differentiate e to minus x 
squared minus x 
thats sort thing 
differentiating e to minus x squared 
times minus x to negative st power 
so thats a derivative a product, 
is assuming product rules good for, 
right 
so first ill differentiate e to minus 
x squared 
ill multiply that second term 
minus two x to minus st power 
ill add to that first term, e to 
minus x squared times derivative 
second term, is minus two x to 
minus st power 
whats derivative e to 
minus x squared 
thats e to minus x square cause 
derivative e to is e to 
times derivative minus x squared 
is minus x 
times negative x to 
negative st power, right 
plus e to minus x squared times 
derivative minus x to minus st 
power 
ill copy that well deal 
in a second 
this is pretty exciting right here 
right 
this term cancels, this term cancels, this 
is looking pretty good right 
maybe antiderivative e to minus 
x squared really is this 
i differentiate this thing, 
least i get a e to minus x squared 
bad news is that i also get this term, 
right 
this terms to e to minus x 
squared, i gotta deal this 
e to minus x squared 
times derivative this 
well, i differentiate this, i get a 
negative sign times this thing to 
negative nd power, right 
chain rule, derivative 
inside, is negative 
yeah, i mean this is, this is bad 
right 
i mean i differentiated this thing right 
here i got back that included 
in e to minus x squared also 
includes non zero term 
so result this is case 
well that didnt work wasnt 
lack trying 
in fact, an antiderivative e to 
negative x squared cannot expressed 
using elementary functions 
i mean elementary functions 
i mean things like polynomials, trig 
functions, e to x, log, things like 
that, right 
i mean, this is really a surprising 
result 
i mean there is a function whose 
derivative is e to negative x squared, 
a function i write 
using functions that i already in 
hand 
may e to negative x squared an 
isolated terrible example 
i cant answer differentiate e to e to 
x using elementary functions 
i cant answer differentiate log, log x 
using elementary functions 
i cant even answer differentiate this 
reasonable looking algebraic 
function 
square root plus x to th 
i cant find an antiderivative this 
using elementary functions 
so, this mean 
lets try to summarize situation 
that many functions hard 
to antidifferentiate 
that many functions impossible to 
antidifferentiate, in sense that 
dont an antiderivative 
in sense that going to 
succeed in writing that 
antiderivative using functions that we 
hand 
in light difficulties 
antidifferentiating, fact that theres 
guaranteed answer, means that we 
happy that we ever evaluate 
an antiderivative problem right 
also reflects fact that real 
creativity is needed 
you know, if an answers guaranteed 
potentially going to require 
creativity to cook answers, 
even exist
