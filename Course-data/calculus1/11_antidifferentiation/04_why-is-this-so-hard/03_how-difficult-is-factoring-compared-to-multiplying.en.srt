[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:11,230
Here is an ancient saying,
it is easier to destroy than to create.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,240
Through mathematical instances
of this too like multiplying

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,650
as compared to antimultiplying.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,960
What is antimultiplying?

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,120
Normal people wouldn't talk
about antimultiplying.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,304
They'd talk about factoring.

8
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,660
Here's an example.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:37,490
Suppose somebody gives you a number
like 247 to antimultiply that number,

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,900
which is just my crazy way of
saying factoring this number.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,872
Means I want to write this as
something times something else.

12
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:50,118
And yeah, you can sort of play
around with this and try diving

13
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:54,695
this by various numbers, and you'll
eventually hit on 247 being 13 times 19.

14
00:00:54,695 --> 00:01:00,495
Well, that seemed to
have come out of nowhere.

15
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,285
How did I figure that out?

16
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:04,574
Well, basically I just have to
keep trying to divide, right?

17
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:11,875
So to figure this out,
maybe I'd first see is 247 divisible by 3?

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:18,630
Well, 3 goes into 247 82 times,
but there's a remainder of 1.

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,650
So 82 time three isn't 247,
I've got that pesky remainder.

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,090
Maybe I'll try five,
does five go into 247?

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,610
Well clearly not, because the last
digit's not a zero or a five, right?

22
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,955
How many times does five
go into this thing?

23
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:37,620
I guess 49 times, and I get 245 and
that gives me a remainder of 2.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,540
Does seven go into 247?

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,108
That's a lot harder to see
if 7 divides this number.

26
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:47,900
7 goes into this thing 35 times but

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,990
35 times 7 is 245 so
again there's a remainder of 2.

28
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Does 11 go into this thing?

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,317
Does 11 go into 247?

30
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:06,670
It goes in there 22 times,
but 22 times 11 is 242.

31
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,640
Which again leaves me with a remainder,
in this case a remainder of 5.

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,760
And finally, I get to 13.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,740
Does 13 go into 247?

34
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,710
Yes, 13 goes into this thing 19 times,
right?

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,470
And that's exactly what I'm looking for.

36
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,840
But the easy way here to antimultiply, or

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,150
to factor,
is just to try a bunch of stuff.

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,930
And hopefully,

39
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,430
you'll land on a product of numbers
that multiplies to your given number.

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,090
Why is factoring so difficult?

41
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,640
Yeah, so what we just saw is
that it was hard to factor 247.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,990
It's hard to write this number as
a product of two other numbers.

43
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,380
But if somebody comes up to you and asks
you to check that 19 x 13 is equal to 247,

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,920
well that's super easy, right?

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,510
I can do this multiplication problem,
right?

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,828
9 times 3 is 27, 3 times 1 plus 2,

47
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:06,080
1 times 19, right, and I add.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,790
And yeah, I mean, I get 247, right?

49
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,480
So it's easy to verify if I'm told the
answer that these numbers multiply to 247.

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,600
But it took some guessing, really, to
figure out that 247 factored in this way.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,990
Well this is an example where undoing
an operation is much harder than just

52
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,050
performing that operation.

53
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,960
All right, here's a piece of paper.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,930
It's very easy for
me to rip the piece of paper.

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,770
It's harder for
me to unrip the piece of paper.

56
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,070
And honestly, 247's not even that bad.

57
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,950
Take a look at this number, 311,512,699.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,270
It turns out right that this number is
the product of two other whole numbers.

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,960
It turns out this is 17,551 times 17,749,

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,220
but how would you ever have known that?

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,480
It would have been a real
pain to do a bunch of tests

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,860
to see which numbers divide this number.

63
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,170
And since these two numbers are prime,

64
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,100
there's no other smaller numbers
that go into this number evenly.

65
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,910
So it would have been a ton of work.

66
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,090
And yet, if somebody tells you,
do these two numbers multiplied to this,

67
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,000
that is easy to verify, because you can
just multiply these two numbers and

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,710
check that they really
give you this number.

69
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,670
But undoing that multiplication,
starting with this number and

70
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,310
trying to find these two numbers,
would really be a pain.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,320
Now, in that situation, a computer could
just search for the factorization.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,190
But what if I gave you a number
that was much, much bigger?

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,980
Well, here's a 240 digit
number that I've cooked up.

74
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,560
I got this number by taking two prime
numbers and multiplying them together.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,740
Probably I'm the only person on Earth who
knows the factorization of that number.

76
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,400
I got that number by taking
two big prime numbers and

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,700
multiplying them together, but nobody else
but me knows what those prime numbers are.

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,030
For someone else to come along and

79
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,290
find those two factors
would be really difficult.

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,490
The cool consequence is that if I were
to reveal to you the factorization

81
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,500
of that large number, well that would be
evidence that I'm really who I say I am.

82
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,359
Because who else in the world knows
the factorization of that enormous number.
