we
've
already
seen
anti-derivatives
for
sine
and
for
cosine
,
so
what
's
an
anti-derivative
for
say
,
cosine
3x
?
right
?
i
'm
looking
for
some
function
that
differentiates
to
cosine
3x
.
well
,
there
's
basically
one
trick
that
we
've
been
using
throughout
all
of
these
anti-differentiation
problems
.
it
's
guessing
.
sine
differentiates
to
cosine
,
so
maybe
sine
of
3x
is
a
good
guess
.
but
if
i
differentiate
sine
of
3x
using
the
chain
rule
,
i
get
the
derivative
of
the
outside
function
,
that
's
looking
good
,
at
the
inside
function
,
that
's
looking
good
,
too
.
but
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
which
is
3.
so
that
's
no
good
,
but
i
can
fix
that
pretty
easily
,
right
?
if
i
just
include
a
1
3rd
here
,
that
rigs
up
everything
perfectly
,
right
?
because
then
the
1
3rd
here
and
the
3
cancel
,
and
i
am
left
with
cosine
of
3x
.
so
,
i
can
summarize
this
by
saying
that
an
anti-derivative
for
cosine
3x
is
1
3rd
sine
3x
.
and
then
,
to
get
in
the
other
anti-derivative
,
i
just
add
some
locally
constant
function
c.
well
,
that
worked
out
.
let
's
try
to
do
a
slightly
harder
example
.
let
's
try
to
anti-differentiate
say
,
sine
of
2x
plus
1.
alright
,
i
'm
looking
for
some
function
which
differentiates
to
2x
plus
1.
i
might
guess
that
the
answer
will
involve
cosine
.
well
,
i
know
that
cosine
differentiates
to
minus
sine
.
so
,
my
first
guess
might
be
cosine
of
2x
plus
1.
because
if
i
differentiate
this
,
i
get
minus
sine
of
the
inside
function
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
.
so
,
this
is
not
exactly
this
,
so
i
have
n't
quite
found
an
anti-derivative
.
but
,
it
'll
be
easy
to
patch
that
up
,
right
?
if
i
instead
look
at
a
slightly
different
function
.
if
i
include
a
factor
of
minus
1
half
in
front
of
cosine
of
2x
plus
1
,
then
the
derivative
would
be
minus
1
half
times
the
derivative
of
cosine
2x
plus
1
,
which
is
minus
sine
2x
plus
1
times
2.
and
now
,
the
good
news
is
that
the
minus
1
half
,
and
this
minus
sign
and
this
2
cancel
,
and
what
i
'm
left
with
then
is
just
sine
of
2x
plus
1
which
means
i
've
found
an
anti-derivative
,
right
?
an
anti-derivative
for
sine
of
2x
plus
1
is
,
according
to
this
argument
,
negative
1
half
cosine
2x
plus
1
,
plus
some
constant
c.
i
can
see
a
bit
of
a
general
principle
here
.
well
,
here
's
our
set
up
.
i
've
got
m
and
b
,
just
a
couple
of
constants
.
and
what
i
want
to
do
is
anti-differentiate
a
function
evaluated
at
mx
plus
b.
alright
,
this
is
the
general
framework
that
's
general
enough
to
encompass
the
examples
we
've
done
thus
far
,
right
?
f
could
be
say
,
sine
or
cosine
.
in
our
first
example
,
we
looked
at
cosine
of
3x
,
so
m
was
3
and
b
was
0.
in
our
second
example
,
we
looked
at
sine
of
2x
plus
1
,
so
m
was
2
and
b
was
1
and
f
was
sine
.
but
,
this
is
sort
of
a
general
example
that
encompasses
some
of
the
specific
example
which
we
're
already
taking
a
look
at
.
let
's
suppose
that
you
already
have
an
anti-derivative
for
f.
yeah
,
let
's
suppose
that
i
know
how
to
anti-differentiate
just
f
,
and
let
's
call
that
f
,
right
?
so
,
the
derivative
of
f
is
f.
now
,
how
do
i
deal
with
the
mx
plus
b
part
?
well
basically
,
we
're
trying
to
guess
.
what
i
'm
trying
to
find
some
function
that
differentiates
to
this
,
and
i
've
got
a
function
that
just
differentiates
to
just
f.
so
,
let
's
see
what
happens
if
i
differentiate
f
of
mx
plus
b
by
using
the
chain
rule
.
well
,
the
derivative
of
f
is
f
,
evaluated
the
inside
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
,
which
is
just
m.
now
,
i
can
fix
this
if
i
include
a
factor
of
1
over
m
here
.
then
,
i
get
a
factor
of
1
over
m
here
.
and
that
's
great
because
then
this
1
over
m
,
and
this
m
cancel
.
so
here
,
i
've
got
a
function
whose
derivative
is
f
of
mx
plus
b.
in
other
words
,
the
anti-derivative
of
f
of
mx
plus
b
is
this
,
right
?
it
's
f
of
mx
plus
b
divided
by
m
plus
c.
instead
of
always
just
relying
on
guessing
and
hoping
that
we
can
guess
the
correct
anti-derivative
,
we
're
going
to
be
learning
more
and
more
general
techniques
along
these
lines
.
the
big
one
will
go
by
the
name
substitution
,
or
the
chain
rule
in
reverse
.
and
as
we
develop
more
and
more
of
these
anti-differentiation
techniques
in
our
tool
box
,
we
'll
be
able
to
anti-differentiate
a
whole
lot
more
functions
without
relying
on
just
flashes
of
insight
.
