music weve already seen 
antiderivatives sine cosine, 
so whats an antiderivative say, 
cosine x 
right 
im looking function that 
differentiates to cosine x 
well, theres basically one trick that 
weve using throughout 
antidifferentiation problems 
guessing 
sine differentiates to cosine, so maybe 
sine x is a good guess 
if i differentiate sine x using 
chain rule, i get derivative 
outside function, thats looking good, 
inside function, thats looking 
good, 
times derivative inside 
function is 
so thats good, i fix that 
pretty easily, right 
if i include a rd here, that rigs 
everything perfectly, right 
rd here 
cancel, i left cosine x 
so, i summarize this saying that an 
antiderivative cosine x is rd 
sine x 
then, to get in 
antiderivative, i add locally 
constant function c 
well, that worked 
lets try to a slightly harder example 
lets try to antidifferentiate say, sine 
x plus 
alright, im looking function 
differentiates to x plus 
i might guess that answer will involve 
cosine 
well, i know that cosine differentiates to 
minus sine 
so, first guess might cosine x 
plus 
if i differentiate this, i get 
minus sine inside function, times 
derivative inside function 
so, this is exactly this, so i havent 
quite found an antiderivative 
but, itll easy to patch that up, 
right 
if i instead look a slightly different 
function 
if i include a factor minus half in 
front cosine x plus , 
derivative would minus half times 
derivative cosine x plus , is 
minus sine x plus times 
now, good news is that minus 
half, this minus sign this 
cancel, im left is 
sine x plus means ive 
found an antiderivative, right 
an antiderivative sine x plus 
is, according to this argument, negative 
half cosine x plus , plus constant 
c 
i see a bit a general principle 
here 
well, heres set 
ive got m b, a couple 
constants 
i want to is 
antidifferentiate a function evaluated 
mx plus b 
alright, this is general framework 
thats general enough to encompass 
examples weve done thus far, right 
f could say, sine cosine 
in first example, we looked cosine 
x, so m b 
in second example, we looked sine 
x plus , so m b f 
sine 
but, this is sort a general example 
that encompasses specific 
example already taking a look 

lets suppose that you already an 
antiderivative f 
yeah, lets suppose that i know to 
antidifferentiate f, lets call 
that f, right 
so, derivative f is f 
now, i deal mx plus b 
part 
well basically, trying to guess 
im trying to find function that 
differentiates to this, ive got a 
function that differentiates to 
f 
so, lets see happens if i 
differentiate f mx plus b using 
chain rule 
well, derivative f is f, evaluated 
inside times derivative 
inside, is m 
now, i fix this if i include a factor 
m here 
then, i get a factor m here 
thats great this 
m, this m cancel 
so here, ive got a function whose 
derivative is f mx plus b 
in words, antiderivative f 
mx plus b is this, right 
f mx plus b divided m plus c 
instead always relying guessing 
hoping that we guess correct 
antiderivative, going to 
learning general techniques 
along lines 
big one will go name 
substitution, chain rule in 
reverse 
we develop 
antidifferentiation techniques in 
tool box, well able to 
antidifferentiate a whole lot 
functions without relying flashes 
insight
