1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,300
[music] Differentiating is a process
really guaranteed to work.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,990
Alright, if somebody writes down a
function and asks you to differentiate it.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,270
You can.
It might be painful, alright, it might

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,813
involve a lot of steps but it's just a
matter of applying those steps carefully.

5
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:20,870
In contrast antidifferentiation might be
really hard.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,762
Let's try a really hard example now.
For instance, can you find some function

7
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:30,065
so if I differentiate that function, I get
e to the negative x squared?

8
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:34,446
Which is just another way of saying, I
want to anti-differentiate e to the

9
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,816
negative x squared.
Right, what is that?

10
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:40,638
Well, let's make a guess and see if our
guess is correct.

11
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:47,506
I mean maybe, an antiderivative of e to
the negative x squared is I don't know, e

12
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:52,062
to the negative x squared, over minus 2 x
plus c, right.

13
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:55,367
I mean I'm not saying this is correct, but
it could be true.

14
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:57,533
If this were the case, I can check it,
right.

15
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,517
I can differentiate this side and see if I
get this.

16
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:07,487
So let's differentiate e to the minus x
squared over minus 2 x.

17
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:12,719
That's sort of the same thing as
differentiating e to the minus x squared

18
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,181
times minus 2 x to the negative 1st power.
So that's a derivative of a product, which

19
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,954
is assuming the product rule's good for,
right?

20
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:26,449
So first I'll differentiate e to the minus
x squared.

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,324
And I'll multiply that by the second term
minus two x to the minus 1st power and

22
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:37,784
I'll add to that the first term, e to the
minus x squared times the derivative of

23
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:41,958
the second term, which is minus two x to
the minus 1st power.

24
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,442
But what's the derivative of e to the
minus x squared?

25
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:48,900
That's e to the minus x square cause the
derivative of e to the is e to the.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,483
Times the derivative of minus x squared
which is minus 2 x.

27
00:01:52,483 --> 00:02:00,013
And then it's times negative 2 x to the
negative 1st power, right?

28
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:05,306
Plus e to the minus x squared times the
derivative of minus 2 x to the minus 1st

29
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,820
power.
I'll just copy that down and we'll deal

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,911
with it in a second.
Because this is pretty exciting right here

31
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:13,588
right.
This term cancels, this term cancels, this

32
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:17,215
is looking pretty good right.
Maybe the antiderivative of e to the minus

33
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:20,682
x squared really is this.
Because when I differentiate this thing,

34
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,973
at least I get a e to the minus x squared.
The bad news is that I also get this term,

35
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,090
right.
And this terms out to be e to the minus x

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,105
squared, now I gotta deal with this.
It's again e to the minus x squared and

37
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:38,406
then times the derivative of this.
Well, when I differentiate this, I get a

38
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:43,250
negative sign times this thing to the
negative 2nd power, right?

39
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:48,567
And then by the chain rule, the derivative
of the inside, which is negative 2.

40
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:52,840
And yeah, I mean this is, this is bad
right.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,396
I mean I differentiated this thing right
here and I got back some of that included

42
00:02:57,396 --> 00:03:01,070
in the e to the minus x squared but also
includes non zero term.

43
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,305
So as result this is not the case.
Well that didn't work but it wasn't from

44
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,878
lack trying.
In fact, an antiderivative for e to the

45
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,930
negative x squared cannot be expressed
using elementary functions.

46
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,975
What do I mean by elementary functions?
I mean things like polynomials, trig

47
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,983
functions, e to the x, log, things like
that, right?

48
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,385
I mean, this is really a surprising
result.

49
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:28,416
I mean there is a function whose
derivative is e to the negative x squared,

50
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:33,180
but it's not a function I can write down.
Using the functions that I already have in

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,226
hand.
May be e to the negative x squared just an

52
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:41,096
isolated terrible example.
I can't answer differentiate e to the e to

53
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:45,586
the x using elementary functions.
I can't answer differentiate log, log x

54
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:49,157
using elementary functions.
I can't even answer differentiate this

55
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:51,480
very reasonable looking algebraic
function.

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,759
The square root of 1 plus x to the 4th.
I can't find an anti-derivative of this

57
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,000
just using elementary functions.
So, what does this mean?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,270
Let's try to summarize the situation.
It's not just that many functions are hard

59
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,144
to antidifferentiate.
It's that many functions are impossible to

60
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:12,354
antidifferentiate, not in the sense that
they don't have an antiderivative.

61
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:16,106
But in the sense that we're not going to
succeed in writing down that

62
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:19,377
antiderivative using the functions that we
have at hand.

63
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:23,550
In light of the difficulties of
antidifferentiating, the fact that there's

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,840
no guaranteed answer, it means that we
should be happy that we can ever evaluate

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,111
an antiderivative problem right.
It also reflects the fact that some real

66
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:38,002
creativity is needed.
You know, if an answer's not guaranteed

67
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:46,913
then potentially we're going to require
more creativity to cook up the answers,

68
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,333
even when they exist.
