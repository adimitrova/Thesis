here is an ancient saying, 
is easier to destroy to create 
mathematical instances 
this like multiplying 
compared to antimultiplying 
is antimultiplying 
normal people wouldnt talk 
antimultiplying 
theyd talk factoring 
heres an example 
suppose somebody gives you a number 
like to antimultiply that number, 
is crazy way 
saying factoring this number 
means i want to write this 
something times something else 
yeah, you sort play 
around this try diving 
this various numbers, youll 
eventually hit times 
well, that seemed to 
come nowhere 
i figure that 
well, basically i to 
keep trying to divide, right 
so to figure this out, 
maybe id first see is divisible 
well, goes times, 
theres a remainder 
so time three isnt , 
ive got that pesky remainder 
maybe ill try five, 
five go 
well clearly not, last 
digits a zero a five, right 
many times five 
go this thing 
i guess times, i get 
that gives a remainder 
seven go 
thats a lot harder to see 
if divides this number 
goes this thing times 
times is so 
theres a remainder 
go this thing 
go 
goes in there times, 
times is 
leaves a remainder, 
in this case a remainder 
finally, i get to 
go 
yes, goes this thing times, 
right 
thats exactly im looking 
easy way here to antimultiply, 
to factor, 
is to try a bunch stuff 
hopefully, 
youll land a product numbers 
that multiplies to given number 
is factoring so difficult 
yeah, so we saw is 
that hard to factor 
hard to write this number 
a product two numbers 
if somebody comes to you asks 
you to check that x is equal to , 
well thats super easy, right 
i this multiplication problem, 
right 
times is , times plus , 
times , right, i add 
yeah, i mean, i get , right 
so easy to verify if im told 
answer that numbers multiply to 
took guessing, really, to 
figure that factored in this way 
well this is an example undoing 
an operation is much harder 
performing that operation 
right, heres a piece paper 
easy 
to rip piece paper 
harder 
to unrip piece paper 
honestly, even that bad 
take a look this number, ,, 
turns right that this number is 
product two whole numbers 
turns this is , times ,, 
would you ever known that 
would a real 
pain to a bunch tests 
to see numbers divide this number 
since two numbers prime, 
theres smaller numbers 
that go this number evenly 
so would a ton work 
yet, if somebody tells you, 
two numbers multiplied to this, 
that is easy to verify, you 
multiply two numbers 
check that really 
give you this number 
undoing that multiplication, 
starting this number 
trying to find two numbers, 
would really a pain 
now, in that situation, a computer could 
search factorization 
if i gave you a number 
that much, much bigger 
well, heres a digit 
number that ive cooked 
i got this number taking two prime 
numbers multiplying together 
probably im person earth 
knows factorization that number 
i got that number taking 
two big prime numbers 
multiplying together, nobody else 
knows prime numbers 
someone else to come along 
find two factors 
would really difficult 
cool consequence is that if i 
to reveal to you factorization 
that large number, well that would 
evidence that im really i say i 
else in world knows 
factorization that enormous number
