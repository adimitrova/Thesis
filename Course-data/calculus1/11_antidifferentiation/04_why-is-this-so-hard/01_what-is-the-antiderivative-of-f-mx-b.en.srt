1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:07,911
[music] We've already seen
anti-derivatives for sine and for cosine,

2
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:13,408
so what's an anti-derivative for say,
cosine 3x?

3
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:17,064
Right?
I'm looking for some function that

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:21,486
differentiates to cosine 3x.
Well, there's basically one trick that

5
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,833
we've been using throughout all of these
anti-differentiation problems.

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,154
It's guessing.
Sine differentiates to cosine, so maybe

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,401
sine of 3x is a good guess.
But if I differentiate sine of 3x using

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:38,852
the chain rule, I get the derivative of
the outside function, that's looking good,

9
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:42,428
at the inside function, that's looking
good, too.

10
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:46,703
But times the derivative of the inside
function which is 3.

11
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:50,653
So that's no good, but I can fix that
pretty easily, right?

12
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:57,804
If I just include a 1 3rd here, that rigs
up everything perfectly, right?

13
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:05,485
Because then the 1 3rd here and the 3
cancel, and I am left with cosine of 3x.

14
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:14,924
So, I can summarize this by saying that an
anti-derivative for cosine 3x is 1 3rd

15
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:17,330
sine 3x.
And then, to get in the other

16
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,529
anti-derivative, I just add some locally
constant function c.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,458
Well, that worked out.
Let's try to do a slightly harder example.

18
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:30,386
Let's try to anti-differentiate say, sine
of 2x plus 1.

19
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:37,397
Alright, I'm looking for some function
which differentiates to 2x plus 1.

20
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,185
I might guess that the answer will involve
cosine.

21
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:44,020
Well, I know that cosine differentiates to
minus sine.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,211
So, my first guess might be cosine of 2x
plus 1.

23
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:55,075
Because if I differentiate this, I get
minus sine of the inside function, times

24
00:01:55,075 --> 00:02:00,794
the derivative of the inside function.
So, this is not exactly this, so I haven't

25
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:05,665
quite found an anti-derivative.
But, it'll be easy to patch that up,

26
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:09,211
right?
If I instead look at a slightly different

27
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,115
function.
If I include a factor of minus 1 half in

28
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:19,983
front of cosine of 2x plus 1, then the
derivative would be minus 1 half times the

29
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:25,760
derivative of cosine 2x plus 1, which is
minus sine 2x plus 1 times 2.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,130
And now, the good news is that the minus 1
half, and this minus sign and this 2

31
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,206
cancel, and what I'm left with then is
just sine of 2x plus 1 which means I've

32
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:45,347
found an anti-derivative, right?
An anti-derivative for sine of 2x plus 1

33
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:54,447
is, according to this argument, negative 1
half cosine 2x plus 1, plus some constant

34
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:57,010
c.
I can see a bit of a general principle

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,790
here.
Well, here's our set up.

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,660
I've got m and b, just a couple of
constants.

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,541
And what I want to do is
anti-differentiate a function evaluated at

38
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,786
mx plus b.
Alright, this is the general framework

39
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:16,684
that's general enough to encompass the
examples we've done thus far, right?

40
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:22,302
F could be say, sine or cosine.
In our first example, we looked at cosine

41
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,522
of 3x, so m was 3 and b was 0.
In our second example, we looked at sine

42
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:30,310
of 2x plus 1, so m was 2 and b was 1 and f
was sine.

43
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,531
But, this is sort of a general example
that encompasses some of the specific

44
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,206
example which we're already taking a look
at.

45
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,867
Let's suppose that you already have an
anti-derivative for f.

46
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:47,501
Yeah, let's suppose that I know how to
anti-differentiate just f, and let's call

47
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:52,355
that F, right?
So, the derivative of F is f.

48
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,416
Now, how do I deal with the mx plus b
part?

49
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,875
Well basically, we're trying to guess.
What I'm trying to find some function that

50
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,479
differentiates to this, and I've got a
function that just differentiates to just

51
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,920
f.
So, let's see what happens if I

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,850
differentiate F of mx plus b by using the
chain rule.

53
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,374
Well, the derivative of F is f, evaluated
the inside times the derivative of the

54
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:22,000
inside, which is just m.
Now, I can fix this if I include a factor

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,836
of 1 over m here.
Then, I get a factor of 1 over m here.

56
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:30,158
And that's great because then this 1 over
m, and this m cancel.

57
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:34,477
So here, I've got a function whose
derivative is f of mx plus b.

58
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,574
In other words, the anti-derivative of f
of mx plus b is this, right?

59
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:48,574
It's F of mx plus b divided by m plus c.
Instead of always just relying on guessing

60
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:52,291
and hoping that we can guess the correct
anti-derivative, we're going to be

61
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,380
learning more and more general techniques
along these lines.

62
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,090
The big one will go by the name
substitution, or the chain rule in

63
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,340
reverse.
And as we develop more and more of these

64
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,780
anti-differentiation techniques in our
tool box, we'll be able to

65
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,485
anti-differentiate a whole lot more
functions without relying on just flashes

66
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,700
of insight.
