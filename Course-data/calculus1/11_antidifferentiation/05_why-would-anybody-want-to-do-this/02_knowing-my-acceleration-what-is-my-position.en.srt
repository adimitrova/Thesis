1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:10,126
[music] Maybe I don't know my position and
my velocity, but I know my acceleration.

2
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:16,990
Maybe my acceleration at sometime t is
just a constant 8 units per second

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,838
squared, right?
So, I'm going to accelerate at a constant

4
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:25,432
rate.
Is that enough information to determine my

5
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:28,465
velocity?
We have to think back to how velocity and

6
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:33,036
acceleration are related.
My definition and acceleration is the

7
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:36,422
change to the derivative in velocity,
right.

8
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:39,477
Acceleration is rate of change in
velocity.

9
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:44,680
Or in other words, right, velocity is an
anti-derivative of acceleration.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,336
So, I know that a of t is 8.
Let's now solve for v.

11
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:56,329
Okay, so a of t, my acceleration, is just
constant function 8, and v of t is the

12
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,359
anti-derivative of my acceleration, right.
If I anti-differentiate acceleration, I'm

13
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,084
going to get velocity.
It means I'm anti-differentiating 8.

14
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:12,611
Well what anti-differentiates to 8 or 8t,
plus some constant C?

15
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,824
It's that constant again.
Right?

16
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:20,252
Knowing my acceleration doesn't determine
my velocity, it only determines my

17
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:24,260
velocity up to some constant.
I could be going really fast or really

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,167
slow, but still accelerating at the same
rate.

19
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:30,834
Well, in any case, I've at least got a
formula for my velocity with that

20
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,661
constant.
Now, can I use that formula to determine

21
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,880
my position?
Same kind of game.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,795
My velocity is the rate in change in my
position, right?

23
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:44,376
My velocity is the derivative of position.
And that means position is an

24
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:49,259
anti-derivative of velocity.
So, let's anti-differentiate.

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,766
So, p of t is an anti-derivative of my
velocity, and I figured out my velocity a

26
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,644
minute ago.
My velocity is 8t plus c.

27
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:02,084
So, I want to anti-differentiate 8t plus
c.

28
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:05,136
Well, it's an anti-derivative of a sum, so
it's the sum of the anti-derivatives.

29
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:09,082
And what's an anti-derivative for 8 times
something?

30
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:15,154
Well, that's a constant multiple, so it's
8 times the anti-derivative of t, plus an

31
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:19,849
anti-derivative for C.
Now, 8 times, what's an anti-derivative

32
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,955
for t?
Well one of them is t squared over 2.

33
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:28,054
And what's an anti-derivative for C?
Well, C times t is an anti-derivative for

34
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,570
C.
Then, I should add some constant here.

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,583
I'm going to call that constant big D.
Right.

36
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:36,774
So, here's my position.
I guess I could write this a little bit

37
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:40,870
more nicely, coz the 8 and the dividing by
2 simplify that I could write it as 4t

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,162
squared, plus Ct, plus D.
Well, that's kind of weird, right?

39
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:51,105
Why are there two constants in my answer?
Just knowing that my acceleration is 8

40
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:56,135
units per second squared, doesn't tell me
my initial velocity, right?

41
00:02:56,136 --> 00:03:01,185
This quantity C here, is really v of 0.
Right?

42
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:06,914
It's my initial velocity.
And I could be accelerating at a rate of 8

43
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:11,106
units per second squared.
But starting with any of a range of

44
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:15,926
possible initial velocities, right?
I could be going really fast at first or

45
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:19,820
really slow at first.
But still, always accelerating at 8 units

46
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,298
per second squared.
So, knowing this doesn't nail down C.

47
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:29,183
Similarly, just knowing my velocity
doesn't nail down my initial position.

48
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:32,741
Right?
This D here is really p of 0.

49
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,037
Right?
If I plug in t equals 0, I just get D.

50
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:41,911
And that means that D is really providing
my initial position.

51
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:48,827
So, if I know my initial position and my
initial velocity and my acceleration, then

52
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,550
I can nail down an exact formula for my
position.

53
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,526
I can get rid of these mystery constants.
The important lesson to take away here is

54
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:00,182
that anti-differentiating can actually be
useful.

55
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:05,295
Anti-differentiating let's us take, say,
velocity information and produce the

56
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:10,277
position data.
Or even better, in this case, it let us

57
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:19,548
take acceleration information, figure out
the velocity, and then, take that velocity

58
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,773
information to figure out my position.
