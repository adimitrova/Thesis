music maybe i dont know position 
velocity, i know acceleration 
maybe acceleration sometime is 
a constant units per second 
squared, right 
so, im going to accelerate a constant 
rate 
is that enough information to determine 
velocity 
we to think back to velocity 
acceleration related 
definition acceleration is 
change to derivative in velocity, 
right 
acceleration is rate change in 
velocity 
in words, right, velocity is an 
antiderivative acceleration 
so, i know that a is 
lets solve v 
okay, so a t, acceleration, is 
constant function , v is 
antiderivative acceleration, right 
if i antidifferentiate acceleration, im 
going to get velocity 
means im antidifferentiating 
well antidifferentiates to t, 
plus constant c 
that constant 
right 
knowing acceleration doesnt determine 
velocity, determines 
velocity to constant 
i could going really fast really 
slow, still accelerating 
rate 
well, in case, ive least got a 
formula velocity that 
constant 
now, i use that formula to determine 
position 
kind game 
velocity is rate in change in 
position, right 
velocity is derivative position 
that means position is an 
antiderivative velocity 
so, lets antidifferentiate 
so, p is an antiderivative 
velocity, i figured velocity a 
minute ago 
velocity is plus c 
so, i want to antidifferentiate plus 
c 
well, an antiderivative a sum, so 
sum antiderivatives 
whats an antiderivative times 
something 
well, thats a constant multiple, so 
times antiderivative t, plus an 
antiderivative c 
now, times, whats an antiderivative 

well one is squared 
whats an antiderivative c 
well, c times is an antiderivative 
c 
then, i add constant here 
im going to call that constant big d 
right 
so, heres position 
i guess i could write this a little bit 
nicely, coz dividing 
simplify that i could write 
squared, plus ct, plus d 
well, thats kind weird, right 
there two constants in answer 
knowing that acceleration is 
units per second squared, doesnt tell 
initial velocity, right 
this quantity c here, is really v 
right 
initial velocity 
i could accelerating a rate 
units per second squared 
starting a range 
possible initial velocities, right 
i could going really fast first 
really slow first 
still, always accelerating units 
per second squared 
so, knowing this doesnt nail c 
similarly, knowing velocity 
doesnt nail initial position 
right 
this d here is really p 
right 
if i plug in equals , i get d 
that means that d is really providing 
initial position 
so, if i know initial position 
initial velocity acceleration, 
i nail an exact formula 
position 
i get rid mystery constants 
important lesson to take away here is 
that antidifferentiating actually 
useful 
antidifferentiating lets us take, say, 
velocity information produce 
position data 
even better, in this case, let us 
take acceleration information, figure 
velocity, then, take that velocity 
information to figure position
