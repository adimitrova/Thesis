1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,952
[music] There's a visual way to gain some
insight into these anti-differentiation

2
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:14,019
problems.
A visual method goes by the name of slope

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,174
fields.
So, what's a slope field?

4
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:20,376
The idea is that I start with some
function.

5
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:23,954
Like, here's an example of function x
squared minus x.

6
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:29,414
But instead of just graphing the function,
like I normally do here, I'm graphing the

7
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:31,848
function's values.
I make a graph.

8
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:37,007
But the thing that I'm graphing is little
tiny line segments of that given slope,

9
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,594
right?
So, instead of plotting a value at some

10
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:45,264
height, I draw little tiny line segments
with that slope.

11
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:51,445
Now, you can see in this example that if
you plug in 0 or 1 into this function, the

12
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,812
output 0.
And in this slope field, if you look at a

13
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:03,138
point whose x value is 0 or whose x value
is 1, there I'm plotting just horizontal

14
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:08,317
lines, lines of slope zero.
Over here, I've got very high slope, and

15
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:13,336
over here I've got very high slope.
And that just reflects the fact that this

16
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:18,059
function's value is very high when x is
negative and when x is positive.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,879
And in between here, I've got just a
little tiny region where the lines are

18
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,780
pointing down, right?
Where the slope of these little line

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,420
segments is negative.
And of course, that's because there's a

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,805
little tiny region here where this
function's value is negative.

21
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:40,320
Well, let's look at a specific example.
With this specific example, function F of

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,141
x equals x times cosine x.
Now, I can draw the slope field for this

23
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:48,957
example.
Well, in that case, here's the slope field

24
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:54,780
that I get.
Imagine that I have an anti-derivative, a

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,621
function f, whose derivative was F.
That is, suppose I had some function, f,

26
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:03,018
whose derivative was F.
The slope field is drawn so that all these

27
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:08,760
little line segments have slope equal to
the value of F, so I could use this slope

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,624
field to try to draw a picture, the graph
of my function f, right?

29
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:16,150
Let's suppose that my function maybe
starts here.

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,222
And then, I could try to follow the slope
field along and try to use the information

31
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:29,774
in the, in the slope field to try to draw
a picture of what my function, f, must

32
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,910
look like.
So, these slope fields let you see the

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,721
anti-derivative, right?
If you follow the slope field, you're

34
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,847
tracing out a function whose derivative is
given by the slope field.

35
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:46,356
Now, we can find this anti-derivative, but
we're trying to anti-differentiate x

36
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:49,480
cosine x.
Well, our first guess might be x sine x.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,995
I mean, that's a reasonable guess because
differentiating sine will give me the

38
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:58,445
cosine and it, but what happens if I
actually differentiate this product?

39
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:04,127
Well, that's the sort of thing that I do
with the product rule which is x times the

40
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:07,626
derivative, which is cosine.
So, that's looking good.

41
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:14,042
But it's plus the derivative of the first,
which is 1 times the second, which is sine

42
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,585
x.
So, the anti-derivative of x cosine x

43
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:21,012
isn't just x sine x because I've got this
pesky additional sine x term.

44
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:25,141
But I also know that the derivative of
cosine is minus sine.

45
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:34,408
So, if I add these things together, right?
If I add them together, what's the

46
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:39,636
derivative of x sine x plus cosine x?
Well, it's these two things added

47
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:44,040
together.
But that's x cosine x, which is good, plus

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,892
sine x minus sine x.
So, it's just x cosine x.

49
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:53,750
So that means the general anti-derivative
of x cosine x is x sine x plus cosine x

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,695
plus some constant c.
And yeah, we can see this in the graph.

51
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,296
So here, I've graphed x sine x plus cosine
x.

52
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:05,387
And you can see that it's really moving in
the direction of the slope field, which

53
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:08,284
makes sense.
Because the slope field is coming from x

54
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:11,272
cosine x, which is the derivative of this
thing.

55
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:16,226
And, you know, I drew the slope field by
drawing little tiny line segments whose

56
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:20,282
slope is x cosine x.
So, since this thing differentiates to x

57
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:24,480
cosine x, this thing is really moving
along the slope field.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,088
The slope field picture also gives you
some insight into how the plus c really

59
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,366
works.
What is the plus c really accomplishing,

60
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:34,607
right?
It's moving the graph up and down.

61
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,828
And if you start with, you know, say x
sine x plus cosine x, and then you slide

62
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:44,702
that graph up and down, it's still
following the slope field, right?

63
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:50,194
It's still an anti-derivative for x cosine
x.

64
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:56,016
