music theres a visual way to gain 
insight antidifferentiation 
problems 
a visual method goes name slope 
fields 
so, whats a slope field 
idea is that i start 
function 
like, heres an example function x 
squared minus x 
instead graphing function, 
like i normally here, im graphing 
functions values 
i make a graph 
thing that im graphing is little 
tiny line segments that given slope, 
right 
so, instead plotting a value 
height, i draw little tiny line segments 
that slope 
now, you see in this example that if 
you plug in this function, 
output 
in this slope field, if you look a 
point whose x value is whose x value 
is , there im plotting horizontal 
lines, lines slope zero 
here, ive got high slope, 
here ive got high slope 
that reflects fact that this 
functions value is high x is 
negative x is positive 
in between here, ive got a 
little tiny region lines 
pointing down, right 
slope little line 
segments is negative 
course, thats theres a 
little tiny region here this 
functions value is negative 
well, lets look a specific example 
this specific example, function f 
x equals x times cosine x 
now, i draw slope field this 
example 
well, in that case, heres slope field 
that i get 
imagine that i an antiderivative, a 
function f, whose derivative f 
that is, suppose i function, f, 
whose derivative f 
slope field is drawn so that 
little line segments slope equal to 
value f, so i could use this slope 
field to try to draw a picture, graph 
function f, right 
lets suppose that function maybe 
starts here 
then, i could try to follow slope 
field along try to use information 
in the, in slope field to try to draw 
a picture function, f, must 
look like 
so, slope fields let you see 
antiderivative, right 
if you follow slope field, youre 
tracing a function whose derivative is 
given slope field 
now, we find this antiderivative, 
trying to antidifferentiate x 
cosine x 
well, first guess might x sine x 
i mean, thats a reasonable guess 
differentiating sine will give 
cosine it, happens if i 
actually differentiate this product 
well, thats sort thing that i 
product rule is x times 
derivative, is cosine 
so, thats looking good 
plus derivative first, 
is times second, is sine 
x 
so, antiderivative x cosine x 
isnt x sine x ive got this 
pesky additional sine x term 
i also know that derivative 
cosine is minus sine 
so, if i add things together, right 
if i add together, whats 
derivative x sine x plus cosine x 
well, two things added 
together 
thats x cosine x, is good, plus 
sine x minus sine x 
so, x cosine x 
so that means general antiderivative 
x cosine x is x sine x plus cosine x 
plus constant c 
yeah, we see this in graph 
so here, ive graphed x sine x plus cosine 
x 
you see that really moving in 
direction slope field, 
makes sense 
slope field is coming x 
cosine x, is derivative this 
thing 
and, you know, i drew slope field 
drawing little tiny line segments whose 
slope is x cosine x 
so, since this thing differentiates to x 
cosine x, this thing is really moving 
along slope field 
slope field picture also gives you 
insight plus c really 
works 
is plus c really accomplishing, 
right 
moving graph 
if you start with, you know, say x 
sine x plus cosine x, you slide 
that graph down, still 
following slope field, right 
still an antiderivative x cosine 
x
