music that weve learned so 
far, super easy to differentiate sine 
squared x, so im going to differentiate 
sine squared 
well, chain rule, right 
derivative outside 
function, is squaring function 
so, times inside function, 
is sine x, times derivative 
inside, is cosine x 
so there, thats derivative sine 
squared x 
if i wanted to go backwards 
if i wanted to antidifferentiate 
sine squared x 
i want to antidifferentiate sine squared 
x 
im looking a function whose 
derivative is sine squared x 
well, first guess central 
function might sine cubed 
if i differentiate this while im 
differentiating outside function, 
is cubing, so times 
inside function squared divided , 
thats looking good 
there, ive got a sine squared x 
problem is that, ive got to 
multiply this derivative 
inside function, is sine, 
derivative sine is cosine 
so, derivative this is sine 
squared x, sine squared x times this 
extra cosine 
oh, seems really hard 
well, theres a socalled half angle 
identity 
this is trick 
that sine squared x is, according to half 
angle identity, minus cosine x 

well, thats true 
that identity help 
well, since sine squared x is minus 
cosine x , that means 
antiderivative sine squared x is 
equal to antiderivative minus 
cosine x 
to this, this is 
antiderivative half times something 
so, i pull that factor half 
figure to 
antidifferentiate minus cosine x 
now, this is an antiderivative a 
difference, is difference 
antiderivatives 
so, i want to antidifferentiate i 
want to antidifferentiate cosine x 
now, whats an antiderivative 
well, x 
whats an antiderivative cosine 
x 
well, one antiderivative is sine 
x 
then, ive got to divide to 
compensate chain rule here 
itll add plus c 
so, there we go 
i could simplify this a little bit 
i could write this x minus sine 
x plus c, there is general 
antiderivative sine x 
maybe you really like this sort thing 
well, if you really fun 
this kind thing, heres a little 
challenge that you play 
you try to find an antiderivative 
say, sine to th, right 
if you dont like number , you 
make number, right 
pretty fun 
then, you try to apply 
trig identities to replace sine to 
power things that you currently 
antidifferentiate 
honestly pretty cool that 
antidifferentiation problems actually 
doable, that we write 
antiderivatives
