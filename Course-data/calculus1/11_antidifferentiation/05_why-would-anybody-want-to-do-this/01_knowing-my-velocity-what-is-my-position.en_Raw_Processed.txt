lets suppose that i a formula 
velocity 
instance i made velocity time 
is something like minus times 
that equation in hand, i 
determine position 
right 
velocity position related in 
way 
derivative position is, well 
lets, lets write that fact 
p is position time 
v is velocity time 
crucial thing here is if 
derivative position, right 
rate change position is 
velocity 
so, derivative p is v 
so, ive written that a derivative 
statement i could also write an 
antiderivative statement 
so, i write that p is an 
antiderivative v t, right 
p differentiates to v, 
antiderivative v is p 
now, i want to use fact that 
velocity time is minus 
that means in specific case that 
position, antiderivative 
velocity velocity is minus t, 
right 
so, position is antiderivative 
velocity 
we solve that antidifferentiation 
problem 
well, here we go 
alright 
this is antiderivative a 
difference, is difference 
antiderivatives 
now, id like to antidifferentiate , 
would antiderivative a constant 
that constant times 
whats an antiderivative times 

well, thats times an antiderivative 

so, i got minus times 
whats an antiderivative 
power rule, an antiderivative 
is squared 
if i differentiate this, i get back 
im going to include a plus c here 
so i rewrite this minus 
squared plus constant c 
now, that plus c a perfectly 
reasonable physical interpretation 
if i know velocity, i know position 
long i know initial position, 
long i know i started, right 
thats that plus c is encoding 
if i knew instance that position 
times say units, i could 
figure c would to right 
that would tell position 
time t, minus squared plus 
this is an example knowing 
initial position, position time , 
knowing velocity time, is 
enough to figure position 
in fancy terms, this is an example 
solving a differential equation 
i started derivative information, 
antidifferentiating, i recovered 
original function, to a constant
