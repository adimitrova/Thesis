music sometimes people ask anti 
derivative 
instead talking anti 
derivative probably better to talk 
an anti deriviative 
so is this an distinction 
really important 
a function one 
antiderivative 
lets take a look an example 
lets think function f x 
equals x, to find whole real 
line 
you think a function whose 
derivative is x 
im looking a function 
differentiates to give this function 
so heres an example 
a big f x equals x squared, yes, if 
i differentiate that function i get back 
x, is in fact little f 
so derivative big f is little f, 
in words an antiderivative 
little f 
is big f 
okay 
good 
now, we think another function 
whose derivative is x 
well, yeah 
think this function big g x 
ill define to x squared plus 
big gs derivative is derivative 
this sum is derivative x 
squared is x plus derivative 
is 
so big g differentiates to little f 
that means another antiderivative 
little f is big g 
okay great 
lets think yet another function 
whose derivative is x 
yeah, i play this game day 
big h x is equal to say x squared plus 
big h differentiates to x 
so big h is another anti derivative 
little f 
theres clearly a pattern here, right 
whats general story 
well heres general story 
so i got this function f x equals x 
anti derivative little f 
form big f 
equals x squared plus c constant 
c 
previous examples this 
form 
like here constant is , here 
constant is , here constant is 
im claiming here is that 
anti derivative is x squared 
plus fixed number 
we know this 
well, goes back to mean value 
theorem 
so, suppose ive got antiderivatives, 
big f big g little f 
in words, i mean that if i 
differentiate big f i get little f, if 
i differentiate big g i get little f 
so, suppose ive got two anti derivatives 
little f 
i do, like i define a new 
function called big h big h will 
big f minus big g 
i know derivative 
big h, derivative big h is 
derivative f minus derivative g 
derivative difference 
is difference derivatives 
so this is derivative f minus 
derivative g 
is derivative f 
little f 
whats derivative g 
little f 
this is little f minus little f 
oh noes 
this is , right 
derivative big h is 
that mean 
well if you think back to mean value 
theorem earlier in course, if a 
functions derivative is equal to zero, 
say that function is defined whole 
real line, like example x squared 
two x, then, that means that this 
function is a constant 
right 
so that means that h x is a constant 
now, that means is that 
difference between f g, two 
antiderivatives little f, is 
fixed constant, right 
in words, f x, is equal to g x 
plus constant 
this is exactly trying to 
get at, right 
this idea that if a functions got two 
different antiderivatives 
functions defined say 
whole real line 
two different antiderivatives 
differ a constant said 
differently 
if youve got a specific antiderivative, 
antiderivative is 
that specific antiderivative plus 
constant 
let say that again, and, actually 
write 
suppose that little f is a function thats 
defined an interval i 
thats really crucial that defined 
an interval 
suppose that big f is an 
antiderivative little f 
in words if i differentiate big f, i 
get little f 
well antiderivative little f, 
this one, antiderivative 
form big f x plus c 
constant c
