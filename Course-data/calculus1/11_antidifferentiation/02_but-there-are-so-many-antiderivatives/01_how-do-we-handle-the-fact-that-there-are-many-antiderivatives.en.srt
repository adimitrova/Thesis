1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,272
[music] Sometimes people ask for the anti
derivative.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:14,722
But instead of talking about the anti
derivative it's probably better to talk

3
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:20,942
about an anti deriviative.
So why is this the and an distinction

4
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:25,984
really important.
Because a function can have more than one

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,125
anti-derivative.
Let's take a look at an example.

6
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:36,256
Let's think about the function f of x
equals 2 x, to find on the whole real

7
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:39,347
line.
Can you think of a function whose

8
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:42,898
derivative is 2 x?
I'm looking for a function which

9
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:46,820
differentiates to give me this function.
So here's an example.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,882
A big f of x equals x squared, and yes, if
I differentiate that function I get back

11
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:59,067
2x, which is in fact little f.
So the derivative of big f is little f, or

12
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,544
in other words an anti-derivative for
little f.

13
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,368
Is big F.
Okay.

14
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:06,421
Good.
Now, can we think of another function

15
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,600
whose derivative is 2x?
Well, yeah.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,785
Think about this function big G of x which
I'll define to be x squared plus 17 and

17
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:20,770
big G's derivative is the derivative of
this sum which is the derivative of x

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,168
squared which is 2x plus the derivative of
17 which is 0.

19
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:32,425
So big G differentiates to little f.
And that means another anti-derivative for

20
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,280
little f is big G.
Okay great.

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,545
Now let's think of yet another function
whose derivative is 2x.

22
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:44,724
Yeah, I can play this game all day.
Big H of x is equal to say x squared plus

23
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:49,120
123.
Big h differentiates to 2 x again.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,847
So big h is another anti derivative of
little f.

25
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:56,527
There's clearly a pattern here, right.
What's the general story?

26
00:01:56,528 --> 00:02:01,154
Well here's the general story.
So I got this function f of x equals 2 x.

27
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:05,380
Any anti derivative of little f has the
form big f.

28
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:09,656
Equals x squared plus c for some constant
c.

29
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,912
All of out previous examples had this
form.

30
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:19,248
Like here the constant is 0, here the
constant is 17, here the constant is 123.

31
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:24,624
And what I'm claiming here is that any
other anti derivative is just x squared

32
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:27,910
plus some fixed number.
How do we know this?

33
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,778
Well, it goes back to the mean value
theorem.

34
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:38,327
So, suppose I've got 2 anti-derivatives,
big F and big G for little f.

35
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:44,476
In other words, I mean that if I
differentiate big F I get little f, and if

36
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:50,713
I differentiate big G I get little f.
So, suppose I've got Two anti derivatives

37
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:55,410
for little F.
Now what can I do, like I define a new

38
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,730
function called big H and big H will just
be big F minus big G.

39
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,955
Now what do I know about the derivative of
big H, the derivative of big H is the

40
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:10,440
derivative of F minus the derivative of G
because the derivative of the difference

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,286
is the difference of derivatives.
So this is the derivative of f minus the

42
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:19,200
derivative of g.
But what is the derivative of f?

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,230
It's little f.
What's the derivative of g?

44
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,927
It's little f?
This is little f minus little f.

45
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:28,883
Oh noes.
This is 0, right?

46
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:32,050
The derivative of big H is 0.
Now what does that mean?

47
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,782
Well if you think back to the mean value
theorem From earlier in the course, if a

48
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:46,009
functions derivative is equal to zero, and
say that function is defined on the whole

49
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:52,741
real line, like our example with x squared
and two x, then, that means that this

50
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,459
function is a constant.
Right?

51
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:03,360
So that means that h of x Is a constant.
Now, what that means is that the

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,591
difference between F and G, these two
antiderivatives for little f, is just some

53
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:16,851
fixed constant, right?
In other words, F of x, is equal to G of x

54
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:23,692
plus some constant.
And this is exactly what we're trying to

55
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:27,728
get at, right?
This idea that if a function's got two

56
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:32,040
different anti-derivatives.
And the function's defined say on the

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,572
whole real line.
Then those two different anti-derivatives

58
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:39,557
just differ by a constant or said
differently.

59
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:44,883
If you've got a specific anti-derivative,
than any other anti-derivative is just

60
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:48,340
that specific anti-derivative plus some
constant.

61
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,734
Let me say that again, and, and actually
write it down.

62
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:54,870
Suppose that little f is a function that's
defined on an interval I.

63
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,837
That's really crucial that it's defined on
an interval.

64
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:01,747
And suppose that big F is an
anti-derivative of little f.

65
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,558
In other words if I differentiate big F, I
get little f.

66
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:14,308
Well then any antiderivative of little f,
not just this one, any antiderivative has

67
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:18,820
the form big F of x plus c for some
constant c.
