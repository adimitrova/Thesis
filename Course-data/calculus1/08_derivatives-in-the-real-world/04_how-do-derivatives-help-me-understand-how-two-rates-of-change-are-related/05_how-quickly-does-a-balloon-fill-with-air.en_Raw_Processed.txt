im going to blow this balloon 
lets suppose that im blowing air 
that balloon a constant rate, so 
balloons volume is changing a constant 
rate 
quickly is radius balloon 
changing 
we model balloon a sphere 
recall volume a sphere in terms 
radius r 
volume a sphere radius r is 
rds pi r cubed 
so fast radius change i 
blow balloon 
so ive got original equation 
volume a sphere radius r 
im going to differentiate sides 
respect to time 
so derivative v, respect to 
time, is im going to write dv dt 
derivative side, 
respect to time, weve gotta think a 
little bit 
rds pi constants 
so i pull derivative 
ive still gotta figure 
time derivative r cubed is 
to figure time derivative r 
cubed, im regarding r, remember, a 
function 
so i use chain rule, 
derivative cubing is times inside 
function squared times derivative 
inside function, so dr dt 
so dv dt is rds pi times times r 
squared times dr dt 
lets solve dr dt, rate change 
in balloons radius 
right, so im going to solve dr 
dt 
well, first thing i is, ive got a 
dividing , a multiplying 
so i dont need to 
operations 
so this is pi r squared times dr dt 
side is dv dt 
so ill divide sides pi r 
squared 
ill find that, dr dt is dv dt 
divided pi r squared 
we really make use this equation 
i, this help us 
yeah, this makes sense 
we started original equation 
volume a sphere in terms 
radius 
i differentitated this equation 
solved dr dt 
this equation is telling is 
that change in radius, is 
dr dt is measuring, rate change in 
size balloon, well, depends 
quickly volumes changing, 
is dv dt 
also depends upon radius, 
right 
this is this r squared in denominator 
in particular, a really big balloon 
doesnt get a whole lot bigger a given 
change in volume, compared to a little 
tiny balloon, gets quite a bit 
bigger change in volume 
to that r squared in 
denominator 
balloons radius is small, a 
given change in volume results in quite a 
dramatic change in radius 
radius is large, r 
squared in denominator means that dr 
dt is much smaller 
change in volume 
another breath, yeah, i mean, 
things still getting bigger, much 
less dramatically
