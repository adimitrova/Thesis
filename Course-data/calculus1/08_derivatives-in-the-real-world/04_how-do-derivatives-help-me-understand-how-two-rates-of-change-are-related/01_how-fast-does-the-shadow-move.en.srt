1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,290
[music] Here is a classic related rates
problem.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,722
So here's the question.
You're walking away from a light source,

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:18,012
at some speed, and you don't know how fast
is your shadow's length changing.

4
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:23,030
There's a standard method to solving a
related rates problem, four steps.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,395
So, step 1 is draw a picture, alright?
You're told some sort of story, you should

6
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,710
convert it into some diagram.
Step 2, find an equation.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,010
Given that picture, you should label
everything in the picture so you can write

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,372
down some equation.
Step 3 is to differentiate that equation

9
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,633
which would probably involve the chain
rule.

10
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,766
And step 4 is to solve that equation for
whatever you're interested in finding out.

11
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,710
I mean, hopefully you're trying to find
some rate of something so, you're going to

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,021
try to find one of these derivatives in
there.

13
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:55,969
Let's draw a picture to represent this
person moving away from the light source.

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,350
Here's my picture, I've got a light source
right here and I've got this person right

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,876
here.
And I imagine that person walking away

16
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,507
from the light and I've drawn in their
shadow.

17
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:10,037
And I've drawn this beam of light just
glancing across this person's head.

18
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:15,070
Now we'll turn this picture into an
equation using similar triangles.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,472
You might suppose that the original
problem told us that the lamppost was 3

20
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:22,760
meters tall, and the person was, say, two
meters tall.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,250
And I can label the other relevant lengths
on this diagram.

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,079
I'll call x the distance from the bottom
of the lamppost to the person's feet, and

23
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,760
the distance from the feet to the tip of
the shadow, I'll call that s for shadow.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,186
So, now I've got a nicely labeled diagram,
and I can replace that nicely labeled

25
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:46,139
diagram with a slightly more extract
diagram, where the person is now a

26
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,025
vertical line, the lamppost is now a
vertical line, and I've got these

27
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,967
triangles.
The up shot here is that I've got similar

28
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,833
triangles.
This little triangle is similiar to this

29
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,917
big triangle.
Well, because the angles are all the same,

30
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,665
right?
Both of these triangles have a right angle

31
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,960
here, they have the same angle here,
consequently these angles are the same.

32
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:10,667
They're two triangles that have the same
angles, they're similar triangles.

33
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:14,854
And as a result, I get this equation out
of the diagram.

34
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:19,600
This distance to this distance, x plus s
to 3, must be the same as the

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,592
corresponding ratio in to the other
triangle, which is this distance to this

36
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:28,354
distance s over 2.
With an equation in hand we can now

37
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:34,561
differentiate.
Thinking of my position and the shadow's

38
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:43,073
length as a function of t, I could rewrite
this equation as say, x of t plus s of t

39
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:48,134
divided by 3 equals s of t divided by 2,
right?

40
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:52,298
My position is a function of time and my
show's length is a function of time, and I

41
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,904
can differentiate both sides of this
equation.

42
00:02:54,904 --> 00:03:03,224
The derivative of this is 1 3rd, the
derivative of x plus the derivative of s,

43
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:10,690
and the derivative of the other side is
one half the derivative of s.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,590
And I could solve for the derivative of s.
Let me first expand this out.

45
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:26,215
I've got 1/3 derivative of x plus 1/3
derivative of s, is 1/2 derivative of s.

46
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:37,596
I'll subtract 1/3 s prime from both sides.
Got 1 3rd x prime is 1 6th s prime.

47
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:42,633
'Because a half minus a 3rd is a 6th.
And then I multiply both sides by 6.

48
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:49,128
So I find out that s prime.
This is the rate of change in the shadow's

49
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:54,280
length is twice.
X prime this is the speed for which the

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,454
person is moving.
There's a bit of a surprise to this

51
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,280
answer.
Take a look at this equation, It's telling

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,260
you that the speed that your shadows
length is changing is just twice the speed

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,090
that your walking.
But it doesnt matter where your standing.

54
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,042
The value of x doesn't appear on this side
only x prime appears on this side.

55
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,913
So that's kind of interesting right?
The speed with which your shadow is

56
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:24,250
growing only has to do with how fast
you're walking.

57
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,345
In fact, the speed at which your shadow is
growing is exactly twice the speed at

58
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,842
which you are walking.
Assuming of course, you are two meters

59
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:34,839
tall and the lamp post is three meters
tall.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,022
I think the important thing to take away
from this example is that similar

61
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:43,557
triangles are hugely helpful.
If you see similar triangles, use them.

62
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:47,054
There's also one thing that I think is
very funny about this particular solution

63
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,414
to the problem.
Here's the challenge for you to think

64
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,896
about.
If your velocity is 90% the speed of

65
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:54,988
light, so you're almost going the speed of
light.

66
00:04:54,988 --> 00:05:04,435
Then this formula would be telling you
that your shadow's length would be moving

67
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:11,073
faster than the speed of light, is that
really possible?
