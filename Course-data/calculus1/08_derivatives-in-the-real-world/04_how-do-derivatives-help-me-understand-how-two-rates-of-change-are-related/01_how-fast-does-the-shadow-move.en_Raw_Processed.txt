music here is a classic related rates 
problem 
so heres question 
youre walking away a light source, 
speed, you dont know fast 
is shadows length changing 
theres a standard method to solving a 
related rates problem, four steps 
so, step is draw a picture, alright 
youre told sort story, you 
convert diagram 
step , find an equation 
given that picture, you label 
everything in picture so you write 
equation 
step is to differentiate that equation 
would probably involve chain 
rule 
step is to solve that equation 
whatever youre interested in finding 
i mean, hopefully youre trying to find 
rate something so, youre going to 
try to find one derivatives in 
there 
lets draw a picture to represent this 
person moving away light source 
heres picture, ive got a light source 
right here ive got this person right 
here 
i imagine that person walking away 
light ive drawn in 
shadow 
ive drawn this beam light 
glancing across this persons head 
well turn this picture an 
equation using similar triangles 
you might suppose that original 
problem told us that lamppost 
meters tall, person was, say, two 
meters tall 
i label relevant lengths 
this diagram 
ill call x distance bottom 
lamppost to persons feet, 
distance feet to tip 
shadow, ill call that shadow 
so, ive got a nicely labeled diagram, 
i replace that nicely labeled 
diagram a slightly extract 
diagram, person is a 
vertical line, lamppost is a 
vertical line, ive got 
triangles 
shot here is that ive got similar 
triangles 
this little triangle is similiar to this 
big triangle 
well, angles same, 
right 
triangles a right angle 
here, angle here, 
consequently angles 
theyre two triangles that 
angles, theyre similar triangles 
a result, i get this equation 
diagram 
this distance to this distance, x plus 
to , must 
corresponding ratio in to 
triangle, is this distance to this 
distance 
an equation in hand we 
differentiate 
thinking position shadows 
length a function t, i could rewrite 
this equation say, x plus 
divided equals divided , 
right 
position is a function time 
shows length is a function time, i 
differentiate sides this 
equation 
derivative this is rd, 
derivative x plus derivative s, 
derivative side is 
one half derivative 
i could solve derivative 
let first expand this 
ive got derivative x plus 
derivative s, is derivative 
ill subtract prime sides 
got rd x prime is th prime 
a half minus a rd is a th 
i multiply sides 
so i find that prime 
this is rate change in shadows 
length is twice 
x prime this is speed 
person is moving 
theres a bit a surprise to this 
answer 
take a look this equation, telling 
you that speed that shadows 
length is changing is twice speed 
that walking 
doesnt matter standing 
value x doesnt appear this side 
x prime appears this side 
so thats kind interesting right 
speed shadow is 
growing to fast 
youre walking 
in fact, speed shadow is 
growing is exactly twice speed 
you walking 
assuming course, you two meters 
tall lamp post is three meters 
tall 
i think important thing to take away 
this example is that similar 
triangles hugely helpful 
if you see similar triangles, use 
theres also one thing that i think is 
funny this particular solution 
to problem 
heres challenge you to think 

if velocity is speed 
light, so youre almost going speed 
light 
this formula would telling you 
that shadows length would moving 
faster speed light, is that 
really possible
