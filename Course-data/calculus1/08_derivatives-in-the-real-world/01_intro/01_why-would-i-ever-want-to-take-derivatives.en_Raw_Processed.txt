music 
now, we in this course 
well, a long, long time ago, we 
looking limits, right 
we first studied the, concept 

limit, we learned to compute 
limits 
went application limits, 

limits difference quotients, 
derivative 
we studied concepts 
derivative 
is derivative telling us a 
function 
weve studying a turn 
techniques computing derivatives 
we learned product rule, 
quotient rule, chain rule 
derivatives special functions like 
e to x, log x, sines cosines 
that leave us 
weve studied concepts weve studied 
computations 
going to study applications 
would anyone care derivatives in 
first place 
right, whats real world pay 
theres a couple applications i want to 
look 
one applications is back to 
limits 
if you want to calculate limits 
turns out, sometimes you use 
derivatives to calculate limits 
thats story lopitals rule 
second application this week is 
much exciting 
related rates 
time in real world, youve got 
equations between different quantities 
maybe you know one 
quantities is changing, well, if you start 
that equation you differentiate 
it, that 
gives you relationship between 
rates, right 
derivative that equation will tell 
you ones things 
rate change is related to something 
elses rate change 
translating sort story problems, 
sort real world scenarios 
equations, differentiating 
equations 
we learn, relationships 
between different rates change 
thats story related rates 
going to a turn examples 
those, right
