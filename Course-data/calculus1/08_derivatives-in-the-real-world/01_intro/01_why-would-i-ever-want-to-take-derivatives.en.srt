2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,692
Now, where are we in this course?

3
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:11,350
Well, a long, long time ago, we were
looking at limits, right?

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,800
And we first studied the, the concept of
the

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,210
limit, and we learned how to compute with
limits.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,580
And then went into application of limits,
which

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,900
was limits of difference quotients, which
was the derivative.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,617
And we studied some of the concepts of the
derivative.

9
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,237
What is the derivative telling us about a
function?

10
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:31,200
And then we've been studying a turn of
techniques for computing derivatives.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,670
And we learned about the product rule, the
quotient rule, the chain rule.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,709
Derivatives of some special functions like
e to the x, log x, sines and cosines.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,970
Where does that leave us?

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,750
We've studied the concepts we've studied
some of the computations.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,120
Now we're going to study applications.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,790
Why would anyone care about derivatives in
the first place?

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,330
Right, what's the real world pay off?

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,440
There's a couple applications I want to
look at now.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,150
One of those applications is just back to
limits.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,950
If you want to calculate limits.

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,020
Turns out, sometimes you can use
derivatives to calculate limits.

22
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,920
That's the story of lopital's rule.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,980
But the second application this week is
much more exciting.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,290
It's related rates.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,920
All the time in the real world, you've got
equations between different quantities.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,890
And maybe you know how one of those
quantities is changing, well, if you start

27
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,520
with that equation and you differentiate
it, that

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,590
gives you some relationship between the
rates, right?

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,440
The derivative of that equation will tell
you how one's things

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,830
rate of change is related to something
else's rate of change.

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,040
And by translating sort of story problems,
sort of real world scenarios.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
Into equations, and then differentiating
those equations.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,470
We can learn, about the relationships
between these different rates of change.

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,795
That's the story of related rates.

35
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:54,720
We're going to do a turn of the examples
of those, right now
