music we already know to calculate 
limits that a small number 
divided a small number a zero 
zero form 
so weve seen unknown patels rule 
situation limit numerator 
limit denominator zero, 
turns thatinaudible rule is also 
valid limit numerator 
limit denominator 
infinity 
i mean you still got 
conditions 
you gotta check that limit 
ratio derivative exists, 
derivative denominator is zero 
values x near a 
given conditions, you get 
fantastic conclusion 
that limit f g is limit 
derivative f derivative 
g 
lets take a look an example 
well, heres an example 
this is an example, you really dont need 
to useunknown a lot, least 
demonstrates technique is 
limit numerator is infinity, 
limit ofthe denominator is also 
infinity, though thats maybe a little bit 
harder to see 
consequently we could use lopatolg, 
would tell us to compute instead 
derivative numerator 
is x plus , divided 
derivative denominator, is x 
minus 
i calculate limit this x 
approaches infinity 
yes, course i could this 
directly i could use 
lowbatal i really wanted to 
limit numerator is infinity, 
limit denominator is infinity 
so lobatall tells to instead consider 
ratio derivatives, derivative 
numerator is , derivative 
denominator is 
im in a situation im 
taking limit a constant a 
constant 
that means that limit is th, 
tells to compute original 
limit, but, this isnt best way to 
this problem, least 
demonstrates that you could use lopital in 
a situation you got infinity 
infinity 
infinity 
every limit is something going to 
zero something going to zero, 
something going to infinity something 
going to infinity 
sometimes you might a limit 
a product, first term is heading 
towards zero second term is 
heading towards infinity 
example, here im asking 
limit x approaches infinity sin 
one x times x 
this first term, sine x, thats 
getting close to x is large 
second term, x, that is 
getting big 
so this first term is a tendency to 
made this quantity smaller second 
term is a tendency to make 
quantity bigger 
you know, wins 
well lobitolg thing that we 
really deal is sort a 
situation an infinity infinity 
situation thats neither 
we transform this problem one 
situations 
so instead calculating this limit ill 
calculate equivalent problem, 
limit x approaches infinity 
sine x in numerator divided 
x 
so instead multiplying something 
is going towards infinity, im going 
to divide reciprocal 
reciprocal something going to 
infinity, is going to 
so ive got a situation 
numerator is going to , 
denominator is going to , this 
problem, equivalent to original 
problem 
is amenable to lhospitals rule 
so lhospitals rule i would want to 
differentiate numerator, differentiate 
denominator look that 
limit to try to understand this original 
limit 
well, whats derivative of, sine 
x, cosine x, 
derivative sine is cosine, times 
derivative inside, is 
minus x squared 
im going to divide 
derivitative denominator, is 
minus x squared 
so, i evaluate this limit 
well, good news is that ive got a 
minus x squared in numerator 
a minus x squared in 
denominator 
so this limit is limit 
x approaches infinity cosine 
x 
now, x is getting close to 
whats cosine a number close to 

so this original limit, is 
you might something near , 
raised to a high power 
heres an example 
limit x approaches infinity, 
plus x, raised to xth power 
so large values x, base 
here, plus x, thats close to , 
exponent is large 
if you take a number close to raise 
to a 
high power actually unclear 
youre going to get 
depending to quickly this is moving 
towards quickly this thing is 
growing 
you get wildly different answers 
this is infinity 
infinity 
so ive got to transform this problem 
something 
thing that lhopital handle 
trick here is to use exponential 
functions 
so im going to rewrite this e to 
log limit x approaches infinity 
plus x to xth power 
e to log something nothing, 
ritght 
inverse functions 
but, log a limit is limit 
log 
so this is 
e to limit x approaches infinity 
log plus x to xth 
power 
log something to a power is that 
power times log, so this is e 
to limit x approaches infinity x 
times log one plus one x 
kind situation i in here 
x is large log a number close 
to one is close to zero 
this is big number times number close to 
zero 
thats infinity times zero 
indeterminate form, so i going to 
handle this 
we saw a minute ago that im going to 
handle this 
putting infinity in denominator 
reciprocals to make this 
, sort thing thatinaudible 
handle 
so this is e to limit x approaches 
infinity lg plus x divided 
x 
this is this, ive got 
something approaching divided 
something approaching 
this is sort situation 
thatinaudible help 
this is e to limit, lopital 
derivative numerator divided 
derivative denominator 
derivative log is one 
inside function, times derivative 
inside, is minus one x 
squared 
divided whats derivative 
x, well thing here minus 
x squared this is limit x 
approaches infinity 
ive got a minus x squared 
cancels minus x 
squared in denominator 
ive got plus x x 
approaches infinity 
this is getting close to one 
so this is e to st power, is e 
that means that this original limit, 
limit plus x to x 
power x approaches infinity, is equal 
to e 
you might a large number, 
raised to a small power 
example, lets say i want to come 
limit x approaches infinity 
x to xth power 
so base here is large, 
a tendency to make this number big, 
exponent is getting close to , 
would a tendency to pull this 
back closer to 
so is this 
well we try to transform this 
sort limit problem thatunknown 
handle, i that 
exponential functions 
so i rewrite this e to log 
limit x to xth power 
this is limit x approaches 
infinity 
now, this is log a limit 
is limit log x to 
xth power 
this is limit x approaches 
infinity 
log something to a power is 
that power 
so x times 
log base x approaches 
infinity 
ive got x, is number 
close to zero 
times log x, is a large 
number 
this is zero times infinity, so to speak 
so i try to transform this 
indeterminate form something that 
labetalol handle 
well, well write this a e to limit 
x approaching infinity, say log x 
x 
this is infinity infinity, so to 
speak 
thats sort thing that lhopitals 
okay with, so instead taking this 
limit 
i could look ratio 
derivatives 
derivative log x is x 
derivative x is 
so i look limit x 
x approaches infinity 
well, that limit is e to is , 
so limit x to x x 
approaches infinity is equal to 
you might a limit that looks like 
something going to infinity minus 
something going to infinity 
so lets try to compute limit x 
approaches infinity square root 
x squared plus x minus x 
so this is a large number minus a 
large 
infinity minus infinity situation 
so we try to factor this rewrite 
this to get a zero zero 
infinity infinity 
sort thing i could apply lopitolg 
to 
so i could try to pull an x this, 
x is going to infinity 
i know x is a large positive number here 
so i could rewrite this x times, so 
if i pull an x here 
thats square root plus x 
minus, i pull an extra one here i 
get minus 
so really, this limit, large values 
x, so x approaches infinity, is 
x times this quantity, square 
root plus x minus 
this is a large number 
i know this number 
well this is square root plus 
reciprocal a large number 
this is close to minus 
this second term is close to zero 
this is infinity times in determinate 
form 
so i could rewrite this using standard 
trick plus x minus 
so this is numerator 
this things going to divided 
x 
reciprocal this 
im dividing it, thats 
multiplying 
so ive got divided a number 
close to 
i, in determinate form 
so lopital tells i analyze this 
looking ratio the, 
derivatives, so i look limit 
x approaches infinity of, whats 
derivative this 
well, derivative square root is 
one two square root inside 
function, one plus one x, times 
derivative inside function 
so derivative x 
i dont to worry minus 
, derivitive thats 
i divide derivitave 
denominator, so ill write derivative 
x 
so ive got derivative x in 
numerator, derivative x in 
denominator 
this limit then, 
limit this 
so i looking limit x 
approaches infinity square 
root 
one plus one x 
well, whats one plus x x 
approaches infinity, thats one 
so this is one two square root a 
number close to one, this is one half 
and, indeed, this original limit really is 
one half 
i mean, honestly, we didnt need lhopital 
to calculate that, we could use 
lhopital if we wanted to 
to evaluate this limit 
okay, okay 
lets summarize possibilities 
so heres this summary everything you 
might see in theinaudible 
if you see zero zero, infinity 
infinity in a limit problem 
you apply lhopital, in that 
case 
here, ive lifted 
things that you might see 
in equations, theres 
nonsense equations, right 
i hope kind tell you you 

so if you see, say times infinity in a 
limit, that i mean, a product 
things, one is limit , 
limit infinity 
well, you transform this one 
cases so you apply lhopital 
so you could that moving 
denominator, taking reciprocal 
this is really infinity infinity 
or, you could move infinity in 
denominator, take reciprocal 
youve got 
if you see to a large power, 
something close to to a large power, 
right 
you use either log to transform 
this 
e to log this is e to large 
number times log number close to 
log a number close to is close to 
zero 
this is an infinity times indeterminate 
form 
you know to handle 
you convert back 
cases 
you useinaudible 
if you see infinity to 
well, you could use e to log 
trick 
exponent here is times log 
a big number 
a number close to times log a big 
number 
this is times infinity 
indeterminate form, is right here 
we transform you to cases, 
you use lhopital 
if you see to , i mean, a 
number close to raised to a power close 
to , you use e to log 
trick this is e to a number close to 
, times log a number close to 
whats log a small number 
thats negative 
so, this exponent is, again, times 
infinity in determinate form, you 
convert this apply 
lhopital to 
last case is this infinity minus 
infinity case, there, one thing you 
could try to is put common 
denominator, so im thinking common 
denominator here 
product two terms, here ive 
got second term minus 
first term 
point here is that you rewrite 
this difference large quantities 
a something getting close to divided 
something getting close to 
is sort thing that you could 
apply lhopital
