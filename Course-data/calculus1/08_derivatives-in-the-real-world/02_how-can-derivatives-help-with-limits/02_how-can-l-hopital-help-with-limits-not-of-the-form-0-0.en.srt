1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,501
[music] We already know how to calculate
limits that are a very small number

2
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:10,938
divided by a very small number a zero over
zero form.

3
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:16,572
So we've seen [unknown] Patel's rule for
the situation when limit the numerator

4
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:22,452
limit of the denominator of both zero, but
it turns out that[INAUDIBLE] rule is also

5
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:27,912
valid when the limit of the numerator and
the limit of the denominator are both

6
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:30,705
infinity.
I mean you still got all the other

7
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,526
conditions.
You gotta check that the limit of the

8
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:38,184
ratio of the derivative exists, the
derivative of the denominator is not zero.

9
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,725
For values of x near a.
But given these conditions, you then get

10
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:47,765
the same fantastic conclusion.
That the limit of f over g is the limit of

11
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,994
the derivative of f over the derivative of
g.

12
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:53,847
Let's take a look at an example.
Well, here's an example.

13
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:57,688
This is an example, you really don't need
to use[UNKNOWN] a lot, but at least it

14
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:01,480
demonstrates what the technique is.
The limit on the numerator is infinity,

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,308
the limit ofthe denominator is also
infinity, though that's maybe a little bit

16
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,039
harder to see.
And consequently We could use lopatol/g,

17
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,958
and it would tell us to compute instead
the derivative the numerator.

18
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:19,515
Which is 4 x plus 0, divided by the
derivative the denominator, which is 6 x

19
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:22,447
minus 1.
Now can I calculate the limit of this as x

20
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:25,515
approaches infinity.
Yes, of course I could just do this

21
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:29,102
directly too but I could again use
lowbatal of I really wanted to.

22
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:33,312
The limit of the numerator is infinity,
the limit of denominator is infinity.

23
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:37,734
So lobatall tells me to instead consider
the ratio of derivatives, the derivative

24
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:41,214
of the numerator is 4, the derivative of
the denominator is 6.

25
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:45,311
And now I'm in a situation where I'm just
taking the limit of a constant over a

26
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,063
constant.
That means that limit is 4 6th, which then

27
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:52,095
tells me how to compute the original
limit, but, and this isn't the best way to

28
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:56,001
do this problem, but at least it
demonstrates that you could use Lopital in

29
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,812
a situation where you got infinity over
infinity.

30
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,745
Infinity.
But not every limit is something going to

31
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:06,233
zero over something going to zero, or
something going to infinity over something

32
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,461
going to infinity.
Sometimes you might have a limit where

33
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,619
it's a product, the first term is heading
towards zero and the second term is

34
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:17,299
heading towards infinity.
For example, here I'm asking what the

35
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:20,655
limit as x approaches infinity of sin of
one over x times x.

36
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:25,033
This first term, sine of 1 / x, that's
getting close to 0 when x is very large.

37
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:28,275
And the second term, just the x, that is
getting very big.

38
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:32,835
So this first term is having a tendency to
made this quantity smaller but the second

39
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:35,950
term is having a tendency to make the
quantity bigger.

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,227
You know, who wins?.
Well with lobitol/g the only thing that we

41
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:45,427
can really deal with is sort of a 0 over 0
situation or an infinity over infinity

42
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:51,002
situation and that's neither of these.
But we can transform this problem into one

43
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:55,242
of these situations.
So instead of calculating this limit I'll

44
00:02:55,242 --> 00:03:00,113
calculate the equivalent problem, the
limit as x approaches infinity.

45
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,362
Of sine 1 over x in the numerator divided
by 1 over x.

46
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:08,222
So instead of multiplying by something
which is going towards infinity, I'm going

47
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:12,325
to divide by its reciprocal.
The reciprocal of something going to

48
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,044
infinity, is going to 0.
So now I've got a situation where the

49
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:20,114
numerator is going to 0, and the
denominator is going to 0, and this

50
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:23,103
problem, equivalent to the original
problem.

51
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:28,233
Is now amenable to L'Hospital's rule.
So by L'Hospital's rule I would want to

52
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:33,763
differentiate the numerator, differentiate
the denominator and then look at that

53
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,932
limit to try to understand this original
limit.

54
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:42,356
Well, what's the derivative of, Of sine of
1 over x, it's cosine of 1 over x, because

55
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:47,946
the derivative of sine is cosine, times
the derivative of the inside, which is

56
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:51,686
minus 1 over x squared.
And I'm going to divide by the

57
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:56,423
derivitative of the denominator, which is
minus 1 over x squared.

58
00:03:56,424 --> 00:04:01,432
So, now how do I evaluate this limit?
Well, the good news is that I've got a

59
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:06,270
minus 1 over x squared in the numerator
and a minus 1 over x squared in the

60
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,896
denominator.
So this limit is the same as the limit as

61
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:13,191
x approaches infinity of just cosine of 1
over x.

62
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:18,592
But now, 1 over x is getting very close to
0 and what's cosine of a number close to

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,413
0?
It's 1.

64
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:24,133
So this original limit, is 1.
You might have something near 1, being

65
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,335
raised to a very high power.
Here's an example.

66
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:32,635
The limit as x approaches infinity, of 1
plus 1 over x, raised to the xth power.

67
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:37,870
So for very large values of x, the base
here, 1 plus 1 over x, that's close to 1,

68
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,722
but the exponent is very large.
If you take a number close to 1 and raise

69
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:45,968
it to a very.
Very high power it's actually unclear what

70
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,288
you're going to get.
Depending as to how quickly this is moving

71
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,997
towards 1 and how quickly this thing is
growing.

72
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:56,098
You get wildly different answers.
Now this is not 0 over 0 or infinity over

73
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:59,033
infinity.
So I've got to transform this problem into

74
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,322
something.
Thing that L'Hopital can handle.

75
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:06,027
The trick here is to use exponential
functions.

76
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:11,955
So I'm going to rewrite this as e to the
log of the limit as x approaches infinity

77
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:17,539
of 1 plus 1 over x to the xth power.
E to the log of something does nothing,

78
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,525
ritght?
These are inverse functions.

79
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:23,808
But, log of a limit is the limit of the
log.

80
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:28,852
So this is.
E to the limit as x approaches infinity of

81
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:32,820
the log of 1 plus 1 over x to the xth
power.

82
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,823
Now log as something to a power is that
power times the log, so this is e.

83
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:45,182
To the limit as X approaches infinity of X
times the log of one plus one over X.

84
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:50,622
Now what kind of situation am I in here?
X is very large but log of a number close

85
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:54,993
to one is close to zero.
This is big number times number close to

86
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,562
zero.
That's the infinity times zero

87
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:01,239
indeterminate form, so how am I going to
handle this?

88
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:05,263
We just saw a minute ago that I'm going to
handle this by.

89
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,762
Putting the infinity in the denominator
with the reciprocals to make this 0 over

90
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:14,121
0, the sort of thing that[INAUDIBLE] can
handle.

91
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:19,439
So this is e to the limit as x approaches
infinity of lg 1 plus 1 over x divided by

92
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,692
1 over x.
This is the same as this, but now I've got

93
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:26,921
something approaching 0 divided by
something approaching 0.

94
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:31,248
This is the sort of situation
that[INAUDIBLE] can help me with.

95
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:36,540
This is e to the limit, by lopital.
The derivative of the numerator divided by

96
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,461
the derivative of the denominator.
The derivative of log is one over the

97
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:46,791
inside function, times the derivative of
the inside, which is minus one over x

98
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,367
squared.
Divided by what's the derivative of 1 over

99
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:55,295
x, well it's the same thing here minus 1
over x squared and this is the limit as x

100
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:59,058
approaches infinity.
Now I've got a minus 1 over x squared

101
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:03,262
which cancels with the minus 1 over x
squared in the denominator.

102
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:07,130
And I've got 1 over 1 plus 1 over x as x
approaches infinity.

103
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,781
This is getting very close to one.
So this is e to the 1st power, which is e.

104
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:18,338
And that means that this original limit,
the limit of 1 plus 1 over x to the x

105
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,847
power as x approaches infinity, is equal
to e.

106
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:27,364
Or you might have a very large number,
being raised to a very small power.

107
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:32,782
For example, let's say I want to come up
with the limit as x approaches infinity of

108
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:37,109
x to the 1 over xth power.
So the base here is very large, which have

109
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:42,244
a tendency to make this number very big,
but the exponent is getting close to 0,

110
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:46,466
which would have a tendency to pull this
back down closer to 1.

111
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,671
So what is this?
Well we can try to transform this into the

112
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:56,152
sort of limit problem that[UNKNOWN] can
handle, and I can again do that with

113
00:07:56,152 --> 00:08:00,819
exponential functions.
So I can rewrite this as e to the log of

114
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,222
the limit of x to the 1 of xth power.
And this is the limit as x approaches

115
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:09,460
infinity.
Now, this is the log of a limit.

116
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,730
Which is the limit of the log of x to the
1 over xth power.

117
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,334
And this is the limit as x approaches
infinity.

118
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:21,074
But the log of something to a power is
that power.

119
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:24,812
So 1 over x times.
The log of the base as x approaches

120
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:28,266
infinity.
Now I've got 1 over x, which is the number

121
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:31,643
close to zero.
Times log of x, which is a very large

122
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,989
number.
This is zero times infinity, so to speak.

123
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:39,753
So I should try to transform this
indeterminate form into something that

124
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:44,401
labetalol can handle.
Well, we'll write this a e to the limit of

125
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:47,702
x approaching infinity, of say log x over
x.

126
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:51,023
This is infinity over infinity, so to
speak.

127
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:56,749
That's the sort of thing that L'Hopital's
okay with, so instead of taking this

128
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,842
limit.
I could look at the ratio of the

129
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:03,786
derivatives.
The derivative of log x is 1 over x.

130
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:08,774
The derivative of x is 1.
So I should look at the limit of 1 over x

131
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:14,506
over 1 as x approaches infinity.
Well, that limit is 0 and e to the 0 is 1,

132
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:20,111
so the limit of x to the 1 over x as x
approaches infinity is equal to 1.

133
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:24,482
Or you might have a limit that looks like
something going to infinity minus

134
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:28,402
something going to infinity.
So let's try to compute the limit as x

135
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,366
approaches infinity of the square root of
x squared plus x minus x.

136
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,266
So this is a very large number minus a
very large.

137
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:40,046
The infinity minus infinity situation.
So we should try to factor this or rewrite

138
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,726
this to get it into a zero over zero or
infinity over infinity.

139
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,438
The sort of thing I could apply lopitol/g
to.

140
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,802
2.
So I could try to pull out an x from this,

141
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:55,548
because x is going to infinity.
I know x is a large positive number here.

142
00:09:55,548 --> 00:10:01,032
So I could rewrite this as x times, so
what if I pull out an x from here?

143
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:06,922
That's the square root of 1 plus 1 over x.
Minus, when I pull out an extra one here I

144
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,518
get minus 1.
So really, this limit, for large values of

145
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:15,653
x, so as x approaches infinity, is the
same as x times this quantity, the square

146
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:19,168
root of 1 plus 1 over x minus 1.
This is a large number.

147
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:23,892
What do I know about this number?
Well this is the square root of 1 plus the

148
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:27,600
reciprocal of a large number.
This is close to 1 minus 1.

149
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,813
This second term is close to zero.
This is infinity times 0 in determinate

150
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:38,598
form.
So I could rewrite this using our standard

151
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:43,795
trick as 1 plus 1 over x minus 1.
So this is now the numerator.

152
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:46,905
This thing's going to 0 divided by 1 over
x.

153
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:51,353
The reciprocal of this.
But I'm dividing by it, and that's the

154
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:55,531
same as multiplying.
So now I've got 0 divided by a number

155
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,027
close to 0.
I, it's 0 over 0 in determinate form.

156
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:03,847
So lopital tells me I can analyze this by
looking at the ratio of the, The

157
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:09,491
derivatives, so I should look at the limit
as x approaches infinity of, what's the

158
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:13,834
derivative of this?
Well, the derivative of the square root is

159
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:18,954
one over two square root of the inside
function, one plus one over x, times the

160
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:23,192
derivative of the inside function.
So the derivative of 1 over x.

161
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:27,546
And I don't have to worry about the minus
1, because the derivitive of that's 0.

162
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:32,242
And I divide by the derivitave of the
denominator, so I'll just write derivative

163
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:35,752
1 over x.
So now I've got derivative 1 over x in the

164
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:39,660
numerator, derivative 1 over x in the
denominator.

165
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,958
This limit then, should be same as just
the limit of this.

166
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,634
So I should be looking at the limit as x
approaches infinity of 1 over 2 square

167
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,677
root.
Of one plus one over x.

168
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:56,494
Well, what's one plus on over x as x
approaches infinity, that's just one.

169
00:11:56,494 --> 00:12:01,458
So this is one over two square root of a
number close to one, this is one half.

170
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,926
And, indeed, this original limit really is
one half.

171
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:10,002
I mean, honestly, we didn't need l'hopital
to calculate that, but we could use

172
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:13,131
l'hopital if we wanted to.
To evaluate this limit.

173
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,669
Okay, okay.
Let's summarize all the possibilities.

174
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,062
So here's this summary of everything you
might see in the[INAUDIBLE].

175
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:22,530
If you see zero over zero, or infinity
over infinity in a limit problem.

176
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,652
You can just apply L'Hopital, in that
case.

177
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:28,036
But here, I've lifted off some of the
other things that you might see.

178
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,430
And these in equations, there's no
nonsense equations, right?

179
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,133
But I hope they kind of tell you what you
should do.

180
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:38,299
So if you see, say 0 times infinity in a
limit, and by that I mean, it's a product

181
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,325
of things, one of which is limit 0, the
other of which has limit infinity.

182
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:46,245
Well, you should transform this into one
of these cases so you can apply L'Hopital.

183
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:51,605
So you could do that by moving the 0 into
the denominator, and taking its reciprocal

184
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:56,408
This is really infinity over infinity.
Or, you could move the infinity in the

185
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,336
denominator, and take its reciprocal.
And now you've got 0 over 0.

186
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:04,662
If you see 1 to a very large power, or
something close to 1 to a large power,

187
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:07,356
right?
You can use either the log to transform

188
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,966
this.
And e to the log of this is e to the large

189
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:14,247
number times log of number close to 1.
Log of a number close to 1 is close to

190
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,770
zero.
This is an infinity times 0 indeterminate

191
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,838
form.
But you know how to handle those.

192
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:21,539
Because you can convert them back into
these cases.

193
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,935
Which you can then use[INAUDIBLE].
If you see infinity to the 0.

194
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:27,426
Well, you could use the same e to the log
trick.

195
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,398
And then the exponent here is 0 times log
of a big number.

196
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,889
Or a number close to 0 times log of a big
number.

197
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,741
But this is the 0 times infinity
indeterminate form, which is right here.

198
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:40,650
We should transform you to these cases,
which you then use L'Hopital on.

199
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:45,407
If you see 0 to the 0, by which I mean, a
number close to 0 raised to a power close

200
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,982
to 0, you can again use the e to the log
trick And this is e to a number close to

201
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:54,185
0, times log and a number close to 0.
What's log of a very small number?

202
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:57,826
That's very negative.
So, this exponent is, again, the 0 times

203
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:02,434
infinity in determinate form, which you
can then convert into this and apply

204
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:05,887
L'Hopital To it.
The last case is this infinity minus

205
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:11,167
infinity case, and there, one thing you
could try to do is put it over some common

206
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:16,447
denominator, so I'm thinking of the common
denominator here as being 1 over the

207
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:21,647
product of these two terms, and here I've
got 1 over the second term minus 1 over

208
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:25,542
the first term.
But the point here is that you can rewrite

209
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:32,654
this difference of very large quantities.
As a something getting close to 0 divided

210
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:39,537
by something getting close to 0.
Which is the sort of thing that you could

211
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,704
then apply L'Hopital.
