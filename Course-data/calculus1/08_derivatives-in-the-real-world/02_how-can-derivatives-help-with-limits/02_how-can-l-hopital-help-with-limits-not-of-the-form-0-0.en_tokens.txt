we
already
know
how
to
calculate
limits
that
are
a
very
small
number
divided
by
a
very
small
number
a
zero
over
zero
form
.
so
we
've
seen
[
unknown
]
patel
's
rule
for
the
situation
when
limit
the
numerator
limit
of
the
denominator
of
both
zero
,
but
it
turns
out
that
[
inaudible
]
rule
is
also
valid
when
the
limit
of
the
numerator
and
the
limit
of
the
denominator
are
both
infinity
.
i
mean
you
still
got
all
the
other
conditions
.
you
got
ta
check
that
the
limit
of
the
ratio
of
the
derivative
exists
,
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
is
not
zero
.
for
values
of
x
near
a.
but
given
these
conditions
,
you
then
get
the
same
fantastic
conclusion
.
that
the
limit
of
f
over
g
is
the
limit
of
the
derivative
of
f
over
the
derivative
of
g.
let
's
take
a
look
at
an
example
.
well
,
here
's
an
example
.
this
is
an
example
,
you
really
do
n't
need
to
use
[
unknown
]
a
lot
,
but
at
least
it
demonstrates
what
the
technique
is
.
the
limit
on
the
numerator
is
infinity
,
the
limit
ofthe
denominator
is
also
infinity
,
though
that
's
maybe
a
little
bit
harder
to
see
.
and
consequently
we
could
use
lopatol/g
,
and
it
would
tell
us
to
compute
instead
the
derivative
the
numerator
.
which
is
4
x
plus
0
,
divided
by
the
derivative
the
denominator
,
which
is
6
x
minus
1.
now
can
i
calculate
the
limit
of
this
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
yes
,
of
course
i
could
just
do
this
directly
too
but
i
could
again
use
lowbatal
of
i
really
wanted
to
.
the
limit
of
the
numerator
is
infinity
,
the
limit
of
denominator
is
infinity
.
so
lobatall
tells
me
to
instead
consider
the
ratio
of
derivatives
,
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
is
4
,
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
is
6.
and
now
i
'm
in
a
situation
where
i
'm
just
taking
the
limit
of
a
constant
over
a
constant
.
that
means
that
limit
is
4
6th
,
which
then
tells
me
how
to
compute
the
original
limit
,
but
,
and
this
is
n't
the
best
way
to
do
this
problem
,
but
at
least
it
demonstrates
that
you
could
use
lopital
in
a
situation
where
you
got
infinity
over
infinity
.
infinity
.
but
not
every
limit
is
something
going
to
zero
over
something
going
to
zero
,
or
something
going
to
infinity
over
something
going
to
infinity
.
sometimes
you
might
have
a
limit
where
it
's
a
product
,
the
first
term
is
heading
towards
zero
and
the
second
term
is
heading
towards
infinity
.
for
example
,
here
i
'm
asking
what
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
sin
of
one
over
x
times
x.
this
first
term
,
sine
of
1
/
x
,
that
's
getting
close
to
0
when
x
is
very
large
.
and
the
second
term
,
just
the
x
,
that
is
getting
very
big
.
so
this
first
term
is
having
a
tendency
to
made
this
quantity
smaller
but
the
second
term
is
having
a
tendency
to
make
the
quantity
bigger
.
you
know
,
who
wins
?
.
well
with
lobitol/g
the
only
thing
that
we
can
really
deal
with
is
sort
of
a
0
over
0
situation
or
an
infinity
over
infinity
situation
and
that
's
neither
of
these
.
but
we
can
transform
this
problem
into
one
of
these
situations
.
so
instead
of
calculating
this
limit
i
'll
calculate
the
equivalent
problem
,
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
of
sine
1
over
x
in
the
numerator
divided
by
1
over
x.
so
instead
of
multiplying
by
something
which
is
going
towards
infinity
,
i
'm
going
to
divide
by
its
reciprocal
.
the
reciprocal
of
something
going
to
infinity
,
is
going
to
0.
so
now
i
've
got
a
situation
where
the
numerator
is
going
to
0
,
and
the
denominator
is
going
to
0
,
and
this
problem
,
equivalent
to
the
original
problem
.
is
now
amenable
to
l'hospital
's
rule
.
so
by
l'hospital
's
rule
i
would
want
to
differentiate
the
numerator
,
differentiate
the
denominator
and
then
look
at
that
limit
to
try
to
understand
this
original
limit
.
well
,
what
's
the
derivative
of
,
of
sine
of
1
over
x
,
it
's
cosine
of
1
over
x
,
because
the
derivative
of
sine
is
cosine
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
,
which
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
.
and
i
'm
going
to
divide
by
the
derivitative
of
the
denominator
,
which
is
minus
1
over
x
squared
.
so
,
now
how
do
i
evaluate
this
limit
?
well
,
the
good
news
is
that
i
've
got
a
minus
1
over
x
squared
in
the
numerator
and
a
minus
1
over
x
squared
in
the
denominator
.
so
this
limit
is
the
same
as
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
just
cosine
of
1
over
x.
but
now
,
1
over
x
is
getting
very
close
to
0
and
what
's
cosine
of
a
number
close
to
0
?
it
's
1.
so
this
original
limit
,
is
1.
you
might
have
something
near
1
,
being
raised
to
a
very
high
power
.
here
's
an
example
.
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
of
1
plus
1
over
x
,
raised
to
the
xth
power
.
so
for
very
large
values
of
x
,
the
base
here
,
1
plus
1
over
x
,
that
's
close
to
1
,
but
the
exponent
is
very
large
.
if
you
take
a
number
close
to
1
and
raise
it
to
a
very
.
very
high
power
it
's
actually
unclear
what
you
're
going
to
get
.
depending
as
to
how
quickly
this
is
moving
towards
1
and
how
quickly
this
thing
is
growing
.
you
get
wildly
different
answers
.
now
this
is
not
0
over
0
or
infinity
over
infinity
.
so
i
've
got
to
transform
this
problem
into
something
.
thing
that
l'hopital
can
handle
.
the
trick
here
is
to
use
exponential
functions
.
so
i
'm
going
to
rewrite
this
as
e
to
the
log
of
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
1
plus
1
over
x
to
the
xth
power
.
e
to
the
log
of
something
does
nothing
,
ritght
?
these
are
inverse
functions
.
but
,
log
of
a
limit
is
the
limit
of
the
log
.
so
this
is
.
e
to
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
the
log
of
1
plus
1
over
x
to
the
xth
power
.
now
log
as
something
to
a
power
is
that
power
times
the
log
,
so
this
is
e.
to
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
x
times
the
log
of
one
plus
one
over
x.
now
what
kind
of
situation
am
i
in
here
?
x
is
very
large
but
log
of
a
number
close
to
one
is
close
to
zero
.
this
is
big
number
times
number
close
to
zero
.
that
's
the
infinity
times
zero
indeterminate
form
,
so
how
am
i
going
to
handle
this
?
we
just
saw
a
minute
ago
that
i
'm
going
to
handle
this
by
.
putting
the
infinity
in
the
denominator
with
the
reciprocals
to
make
this
0
over
0
,
the
sort
of
thing
that
[
inaudible
]
can
handle
.
so
this
is
e
to
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
lg
1
plus
1
over
x
divided
by
1
over
x.
this
is
the
same
as
this
,
but
now
i
've
got
something
approaching
0
divided
by
something
approaching
0.
this
is
the
sort
of
situation
that
[
inaudible
]
can
help
me
with
.
this
is
e
to
the
limit
,
by
lopital
.
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
divided
by
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
.
the
derivative
of
log
is
one
over
the
inside
function
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
,
which
is
minus
one
over
x
squared
.
divided
by
what
's
the
derivative
of
1
over
x
,
well
it
's
the
same
thing
here
minus
1
over
x
squared
and
this
is
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
now
i
've
got
a
minus
1
over
x
squared
which
cancels
with
the
minus
1
over
x
squared
in
the
denominator
.
and
i
've
got
1
over
1
plus
1
over
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
this
is
getting
very
close
to
one
.
so
this
is
e
to
the
1st
power
,
which
is
e.
and
that
means
that
this
original
limit
,
the
limit
of
1
plus
1
over
x
to
the
x
power
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
is
equal
to
e.
or
you
might
have
a
very
large
number
,
being
raised
to
a
very
small
power
.
for
example
,
let
's
say
i
want
to
come
up
with
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
x
to
the
1
over
xth
power
.
so
the
base
here
is
very
large
,
which
have
a
tendency
to
make
this
number
very
big
,
but
the
exponent
is
getting
close
to
0
,
which
would
have
a
tendency
to
pull
this
back
down
closer
to
1.
so
what
is
this
?
well
we
can
try
to
transform
this
into
the
sort
of
limit
problem
that
[
unknown
]
can
handle
,
and
i
can
again
do
that
with
exponential
functions
.
so
i
can
rewrite
this
as
e
to
the
log
of
the
limit
of
x
to
the
1
of
xth
power
.
and
this
is
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
now
,
this
is
the
log
of
a
limit
.
which
is
the
limit
of
the
log
of
x
to
the
1
over
xth
power
.
and
this
is
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
but
the
log
of
something
to
a
power
is
that
power
.
so
1
over
x
times
.
the
log
of
the
base
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
now
i
've
got
1
over
x
,
which
is
the
number
close
to
zero
.
times
log
of
x
,
which
is
a
very
large
number
.
this
is
zero
times
infinity
,
so
to
speak
.
so
i
should
try
to
transform
this
indeterminate
form
into
something
that
labetalol
can
handle
.
well
,
we
'll
write
this
a
e
to
the
limit
of
x
approaching
infinity
,
of
say
log
x
over
x.
this
is
infinity
over
infinity
,
so
to
speak
.
that
's
the
sort
of
thing
that
l'hopital
's
okay
with
,
so
instead
of
taking
this
limit
.
i
could
look
at
the
ratio
of
the
derivatives
.
the
derivative
of
log
x
is
1
over
x.
the
derivative
of
x
is
1.
so
i
should
look
at
the
limit
of
1
over
x
over
1
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
well
,
that
limit
is
0
and
e
to
the
0
is
1
,
so
the
limit
of
x
to
the
1
over
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
is
equal
to
1.
or
you
might
have
a
limit
that
looks
like
something
going
to
infinity
minus
something
going
to
infinity
.
so
let
's
try
to
compute
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
the
square
root
of
x
squared
plus
x
minus
x.
so
this
is
a
very
large
number
minus
a
very
large
.
the
infinity
minus
infinity
situation
.
so
we
should
try
to
factor
this
or
rewrite
this
to
get
it
into
a
zero
over
zero
or
infinity
over
infinity
.
the
sort
of
thing
i
could
apply
lopitol/g
to
.
so
i
could
try
to
pull
out
an
x
from
this
,
because
x
is
going
to
infinity
.
i
know
x
is
a
large
positive
number
here
.
so
i
could
rewrite
this
as
x
times
,
so
what
if
i
pull
out
an
x
from
here
?
that
's
the
square
root
of
1
plus
1
over
x.
minus
,
when
i
pull
out
an
extra
one
here
i
get
minus
1.
so
really
,
this
limit
,
for
large
values
of
x
,
so
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
is
the
same
as
x
times
this
quantity
,
the
square
root
of
1
plus
1
over
x
minus
1.
this
is
a
large
number
.
what
do
i
know
about
this
number
?
well
this
is
the
square
root
of
1
plus
the
reciprocal
of
a
large
number
.
this
is
close
to
1
minus
1.
this
second
term
is
close
to
zero
.
this
is
infinity
times
0
in
determinate
form
.
so
i
could
rewrite
this
using
our
standard
trick
as
1
plus
1
over
x
minus
1.
so
this
is
now
the
numerator
.
this
thing
's
going
to
0
divided
by
1
over
x.
the
reciprocal
of
this
.
but
i
'm
dividing
by
it
,
and
that
's
the
same
as
multiplying
.
so
now
i
've
got
0
divided
by
a
number
close
to
0.
i
,
it
's
0
over
0
in
determinate
form
.
so
lopital
tells
me
i
can
analyze
this
by
looking
at
the
ratio
of
the
,
the
derivatives
,
so
i
should
look
at
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
,
what
's
the
derivative
of
this
?
well
,
the
derivative
of
the
square
root
is
one
over
two
square
root
of
the
inside
function
,
one
plus
one
over
x
,
times
the
derivative
of
the
inside
function
.
so
the
derivative
of
1
over
x.
and
i
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
the
minus
1
,
because
the
derivitive
of
that
's
0.
and
i
divide
by
the
derivitave
of
the
denominator
,
so
i
'll
just
write
derivative
1
over
x.
so
now
i
've
got
derivative
1
over
x
in
the
numerator
,
derivative
1
over
x
in
the
denominator
.
this
limit
then
,
should
be
same
as
just
the
limit
of
this
.
so
i
should
be
looking
at
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
of
1
over
2
square
root
.
of
one
plus
one
over
x.
well
,
what
's
one
plus
on
over
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
that
's
just
one
.
so
this
is
one
over
two
square
root
of
a
number
close
to
one
,
this
is
one
half
.
and
,
indeed
,
this
original
limit
really
is
one
half
.
i
mean
,
honestly
,
we
did
n't
need
l'hopital
to
calculate
that
,
but
we
could
use
l'hopital
if
we
wanted
to
.
to
evaluate
this
limit
.
okay
,
okay
.
let
's
summarize
all
the
possibilities
.
so
here
's
this
summary
of
everything
you
might
see
in
the
[
inaudible
]
.
if
you
see
zero
over
zero
,
or
infinity
over
infinity
in
a
limit
problem
.
you
can
just
apply
l'hopital
,
in
that
case
.
but
here
,
i
've
lifted
off
some
of
the
other
things
that
you
might
see
.
and
these
in
equations
,
there
's
no
nonsense
equations
,
right
?
but
i
hope
they
kind
of
tell
you
what
you
should
do
.
so
if
you
see
,
say
0
times
infinity
in
a
limit
,
and
by
that
i
mean
,
it
's
a
product
of
things
,
one
of
which
is
limit
0
,
the
other
of
which
has
limit
infinity
.
well
,
you
should
transform
this
into
one
of
these
cases
so
you
can
apply
l'hopital
.
so
you
could
do
that
by
moving
the
0
into
the
denominator
,
and
taking
its
reciprocal
this
is
really
infinity
over
infinity
.
or
,
you
could
move
the
infinity
in
the
denominator
,
and
take
its
reciprocal
.
and
now
you
've
got
0
over
0.
if
you
see
1
to
a
very
large
power
,
or
something
close
to
1
to
a
large
power
,
right
?
you
can
use
either
the
log
to
transform
this
.
and
e
to
the
log
of
this
is
e
to
the
large
number
times
log
of
number
close
to
1.
log
of
a
number
close
to
1
is
close
to
zero
.
this
is
an
infinity
times
0
indeterminate
form
.
but
you
know
how
to
handle
those
.
because
you
can
convert
them
back
into
these
cases
.
which
you
can
then
use
[
inaudible
]
.
if
you
see
infinity
to
the
0.
well
,
you
could
use
the
same
e
to
the
log
trick
.
and
then
the
exponent
here
is
0
times
log
of
a
big
number
.
or
a
number
close
to
0
times
log
of
a
big
number
.
but
this
is
the
0
times
infinity
indeterminate
form
,
which
is
right
here
.
we
should
transform
you
to
these
cases
,
which
you
then
use
l'hopital
on
.
if
you
see
0
to
the
0
,
by
which
i
mean
,
a
number
close
to
0
raised
to
a
power
close
to
0
,
you
can
again
use
the
e
to
the
log
trick
and
this
is
e
to
a
number
close
to
0
,
times
log
and
a
number
close
to
0.
what
's
log
of
a
very
small
number
?
that
's
very
negative
.
so
,
this
exponent
is
,
again
,
the
0
times
infinity
in
determinate
form
,
which
you
can
then
convert
into
this
and
apply
l'hopital
to
it
.
the
last
case
is
this
infinity
minus
infinity
case
,
and
there
,
one
thing
you
could
try
to
do
is
put
it
over
some
common
denominator
,
so
i
'm
thinking
of
the
common
denominator
here
as
being
1
over
the
product
of
these
two
terms
,
and
here
i
've
got
1
over
the
second
term
minus
1
over
the
first
term
.
but
the
point
here
is
that
you
can
rewrite
this
difference
of
very
large
quantities
.
as
a
something
getting
close
to
0
divided
by
something
getting
close
to
0.
which
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
could
then
apply
l'hopital
.
