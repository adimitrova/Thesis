music there plenty limits that 
really quite hard to evaluate 
heres an example 
take limit x approaches 
square root x minus , divided x 
minus 
admittedly, that limits really that 
difficult to calculate 
alright 
limit is th 
we also think this, maybe a 
little bit intuitively 
look whats going 
limit numerator is , right 
x approaches , square root a 
number close to minus is close to 
limit denominator is also 
limit denominator 
is , i cant use limit 
quotients quotient limits deal 
to evaluate this limit, right 
im genuinely in a difficult situation 
problem is that numerator 
close to zero, is trying to make 
this ratio small 
denominator is close to zero, 
trying to make this ratio really big 
neither numerator 
denominator win game 
right 
forces balance off, giving 
answer th 

well, we see this geometrically 
so here ive graphed in green function 
squared x minus 
thats numerator 
in orange ive graphed x minus 
y equals x minus 
you see that x is equal to , 
curves cross x axis 
i plug in here, i get zero 
i plug in here, i get zero 
also note that green curve is 
getting closer to zero quickly 
orange curve 
lets replace two functions 
approximations that we get using 
derivative 
now, let replace this green curve 
tangent line to green curve 
point green curve crosses 
xaxis 
well, here i go 
heres a picture that tangent 
line 
i could compute that tangent line 
a little bit calculus 
alright 
this function is square root x 
minus 
if i differentiate that i get 
square root sub x, thats derivative 
square root function 
derivative minus is 
i evaluate that derivative , 
i get derivative is th, 
thats slope tangent line 
here to green curve 
i know that tangent line 
cross point , 
so heres equation that tangent line in 
point slope form i rewrite this a 
little bit nicely y equals a 
quarter x minus 
so happens to limit problem 
we replace expressions 
tangent lines 
so instead thinking this 
geometrically, i look back 
this original limit problem, replace 
pieces tangent lines 
we calculated tangent line to 
graph square root x minus 
to one quarter times x minus , 
denominator is already a straight line 
so, if i replace numerator 
denominator straight line 
approximations that good inputs 
near , this original limit problem is 
transformed this limit problem 
this limit problem is really easy to 
do, right 
ive got an x minus in numerator 
an x minus in denominator 
so this limit is quarter 
important to emphasize that we really 
havent done anything new here 
we could calculated this limit even 
without thinking derivatives 
tangent lines, this perspective opens 
a new way approaching limit 
problems 
so heres i package this 
a situation thats maybe useful 
generally 
suppose i got two functions, i got a 
function f a function g 
lets suppose limit f x 
approaches a is limit g x 
x approaches a is also 
kicks, lets suppose that f 
g also differentiable, twice 
differentiable, you know, i want to 
really nice functions 
lets suppose i want to try to 
calculate limit f x g x, 
x approaches a 
this might a difficult limit to 
calculate 
we saw is that we could try 
to understand this a little bit better 
replacing f g tangent line 
approximations 
another way to say that is im going 
to replace f x g x 
approximations that i get considering 
derivative, right 
so, limit f x g x 
close to this f x is close 
to this, right 
value f a plus 
derivative f a times much 
input changes i go a to x 
thats approximately f x 
this denominator g 
x 
g a plus derivative g a 
times x minus a, thats g x 
so if you believe that numerator 
denominator here approximately f x 
g x, you might believe that 
limits also equal 
this is a really great situation to 
in f a say is equal to if f 
is continuous there, maybe since 
differentiable 
g a is also equal to since g is 
continuous 
so that f a g a terms go 
away 
ive got an x minus a an x 
minus a term there, so also cancel, 
im left is f prime a 
divided g prime a 
so seems like if you try to calculate 
limit this ratio, whats really 
relevant is understanding something 
derivatives numerator 
denominator separately 
that point a 
precise statement this is usually 
called lhopitals rule 
so heres a statement lhopitals rule 
suppose i got two functions f g 
theyre differentiable inputs near a, 
limit f x limit g 
x x approaches a 
so functions output is small 
input is close to a 
limit derivative f 
divided derivative g x 
approaches a, exists 
derivative g is , i 
evaluate that derivative inputs near 
a 
if conditions true, 
i get fantastic conclusion that 
limit f x g x 
is limit derivative f 
derivative g 
hope is that this limit is easier 
to compute original limit 
lets try to use lhopitals rule in a 
much trickier context 
so heres an example, lets compute 
limit x approaches zero cosine x 
minus one minus x quote two 
x th power 
we using lhopitals rule 
so limit numerator is zero 
limit denominator is zero 
really nice functions, so 
theyre nice enough us to apply 
lhopital 
so i calculate limit 
derivative numerator, divided 
derivative denominator that 
might help compute this original limit 
so here we go 
derivative numerator is minus 
sign x, thats derivative cosine 
minus zero, thats derivative 
minus x, thats derivative x 
squared 
divided by, whats derivative x to 
th 
x cubed 
here, im in a situation 
limit numerator is , 
limit sin x x approaches is 
limit x x approaches is 
so, limit numerator is 
limit denominator is also 
so heres funny thing 
i could try to apply lhopital to 
understand this limit 
so here we go 
ill use lhopital 
ill differentiate numerator 
derivative minus sin is minus 
cosine 
derivative x is 
so this is minus cosine x minus 
divided derivative 
denominator is times x squared, 
x squared 
kind situation i in here 
well here, numerator limit 
cosines limit is 
attracting 
limit denominator is also 
, so im in a situation 
numerator denominator heading 
toward 
so to understand this, i could use 
lhopital to look quickly 
terms dying 
so i apply lhopital again, lhopital 
tells to look derivative 
numerator 
derivative minus cosine x, is 
sine x 
minus , well thats , divided 
limit denominator 
well, whats derivative 
denominator 
x 
so im in a situation 
numerator denominator limit 
so i could apply lhopital, 
would tell to look derivative 
numerator derivative 
denominator 
derivative numerator is cosine 
x derivative denominator is 
look, numerator limit , 
denominator limit , 
a constant 
so this is a limit quotient 
quotient limit, so this limit is, is 
th 
now, lhopital tells that this 
limit equal to th makes this 
limit equal to th 
this limit exists, 
tells that this limit is also equal to 
th 
this limit exists 
tells that this limit is equal to 
th 
this limit exists 
tells that original limit is 
th
