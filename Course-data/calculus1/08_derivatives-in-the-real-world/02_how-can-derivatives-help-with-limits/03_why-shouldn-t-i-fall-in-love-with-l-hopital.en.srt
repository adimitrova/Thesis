1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,044
[MUSIC] People often have this idea that 
l'Hopital's rule is really great. 

2
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:11,921
I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't 
fall in love with l'Hopital's rule. 

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:17,210
For one thing, l'Hopital's rule often 
leads to circular reasoning. 

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,820
Let's go to the blackboard and take a 
look. 

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,467
For example, 
here's a problem that you might be 

6
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:29,837
tempted to use l'Hopital on. 
You know, in a limit as x approaches zero 

7
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,609
of sine x over x. 
Now, what do you have to check? 

8
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,032
Well, let's take a look at the limit of 
the numerator by itself. 

9
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:40,433
The limit of sine x as x approaches zero, 
sine is continuous so that limit is just 

10
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,858
sine of zero, which is zero. 
Numerator's limit is zero. 

11
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:48,605
Limit of our denominator? 
the limit of x as x approaches zero is 

12
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,584
zero. 
So, yeah. 

13
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,899
This is a zero over zero indeterminate 
form. 

14
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,023
So, we have tried using l'Hopital. 
l'Hopital tells us that this limit is 

15
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:04,125
equal to the limit as x approaches zero 
of the derivative of the numerator, which 

16
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:09,500
is cosine x over the derivative of the 
denominator, which is one. 

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,649
Now, this limit is quite a bit easier to 
do, right? 

18
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:16,634
This is really just the limit of cosin x 
as x approaches zero. 

19
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:22,360
Cosine is continuous so this is just the 
value of cosine at zero, which is one. 

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,547
And yeah, 
I mean, the limit of sine x over x as x 

21
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:28,092
it approaches zero, 
it is, in fact, one. 

22
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:29,909
This looks good, 
alright? 

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,292
The, the question though is how did you 
know that the derivative of sine X was 

24
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,158
cosine x? 
You needed to know that in order to apply 

25
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:41,723
l'Hopital. 
How did you know the derivative of sine x 

26
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:44,100
was cosine x? 
Well, let's think back. 

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,704
Right. 
So, how did I know that the derivative of 

28
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:53,927
sine x was cosine x? 
Well, taking a derivative is the same 

29
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:57,094
thing as a limit of a difference 
quotient. 

30
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:02,825
So, to calculate, say, the derivative of 
sine at zero, I take a limit like this. 

31
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:08,580
The limit if h goes to zero of sine 0 + h 
- sine 0 / h. 

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,757
Sine of zero is just zero. 
So, calculating this limit, which is 

33
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:20,438
calculating the derivative of sine at 0, 
is really the same as calculating the 

34
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:27,120
limit as h goes to zero, 
sine 0 + h, that's just sign h - 0 / h. 

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,741
Now, what just happened? 
I wanted to calculate the derivative of 

36
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:36,197
sine at zero, and to calculate the 
derivative of sine at zero, is really the 

37
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:40,104
same as calculating the limit at h goes 
to zero of sine h over h. 

38
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:45,424
It's the definition of derivative. 
And I was going to use this to evaluate 

39
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,750
the limit of sine x over x using 
l'Hopital, 

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,736
right? l'Hopital doesn't just reduce a 
limit problem down to another limit 

41
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:55,160
problem. 
It reduces a limit problem down to a 

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,422
limit problem and two derivative 
problems, 

43
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,847
right? 
To, to do l'Hopital, you have to be able 

44
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,378
to differentiate the numerator and 
denominator. 

45
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,473
So, if you're going to use l'Hopital to 
evaluate sine x over x as x goes to zero, 

46
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,681
you're going to have to differentiate 
sine x. 

47
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:12,991
But then, to differentiate sin x at zero, 
which is what you're trying to do, to, to 

48
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:17,085
use l'Hopital, you have to be able to 
evaluate this limit, the limit of sine h 

49
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:19,401
over h. 
You have to be able to do the limit 

50
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:23,580
you're trying to do already. 
It's just circular reasoning. 

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,944
So, what just happened? 
I was trying to calculate the limit of 

52
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:29,909
sine x over x as x approaches zero. 
I used l'Hopital. 

53
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:36,181
l'Hopita told me to differentiate sine x. 
But then, to differentiate sine x, I 

54
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:40,686
would've needed to be able to evaluate 
the limit of sine h over h as h goes to 

55
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,138
zero, the exact problem I'm trying to 
solve. 

56
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:47,528
It's an example of circular reasoning. 
There's other things that can go wrong 

57
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,550
with l'Hopital. 
One of the conditions of l'Hopital is 

58
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,971
that the limit of the ratio of the 
derivatives has to exist. 

59
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,880
let's see an example where that fails to 
happen. 

60
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,888
Here's an example. 
Let's take a look at the limit of x plus 

61
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:06,636
sine x over x as x approaches infinity. 
Try to use l'Hopital. 

62
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:10,193
So, I want to look at the limit of the 
numerator by itself. 

63
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:14,195
The limit of x plus sine x as x 
approaches infinity is infinity. 

64
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:19,214
The limit of the denominator by itself, 
the limit of x as x approaches infinity, 

65
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:22,263
also infinity. 
This is an infinity over infinity 

66
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,360
indeterminate form. 
It seems good. 

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,308
Now, l'Hopital's tells me that to 
calculate this, I should look at the 

68
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:34,790
limit as x approaches infinity. 
The derivative of the numerator, which is 

69
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,580
one plus cosine x over the derivative of 
the denominator, which is one. 

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,440
Now, what's the limit of one plus cosine 
x as x approaches infinity? 

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,214
Well, the limit of one is just one. 
But what's the limit of cosine x as x 

72
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,660
approaches infinity, 
right? 

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,622
Cosine just oscillates between -1 and 1. 
This limit doesn't exist. 

74
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:10,364
This limit doesn't exist. 
Now, does that mean that this limit 

75
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,722
doesn't exist? 
I, I, I wrote equals here, but remember, 

76
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,895
I'm using l'Hopital's rule, 
alright. 

77
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:18,660
And what does l'Hopital's rule actually 
say? 

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,466
It says, that this limit is equal to the 
limit of the derivative over the 

79
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:28,404
derivative, provided this limit exists. 
And this limit doesn't exist in this 

80
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,170
case. 
So, l'Hopital is silent as to the value 

81
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,857
of this limit. 
Let's see if we can actually compute that 

82
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:39,124
limit some other way. 
Alright. 

83
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:42,299
So, let's try to do this limit some other 
way. 

84
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:47,521
We're going to do the limit of x plus 
sine over x as x goes to infinity without 

85
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:51,331
using l'Hopital. 
This is a limit of fraction, we could 

86
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:56,906
split up the fraction as a limit as x 
goes to infinity of x over x plus sine x 

87
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:00,127
over x. 
Now, that's a limit of a sum, which is 

88
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,666
the sum of the limits provided the limits 
exist. 

89
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:10,376
So, this is the limit as x goes to 
infinity of x over x plus the limit as x 

90
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:15,831
goes to infinity of sine x over x. 
Now, what's the limit x over x as x goes 

91
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,380
to infinity? 
Just one. 

92
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,911
What's the limit of sine x over x as x 
goes to infinity? 

93
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:27,118
Well, sine x is always between -1 and 1. 
And x here is going to infinity. 

94
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:32,045
I can make x as big as I like. 
So, question is can I make this as close 

95
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:33,664
to zero as I like? 
Yeah. 

96
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:39,434
By making x large enough, a number 
between -1 and 1 / x can be made as close 

97
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,291
to zero as I like. 
So, this limit is zero. 

98
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:47,526
[SOUND] So, the sum of the limits is one 
[SOUND] and that's the limit of the sum. 

99
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:53,380
That's the limit of x plus sine x over x. 
It's one as x goes to infinity. 

100
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,131
And this is true in spite of the fact 
that l'Hopital failed us, right? 

101
00:06:57,131 --> 00:07:00,938
When we did l'Hopital's in this problem, 
I was told to differentiate the 

102
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:05,193
numerator, divided it by the derivative 
of the denominator as x goes to infinity, 

103
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:09,700
and that derivative didn't exist. 
It was oscillating between zero and two. 

104
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,065
And in that case, l'Hopital is just 
silent. 

105
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:16,615
l'Hopital requires that limit of the 
ratio of the derivatives to exist, and if 

106
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:19,344
it doesn't exist, l'Hopital doesn't say 
anything. 

107
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:23,712
This limit does exist and then to see 
that requires some, some algebraic 

108
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:29,135
computation. 
So, we manage to evaluate that limit. 

109
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,907
The limit was one, but no thanks to 
l'Hopital. 

110
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:35,536
The limit of the ratio of the derivatives 
didn't exist, 

111
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:39,232
it was oscillating. 
We evaluated that limit by algebraic 

112
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:41,241
manipulation. 
And don't get me wrong. 

113
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,547
l'Hopital is awfully powerful. 
There's plenty of situations where you 

114
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,404
want to use l'Hopital. But often, you can 
get away with just doing some algebraic 

115
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,908
manipulation. 
So, I encourage you, when you're doing 

116
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:55,001
those limit problems, 
don't forget that you can just 

117
00:07:55,001 --> 00:08:01,475
algebraically manipulate things. 
There might be an easier way than 

118
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:07,655
bringing out l'Hopital. 
Only use l'Hopital if you absolutely have 

119
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:13,149
to use l'Hopital. 
In other words, don't fall in love with 

120
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,915
l'Hopital.
