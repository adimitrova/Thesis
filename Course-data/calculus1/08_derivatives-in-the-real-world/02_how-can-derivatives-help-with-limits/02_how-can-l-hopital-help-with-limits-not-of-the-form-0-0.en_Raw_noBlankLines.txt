music we already know how to calculate
limits that are a very small number
divided by a very small number a zero over
zero form
so weve seen unknown patels rule for
the situation when limit the numerator
limit of the denominator of both zero, but
it turns out thatinaudible rule is also
valid when the limit of the numerator and
the limit of the denominator are both
infinity
i mean you still got all the other
conditions
you gotta check that the limit of the
ratio of the derivative exists, the
derivative of the denominator is not zero
for values of x near a
but given these conditions, you then get
the same fantastic conclusion
that the limit of f over g is the limit of
the derivative of f over the derivative of
g
lets take a look at an example
well, heres an example
this is an example, you really dont need
to useunknown a lot, but at least it
demonstrates what the technique is
the limit on the numerator is infinity,
the limit ofthe denominator is also
infinity, though thats maybe a little bit
harder to see
and consequently we could use lopatolg,
and it would tell us to compute instead
the derivative the numerator
which is  x plus , divided by the
derivative the denominator, which is  x
minus 
now can i calculate the limit of this as x
approaches infinity
yes, of course i could just do this
directly too but i could again use
lowbatal of i really wanted to
the limit of the numerator is infinity,
the limit of denominator is infinity
so lobatall tells me to instead consider
the ratio of derivatives, the derivative
of the numerator is , the derivative of
the denominator is 
and now im in a situation where im just
taking the limit of a constant over a
constant
that means that limit is  th, which then
tells me how to compute the original
limit, but, and this isnt the best way to
do this problem, but at least it
demonstrates that you could use lopital in
a situation where you got infinity over
infinity
infinity
but not every limit is something going to
zero over something going to zero, or
something going to infinity over something
going to infinity
sometimes you might have a limit where
its a product, the first term is heading
towards zero and the second term is
heading towards infinity
for example, here im asking what the
limit as x approaches infinity of sin of
one over x times x
this first term, sine of   x, thats
getting close to  when x is very large
and the second term, just the x, that is
getting very big
so this first term is having a tendency to
made this quantity smaller but the second
term is having a tendency to make the
quantity bigger
you know, who wins
well with lobitolg the only thing that we
can really deal with is sort of a  over 
situation or an infinity over infinity
situation and thats neither of these
but we can transform this problem into one
of these situations
so instead of calculating this limit ill
calculate the equivalent problem, the
limit as x approaches infinity
of sine  over x in the numerator divided
by  over x
so instead of multiplying by something
which is going towards infinity, im going
to divide by its reciprocal
the reciprocal of something going to
infinity, is going to 
so now ive got a situation where the
numerator is going to , and the
denominator is going to , and this
problem, equivalent to the original
problem
is now amenable to lhospitals rule
so by lhospitals rule i would want to
differentiate the numerator, differentiate
the denominator and then look at that
limit to try to understand this original
limit
well, whats the derivative of, of sine of
 over x, its cosine of  over x, because
the derivative of sine is cosine, times
the derivative of the inside, which is
minus  over x squared
and im going to divide by the
derivitative of the denominator, which is
minus  over x squared
so, now how do i evaluate this limit
well, the good news is that ive got a
minus  over x squared in the numerator
and a minus  over x squared in the
denominator
so this limit is the same as the limit as
x approaches infinity of just cosine of 
over x
but now,  over x is getting very close to
 and whats cosine of a number close to
its 
so this original limit, is 
you might have something near , being
raised to a very high power
heres an example
the limit as x approaches infinity, of 
plus  over x, raised to the xth power
so for very large values of x, the base
here,  plus  over x, thats close to ,
but the exponent is very large
if you take a number close to  and raise
it to a very
very high power its actually unclear what
youre going to get
depending as to how quickly this is moving
towards  and how quickly this thing is
growing
you get wildly different answers
now this is not  over  or infinity over
infinity
so ive got to transform this problem into
something
thing that lhopital can handle
the trick here is to use exponential
functions
so im going to rewrite this as e to the
log of the limit as x approaches infinity
of  plus  over x to the xth power
e to the log of something does nothing,
ritght
these are inverse functions
but, log of a limit is the limit of the
log
so this is
e to the limit as x approaches infinity of
the log of  plus  over x to the xth
power
now log as something to a power is that
power times the log, so this is e
to the limit as x approaches infinity of x
times the log of one plus one over x
now what kind of situation am i in here
x is very large but log of a number close
to one is close to zero
this is big number times number close to
zero
thats the infinity times zero
indeterminate form, so how am i going to
handle this
we just saw a minute ago that im going to
handle this by
putting the infinity in the denominator
with the reciprocals to make this  over
, the sort of thing thatinaudible can
handle
so this is e to the limit as x approaches
infinity of lg  plus  over x divided by
 over x
this is the same as this, but now ive got
something approaching  divided by
something approaching 
this is the sort of situation
thatinaudible can help me with
this is e to the limit, by lopital
the derivative of the numerator divided by
the derivative of the denominator
the derivative of log is one over the
inside function, times the derivative of
the inside, which is minus one over x
squared
divided by whats the derivative of  over
x, well its the same thing here minus 
over x squared and this is the limit as x
approaches infinity
now ive got a minus  over x squared
which cancels with the minus  over x
squared in the denominator
and ive got  over  plus  over x as x
approaches infinity
this is getting very close to one
so this is e to the st power, which is e
and that means that this original limit,
the limit of  plus  over x to the x
power as x approaches infinity, is equal
to e
or you might have a very large number,
being raised to a very small power
for example, lets say i want to come up
with the limit as x approaches infinity of
x to the  over xth power
so the base here is very large, which have
a tendency to make this number very big,
but the exponent is getting close to ,
which would have a tendency to pull this
back down closer to 
so what is this
well we can try to transform this into the
sort of limit problem thatunknown can
handle, and i can again do that with
exponential functions
so i can rewrite this as e to the log of
the limit of x to the  of xth power
and this is the limit as x approaches
infinity
now, this is the log of a limit
which is the limit of the log of x to the
 over xth power
and this is the limit as x approaches
infinity
but the log of something to a power is
that power
so  over x times
the log of the base as x approaches
infinity
now ive got  over x, which is the number
close to zero
times log of x, which is a very large
number
this is zero times infinity, so to speak
so i should try to transform this
indeterminate form into something that
labetalol can handle
well, well write this a e to the limit of
x approaching infinity, of say log x over
x
this is infinity over infinity, so to
speak
thats the sort of thing that lhopitals
okay with, so instead of taking this
limit
i could look at the ratio of the
derivatives
the derivative of log x is  over x
the derivative of x is 
so i should look at the limit of  over x
over  as x approaches infinity
well, that limit is  and e to the  is ,
so the limit of x to the  over x as x
approaches infinity is equal to 
or you might have a limit that looks like
something going to infinity minus
something going to infinity
so lets try to compute the limit as x
approaches infinity of the square root of
x squared plus x minus x
so this is a very large number minus a
very large
the infinity minus infinity situation
so we should try to factor this or rewrite
this to get it into a zero over zero or
infinity over infinity
the sort of thing i could apply lopitolg
to
so i could try to pull out an x from this,
because x is going to infinity
i know x is a large positive number here
so i could rewrite this as x times, so
what if i pull out an x from here
thats the square root of  plus  over x
minus, when i pull out an extra one here i
get minus 
so really, this limit, for large values of
x, so as x approaches infinity, is the
same as x times this quantity, the square
root of  plus  over x minus 
this is a large number
what do i know about this number
well this is the square root of  plus the
reciprocal of a large number
this is close to  minus 
this second term is close to zero
this is infinity times  in determinate
form
so i could rewrite this using our standard
trick as  plus  over x minus 
so this is now the numerator
this things going to  divided by  over
x
the reciprocal of this
but im dividing by it, and thats the
same as multiplying
so now ive got  divided by a number
close to 
i, its  over  in determinate form
so lopital tells me i can analyze this by
looking at the ratio of the, the
derivatives, so i should look at the limit
as x approaches infinity of, whats the
derivative of this
well, the derivative of the square root is
one over two square root of the inside
function, one plus one over x, times the
derivative of the inside function
so the derivative of  over x
and i dont have to worry about the minus
, because the derivitive of thats 
and i divide by the derivitave of the
denominator, so ill just write derivative
 over x
so now ive got derivative  over x in the
numerator, derivative  over x in the
denominator
this limit then, should be same as just
the limit of this
so i should be looking at the limit as x
approaches infinity of  over  square
root
of one plus one over x
well, whats one plus on over x as x
approaches infinity, thats just one
so this is one over two square root of a
number close to one, this is one half
and, indeed, this original limit really is
one half
i mean, honestly, we didnt need lhopital
to calculate that, but we could use
lhopital if we wanted to
to evaluate this limit
okay, okay
lets summarize all the possibilities
so heres this summary of everything you
might see in theinaudible
if you see zero over zero, or infinity
over infinity in a limit problem
you can just apply lhopital, in that
case
but here, ive lifted off some of the
other things that you might see
and these in equations, theres no
nonsense equations, right
but i hope they kind of tell you what you
should do
so if you see, say  times infinity in a
limit, and by that i mean, its a product
of things, one of which is limit , the
other of which has limit infinity
well, you should transform this into one
of these cases so you can apply lhopital
so you could do that by moving the  into
the denominator, and taking its reciprocal
this is really infinity over infinity
or, you could move the infinity in the
denominator, and take its reciprocal
and now youve got  over 
if you see  to a very large power, or
something close to  to a large power,
right
you can use either the log to transform
this
and e to the log of this is e to the large
number times log of number close to 
log of a number close to  is close to
zero
this is an infinity times  indeterminate
form
but you know how to handle those
because you can convert them back into
these cases
which you can then useinaudible
if you see infinity to the 
well, you could use the same e to the log
trick
and then the exponent here is  times log
of a big number
or a number close to  times log of a big
number
but this is the  times infinity
indeterminate form, which is right here
we should transform you to these cases,
which you then use lhopital on
if you see  to the , by which i mean, a
number close to  raised to a power close
to , you can again use the e to the log
trick and this is e to a number close to
, times log and a number close to 
whats log of a very small number
thats very negative
so, this exponent is, again, the  times
infinity in determinate form, which you
can then convert into this and apply
lhopital to it
the last case is this infinity minus
infinity case, and there, one thing you
could try to do is put it over some common
denominator, so im thinking of the common
denominator here as being  over the
product of these two terms, and here ive
got  over the second term minus  over
the first term
but the point here is that you can rewrite
this difference of very large quantities
as a something getting close to  divided
by something getting close to 
which is the sort of thing that you could
then apply lhopital
