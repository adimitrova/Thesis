people
often
have
this
idea
that
l'hopital
's
rule
is
really
great
.
i
'm
going
to
tell
you
why
you
should
n't
fall
in
love
with
l'hopital
's
rule
.
for
one
thing
,
l'hopital
's
rule
often
leads
to
circular
reasoning
.
let
's
go
to
the
blackboard
and
take
a
look
.
for
example
,
here
's
a
problem
that
you
might
be
tempted
to
use
l'hopital
on
.
you
know
,
in
a
limit
as
x
approaches
zero
of
sine
x
over
x.
now
,
what
do
you
have
to
check
?
well
,
let
's
take
a
look
at
the
limit
of
the
numerator
by
itself
.
the
limit
of
sine
x
as
x
approaches
zero
,
sine
is
continuous
so
that
limit
is
just
sine
of
zero
,
which
is
zero
.
numerator
's
limit
is
zero
.
limit
of
our
denominator
?
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
zero
is
zero
.
so
,
yeah
.
this
is
a
zero
over
zero
indeterminate
form
.
so
,
we
have
tried
using
l'hopital
.
l'hopital
tells
us
that
this
limit
is
equal
to
the
limit
as
x
approaches
zero
of
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
,
which
is
cosine
x
over
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
,
which
is
one
.
now
,
this
limit
is
quite
a
bit
easier
to
do
,
right
?
this
is
really
just
the
limit
of
cosin
x
as
x
approaches
zero
.
cosine
is
continuous
so
this
is
just
the
value
of
cosine
at
zero
,
which
is
one
.
and
yeah
,
i
mean
,
the
limit
of
sine
x
over
x
as
x
it
approaches
zero
,
it
is
,
in
fact
,
one
.
this
looks
good
,
alright
?
the
,
the
question
though
is
how
did
you
know
that
the
derivative
of
sine
x
was
cosine
x
?
you
needed
to
know
that
in
order
to
apply
l'hopital
.
how
did
you
know
the
derivative
of
sine
x
was
cosine
x
?
well
,
let
's
think
back
.
right
.
so
,
how
did
i
know
that
the
derivative
of
sine
x
was
cosine
x
?
well
,
taking
a
derivative
is
the
same
thing
as
a
limit
of
a
difference
quotient
.
so
,
to
calculate
,
say
,
the
derivative
of
sine
at
zero
,
i
take
a
limit
like
this
.
the
limit
if
h
goes
to
zero
of
sine
0
+
h
-
sine
0
/
h.
sine
of
zero
is
just
zero
.
so
,
calculating
this
limit
,
which
is
calculating
the
derivative
of
sine
at
0
,
is
really
the
same
as
calculating
the
limit
as
h
goes
to
zero
,
sine
0
+
h
,
that
's
just
sign
h
-
0
/
h.
now
,
what
just
happened
?
i
wanted
to
calculate
the
derivative
of
sine
at
zero
,
and
to
calculate
the
derivative
of
sine
at
zero
,
is
really
the
same
as
calculating
the
limit
at
h
goes
to
zero
of
sine
h
over
h.
it
's
the
definition
of
derivative
.
and
i
was
going
to
use
this
to
evaluate
the
limit
of
sine
x
over
x
using
l'hopital
,
right
?
l'hopital
does
n't
just
reduce
a
limit
problem
down
to
another
limit
problem
.
it
reduces
a
limit
problem
down
to
a
limit
problem
and
two
derivative
problems
,
right
?
to
,
to
do
l'hopital
,
you
have
to
be
able
to
differentiate
the
numerator
and
denominator
.
so
,
if
you
're
going
to
use
l'hopital
to
evaluate
sine
x
over
x
as
x
goes
to
zero
,
you
're
going
to
have
to
differentiate
sine
x.
but
then
,
to
differentiate
sin
x
at
zero
,
which
is
what
you
're
trying
to
do
,
to
,
to
use
l'hopital
,
you
have
to
be
able
to
evaluate
this
limit
,
the
limit
of
sine
h
over
h.
you
have
to
be
able
to
do
the
limit
you
're
trying
to
do
already
.
it
's
just
circular
reasoning
.
so
,
what
just
happened
?
i
was
trying
to
calculate
the
limit
of
sine
x
over
x
as
x
approaches
zero
.
i
used
l'hopital
.
l'hopita
told
me
to
differentiate
sine
x.
but
then
,
to
differentiate
sine
x
,
i
would
've
needed
to
be
able
to
evaluate
the
limit
of
sine
h
over
h
as
h
goes
to
zero
,
the
exact
problem
i
'm
trying
to
solve
.
it
's
an
example
of
circular
reasoning
.
there
's
other
things
that
can
go
wrong
with
l'hopital
.
one
of
the
conditions
of
l'hopital
is
that
the
limit
of
the
ratio
of
the
derivatives
has
to
exist
.
let
's
see
an
example
where
that
fails
to
happen
.
here
's
an
example
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
the
limit
of
x
plus
sine
x
over
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
try
to
use
l'hopital
.
so
,
i
want
to
look
at
the
limit
of
the
numerator
by
itself
.
the
limit
of
x
plus
sine
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
is
infinity
.
the
limit
of
the
denominator
by
itself
,
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
also
infinity
.
this
is
an
infinity
over
infinity
indeterminate
form
.
it
seems
good
.
now
,
l'hopital
's
tells
me
that
to
calculate
this
,
i
should
look
at
the
limit
as
x
approaches
infinity
.
the
derivative
of
the
numerator
,
which
is
one
plus
cosine
x
over
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
,
which
is
one
.
now
,
what
's
the
limit
of
one
plus
cosine
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
?
well
,
the
limit
of
one
is
just
one
.
but
what
's
the
limit
of
cosine
x
as
x
approaches
infinity
,
right
?
cosine
just
oscillates
between
-1
and
1.
this
limit
does
n't
exist
.
this
limit
does
n't
exist
.
now
,
does
that
mean
that
this
limit
does
n't
exist
?
i
,
i
,
i
wrote
equals
here
,
but
remember
,
i
'm
using
l'hopital
's
rule
,
alright
.
and
what
does
l'hopital
's
rule
actually
say
?
it
says
,
that
this
limit
is
equal
to
the
limit
of
the
derivative
over
the
derivative
,
provided
this
limit
exists
.
and
this
limit
does
n't
exist
in
this
case
.
so
,
l'hopital
is
silent
as
to
the
value
of
this
limit
.
let
's
see
if
we
can
actually
compute
that
limit
some
other
way
.
alright
.
so
,
let
's
try
to
do
this
limit
some
other
way
.
we
're
going
to
do
the
limit
of
x
plus
sine
over
x
as
x
goes
to
infinity
without
using
l'hopital
.
this
is
a
limit
of
fraction
,
we
could
split
up
the
fraction
as
a
limit
as
x
goes
to
infinity
of
x
over
x
plus
sine
x
over
x.
now
,
that
's
a
limit
of
a
sum
,
which
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
so
,
this
is
the
limit
as
x
goes
to
infinity
of
x
over
x
plus
the
limit
as
x
goes
to
infinity
of
sine
x
over
x.
now
,
what
's
the
limit
x
over
x
as
x
goes
to
infinity
?
just
one
.
what
's
the
limit
of
sine
x
over
x
as
x
goes
to
infinity
?
well
,
sine
x
is
always
between
-1
and
1.
and
x
here
is
going
to
infinity
.
i
can
make
x
as
big
as
i
like
.
so
,
question
is
can
i
make
this
as
close
to
zero
as
i
like
?
yeah
.
by
making
x
large
enough
,
a
number
between
-1
and
1
/
x
can
be
made
as
close
to
zero
as
i
like
.
so
,
this
limit
is
zero
.
[
sound
]
so
,
the
sum
of
the
limits
is
one
[
sound
]
and
that
's
the
limit
of
the
sum
.
that
's
the
limit
of
x
plus
sine
x
over
x.
it
's
one
as
x
goes
to
infinity
.
and
this
is
true
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
l'hopital
failed
us
,
right
?
when
we
did
l'hopital
's
in
this
problem
,
i
was
told
to
differentiate
the
numerator
,
divided
it
by
the
derivative
of
the
denominator
as
x
goes
to
infinity
,
and
that
derivative
did
n't
exist
.
it
was
oscillating
between
zero
and
two
.
and
in
that
case
,
l'hopital
is
just
silent
.
l'hopital
requires
that
limit
of
the
ratio
of
the
derivatives
to
exist
,
and
if
it
does
n't
exist
,
l'hopital
does
n't
say
anything
.
this
limit
does
exist
and
then
to
see
that
requires
some
,
some
algebraic
computation
.
so
,
we
manage
to
evaluate
that
limit
.
the
limit
was
one
,
but
no
thanks
to
l'hopital
.
the
limit
of
the
ratio
of
the
derivatives
did
n't
exist
,
it
was
oscillating
.
we
evaluated
that
limit
by
algebraic
manipulation
.
and
do
n't
get
me
wrong
.
l'hopital
is
awfully
powerful
.
there
's
plenty
of
situations
where
you
want
to
use
l'hopital
.
but
often
,
you
can
get
away
with
just
doing
some
algebraic
manipulation
.
so
,
i
encourage
you
,
when
you
're
doing
those
limit
problems
,
do
n't
forget
that
you
can
just
algebraically
manipulate
things
.
there
might
be
an
easier
way
than
bringing
out
l'hopital
.
only
use
l'hopital
if
you
absolutely
have
to
use
l'hopital
.
in
other
words
,
do
n't
fall
in
love
with
l'hopital
.
