1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,300
[music] There are plenty of limits that
are really quite hard to evaluate.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,278
Here's an example.
Take the limit as x approaches 4 of the

3
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:17,780
square root of x minus 2, divided by x
minus 4.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,221
Admittedly, that limit's not really that
difficult to calculate.

5
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,716
Alright?
The limit is 1 4th.

6
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:27,571
But we can also think about this, maybe a
little bit more intuitively.

7
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,091
Look at what's going on.
The limit of the numerator is 0, right?

8
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:35,336
As x approaches 4, the square root of a
number close to 4 minus 2 is close to 0.

9
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,686
And the limit of the denominator is also
0.

10
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:41,850
And because the limit of the denominator
is 0, I can't just use my limit of the

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,866
quotients as the quotient of limits deal
to evaluate this limit, right?

12
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:50,966
I'm genuinely in a difficult situation..
And the problem is that the numerator

13
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,862
being close to zero, is trying to make
this ratio small.

14
00:00:54,862 --> 00:01:00,772
But when the denominator is close to zero,
it's trying to make this ratio really big.

15
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:04,947
And neither the numerator nor the
denominator win the game.

16
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:08,159
Right?
Those 2 forces balance off, giving the

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,818
answer of 1 4th.
But why?

18
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:15,712
Well, we can see this geometrically.
So here I've graphed in green the function

19
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:18,826
squared of x minus 2.
That's the numerator.

20
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:22,801
And in orange I've graphed x minus 4.
Y equals x minus 4.

21
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:28,636
And you can see that when x is equal to 4,
these curves cross the x axis because when

22
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:32,908
I plug in 4 here, I get zero.
When I plug in 4 here, I get zero.

23
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:38,290
But also note that the green curve is
getting closer to zero more quickly than

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,618
the orange curve.
Let's replace those two functions with the

25
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:46,370
approximations that we get by using the
derivative.

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,250
Now, let me replace this green curve with
the tangent line to the green curve at the

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,711
point where the green curve crosses the
x-axis.

28
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:59,542
Well, here I go.
Here's a picture just of that tangent

29
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,850
line.
Now I could compute that tangent line by

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,746
doing a little bit of calculus.
Alright.

31
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:08,426
This function is the square root of x
minus 2.

32
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:12,976
If I differentiate that I get 1 over 2
square root sub x, that's the derivative

33
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:17,051
of the square root function.
And the derivative of minus 2 is just 0.

34
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:21,530
Now I can evaluate that derivative at 4,
and I get the derivative is 1 4th, and

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,786
that's the slope of the tangent line.
Here to the green curve.

36
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:30,806
Now I know that my tangent line should
cross through the point 4, 0.

37
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:36,752
So here's equation that tangent line in
point slope form and I can rewrite this a

38
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:41,035
little bit more nicely as y equals a
quarter of x minus 1.

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,996
So what happens to the limit problem when
we replace those expressions by their

40
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:49,060
tangent lines?
So instead of thinking about this

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,018
geometrically, I can just look back at
this original limit problem, and replace

42
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:58,932
these pieces by their tangent lines.
And we calculated the tangent line to the

43
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:03,957
graph of the square root of x minus 2.
To be one quarter times x minus 4, and the

44
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:08,568
denominator is already a straight line.
So, if I replace the numerator and

45
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:13,032
denominator by the straight line
approximations that are good for inputs

46
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:17,733
near 4, this original limit problem is
transformed into this limit problem.

47
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,805
But this limit problem is really easy to
do, right?

48
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:25,700
I've got an x minus 4 in the numerator and
an x minus 4 in the denominator.

49
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:30,125
So this limit is 1 quarter.
It's important to emphasize that we really

50
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:34,590
haven't done anything new here.
We could have calculated this limit even

51
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,630
without thinking about derivatives and
tangent lines, but this perspective opens

52
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,653
up a new way of approaching some limit
problems.

53
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:47,452
So here's how I can package this up.
Into a situation that's maybe useful more

54
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:50,314
generally.
Suppose I got two functions, I got a

55
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,175
function f and a function g.
And let's suppose the limit of f as x

56
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:58,135
approaches a is 0 and the limit of g of x
as x approaches a is also 0.

57
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:02,749
And just for kicks, let's suppose that f
and g are also differentiable, twice

58
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:06,963
differentiable, you know, I want these to
be really nice functions.

59
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:10,838
Now let's suppose I want to try to
calculate the limit of f of x over g of x,

60
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,539
as x approaches a.
This might be a difficult limit to

61
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,168
calculate.
But what we just saw is that we could try

62
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,260
to understand this a little bit better by
replacing f and g by their tangent line

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,819
approximations.
Another way to say that Is I'm just going

64
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,875
to replace f of x and g of x by their
approximations that I get from considering

65
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:33,236
their derivative, right?
So, the limit of f of x over g of x should

66
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:36,951
be close to this because f of x is close
to this, right?

67
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:41,605
It's the value of f at a plus the
derivative of f at a times how much the

68
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,901
input changes when I go from a to x.
That's approximately f of x.

69
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,851
And this denominator should be about g of
x.

70
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:53,999
It's g of a plus the derivative of g at a
times x minus a, that's about g of x.

71
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:59,309
So if you believe that the numerator and
denominator here are approximately f of x

72
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:03,630
and g of x, you might then believe that
these limits are also equal.

73
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,238
But this is a really great situation to be
in because f of a say is equal to 0 if f

74
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:12,012
is continuous there, maybe since it's
differentiable.

75
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,242
And g of a is also equal to 0 since g is
continuous.

76
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,173
So that these f of a and g of a terms go
away.

77
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:22,911
And then I've got an x minus a and an x
minus a term there, so those also cancel,

78
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:26,691
and all I'm left with is just f prime of a
divided by g prime of a.

79
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:31,113
So it seems like if you try to calculate
the limit of this ratio, what's really

80
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:35,874
relevant is understanding something about
the derivatives of your numerator and

81
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,886
denominator separately.
At that point a.

82
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:43,361
The precise statement of this is usually
called L'Hopital's rule.

83
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:48,809
So here's a statement of L'Hopital's rule.
Suppose I got two functions f and g and

84
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:54,303
they're differentiable for inputs near a,
and the limit of f of x and the limit of g

85
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:59,190
of x as x approaches a are both 0.
So these functions output is very small

86
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,834
when their input is close to a.
And the limit of the derivative of f

87
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:08,395
divided by the derivative of g as x
approaches a, just exists.

88
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:14,203
And the derivative of g is not 0, when I
evaluate that derivative for inputs near

89
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:17,469
a.
If all of these conditions are true, then

90
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,253
I get the fantastic conclusion that the
limit of f of x over g of x.

91
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:26,360
Is the limit of the derivative of f over
the derivative of g?

92
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,548
And the hope is that this limit is easier
to compute then the original limit.

93
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:35,648
Let's try to use L'Hopital's rule in a
much trickier context.

94
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:41,158
So here's an example, let's compute the
limit as x approaches zero of cosine x

95
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,239
minus one minus x quote over two all over
x 2 the 4th power.

96
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,324
Now we can do it using L'Hopital's rule.
So the limit of the numerator is zero and

97
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:55,002
the limit of the denominator is zero.
And these are really nice functions, so

98
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,838
they're nice enough for us to apply
L'Hopital.

99
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:02,589
So I should calculate the limit of the
derivative of the numerator, divided by

100
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,904
the derivative of the denominator and that
might help me compute this original limit.

101
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:11,299
So here we go.
The derivative of the numerator is minus

102
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:16,401
sign x, that's the derivative cosine.
Minus zero, that's the derivative of 1.

103
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,605
Minus x, that's the derivative of x
squared over 2.

104
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,809
Divided by, what's the derivative of x to
the 4th?

105
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,472
It's 4x cubed.
Now here, I'm in a situation where the

106
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:31,392
limit of the numerator is 0, because the
limit of sin x as x approaches 0 is 0 and

107
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:36,289
the limit of x as x approaches 0 is 0.
So, the limit of the numerator is 0 and

108
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,142
the limit of the denominator is also 0.
So here's the funny thing.

109
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:46,332
I could try to apply L'Hopital again to
understand this limit.

110
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,486
So here we go.
I'll use L'Hopital again.

111
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:54,237
I'll differentiate the numerator.
The derivative of minus sin is minus

112
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:57,252
cosine.
And the derivative of x is 1.

113
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:02,065
So this is minus cosine of x minus 1.
Divided by the derivative of the

114
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,771
denominator which is 4 times 3x squared,
or 12x squared.

115
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:12,109
Now what kind of situation am I in here?
Well here, the numerator has limit 0

116
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,634
because cosine's limit is 1 and it's
attracting 1.

117
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:20,899
And the limit of the denominator is also
0, so I'm again in a situation where the

118
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,262
numerator and denominator are heading
toward 0.

119
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:28,883
So to understand this, I could again use
L'Hopital to look at how quickly these

120
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,342
terms are dying.
So I apply L'Hopital again, and L'Hopital

121
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:35,354
tells me to look at the derivative of the
numerator.

122
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,243
The derivative of minus cosine of x, is
sine x.

123
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:43,645
Minus 1, well that's just 0, divided by
the limit of the denominator.

124
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:47,437
Well, what's the derivative of the
denominator?

125
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:51,275
It's 24x.
So now I'm again in a situation where the

126
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,748
numerator and the denominator have limit
0.

127
00:08:54,748 --> 00:09:00,985
So I could again apply L'Hopital, and it
would tell me to look at the derivative of

128
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:05,343
the numerator over the derivative of the
denominator.

129
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:11,162
The derivative of the numerator is cosine
x and the derivative of the denominator is

130
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,295
24.
But now look, the numerator has limit 1,

131
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:18,275
and the denominator has limit 24, it's
just a constant.

132
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:23,351
So this is a limit of the quotient and the
quotient of limit, so this limit is, Is 1

133
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,236
24th.
Now, L'Hopital then tells me that this

134
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:30,056
limit being equal to 1 24th makes this
limit equal to 1 24th.

135
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:35,002
And because this limit exists, it then
tells me that this limit is also equal to

136
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:38,192
1 24th.
And because this limit then exists it then

137
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,901
tells me that this limit is equal to 1
24th.

138
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:54,876
And then because this limit exists it
tells me that the original limit is 1

139
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,022
24th.
