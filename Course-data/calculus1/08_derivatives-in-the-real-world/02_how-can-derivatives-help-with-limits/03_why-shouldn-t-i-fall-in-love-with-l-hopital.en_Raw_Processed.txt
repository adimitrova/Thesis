music people often this idea that 
lhopitals rule is really great 
im going to tell you you shouldnt 
fall in love lhopitals rule 
one thing, lhopitals rule often 
leads to circular reasoning 
lets go to blackboard take a 
look 
example, 
heres a problem that you might 
tempted to use lhopital 
you know, in a limit x approaches zero 
sine x x 
now, you to check 
well, lets take a look limit 
numerator 
limit sine x x approaches zero, 
sine is continuous so that limit is 
sine zero, is zero 
numerators limit is zero 
limit denominator 
limit x x approaches zero is 
zero 
so, yeah 
this is a zero zero indeterminate 
form 
so, we tried using lhopital 
lhopital tells us that this limit is 
equal to limit x approaches zero 
derivative numerator, 
is cosine x derivative 
denominator, is one 
now, this limit is quite a bit easier to 
do, right 
this is really limit cosin x 
x approaches zero 
cosine is continuous so this is 
value cosine zero, is one 
yeah, 
i mean, limit sine x x x 
approaches zero, 
is, in fact, one 
this looks good, 
alright 
the, question though is you 
know that derivative sine x 
cosine x 
you needed to know that in order to apply 
lhopital 
you know derivative sine x 
cosine x 
well, lets think back 
right 
so, i know that derivative 
sine x cosine x 
well, taking a derivative is 
thing a limit a difference 
quotient 
so, to calculate, say, derivative 
sine zero, i take a limit like this 
limit if h goes to zero sine h 
sine h 
sine zero is zero 
so, calculating this limit, is 
calculating derivative sine , 
is really calculating 
limit h goes to zero, 
sine h, thats sign h h 
now, happened 
i wanted to calculate derivative 
sine zero, to calculate 
derivative sine zero, is really 
calculating limit h goes 
to zero sine h h 
definition derivative 
i going to use this to evaluate 
limit sine x x using 
lhopital, 
right lhopital doesnt reduce a 
limit problem to another limit 
problem 
reduces a limit problem to a 
limit problem two derivative 
problems, 
right 
to, to lhopital, you to able 
to differentiate numerator 
denominator 
so, if youre going to use lhopital to 
evaluate sine x x x goes to zero, 
youre going to to differentiate 
sine x 
then, to differentiate sin x zero, 
is youre trying to do, to, to 
use lhopital, you to able to 
evaluate this limit, limit sine h 
h 
you to able to limit 
youre trying to already 
circular reasoning 
so, happened 
i trying to calculate limit 
sine x x x approaches zero 
i used lhopital 
lhopita told to differentiate sine x 
then, to differentiate sine x, i 
wouldve needed to able to evaluate 
limit sine h h h goes to 
zero, exact problem im trying to 
solve 
an example circular reasoning 
theres things that go wrong 
lhopital 
one conditions lhopital is 
that limit ratio 
derivatives to exist 
lets see an example that fails to 
happen 
heres an example 
lets take a look limit x plus 
sine x x x approaches infinity 
try to use lhopital 
so, i want to look limit 
numerator 
limit x plus sine x x 
approaches infinity is infinity 
limit denominator itself, 
limit x x approaches infinity, 
also infinity 
this is an infinity infinity 
indeterminate form 
seems good 
now, lhopitals tells that to 
calculate this, i look 
limit x approaches infinity 
derivative numerator, is 
one plus cosine x derivative 
denominator, is one 
now, whats limit one plus cosine 
x x approaches infinity 
well, limit one is one 
whats limit cosine x x 
approaches infinity, 
right 
cosine oscillates between 
this limit doesnt exist 
this limit doesnt exist 
now, that mean that this limit 
doesnt exist 
i, i, i wrote equals here, remember, 
im using lhopitals rule, 
alright 
lhopitals rule actually 
say 
says, that this limit is equal to 
limit derivative 
derivative, provided this limit exists 
this limit doesnt exist in this 
case 
so, lhopital is silent to value 
this limit 
lets see if we actually compute that 
limit way 
alright 
so, lets try to this limit 
way 
going to limit x plus 
sine x x goes to infinity without 
using lhopital 
this is a limit fraction, we could 
split fraction a limit x 
goes to infinity x x plus sine x 
x 
now, thats a limit a sum, is 
sum limits provided limits 
exist 
so, this is limit x goes to 
infinity x x plus limit x 
goes to infinity sine x x 
now, whats limit x x x goes 
to infinity 
one 
whats limit sine x x x 
goes to infinity 
well, sine x is always between 
x here is going to infinity 
i make x big i like 
so, question is i make this close 
to zero i like 
yeah 
making x large enough, a number 
between x made close 
to zero i like 
so, this limit is zero 
sound so, sum limits is one 
sound thats limit sum 
thats limit x plus sine x x 
one x goes to infinity 
this is true in spite fact 
that lhopital failed us, right 
we lhopitals in this problem, 
i told to differentiate 
numerator, divided derivative 
denominator x goes to infinity, 
that derivative didnt exist 
oscillating between zero two 
in that case, lhopital is 
silent 
lhopital requires that limit 
ratio derivatives to exist, if 
doesnt exist, lhopital doesnt say 
anything 
this limit exist to see 
that requires some, algebraic 
computation 
so, we manage to evaluate that limit 
limit one, thanks to 
lhopital 
limit ratio derivatives 
didnt exist, 
oscillating 
we evaluated that limit algebraic 
manipulation 
dont get wrong 
lhopital is awfully powerful 
theres plenty situations you 
want to use lhopital often, you 
get away algebraic 
manipulation 
so, i encourage you, youre 
limit problems, 
dont forget that you 
algebraically manipulate things 
there might an easier way 
bringing lhopital 
use lhopital if you absolutely 
to use lhopital 
in words, dont fall in love 
lhopital
