1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,200
[music].
Let's pretend that you're a shepherd and

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,585
you want to build a fence for your sheep.
Specifically, let's say that you've got 52

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:14,299
meters of fencing.
And you're committed to building a

4
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,216
rectangular pen for your sheep next to
your barn.

5
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:20,927
So how big of a sheep pen can you build
with that much fencing?

6
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:29,547
Process is a standard one, it's got five
steps.

7
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:33,693
The first thing I'm going to do is to draw
a picture of the situation.

8
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:37,791
With a picture in hand and everything
labelled with variables.

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,691
I can write down the thing I'm tying to
optimize, the goal.

10
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:45,349
With that, I can also write down the
constraints, right?

11
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:48,808
Not every combination of variables maybe
make sense.

12
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,541
Maybe some domain issues to consider as
well.

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,480
Then in step four, I'm going to solve my
goal for a single variable.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,485
And once I get a function of a single
variable, I can apply calculus.

15
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,261
Right?
This last step really means to say

16
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:08,071
differentiate the function of a single
variable, find the critical points, figure

17
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,376
out where the largest and smallest values
are.

18
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:15,567
That's my five-step process.
First, I draw a picture, so let's

19
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,625
rearrange this in a slightly nicer
picture.

20
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:24,930
I'll build my little sheep pen here.
Here's my rectangular pen for my sheep

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,903
that I built next to my barn.
And I'd better label the side lengths

22
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:34,760
here.
The top and bottom will be x meters long

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,850
and this side here will be y meters long.
Now, what is it that I'm trying to

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,011
maximize?
Well, I want the fenced in area here to be

25
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:50,133
as big as possible.
So the thing I'm trying to maximize is the

26
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,856
area of this pen and that area is x times
y.

27
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:59,131
Now at this point, you probably think,
well I know how to maximize that function.

28
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,175
I'll just pick x and y to be absolutely
enormous.

29
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:07,557
And if an enormous number is multiplied by
an enormous number, if I multiply x times

30
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:12,168
y, the output will be enormous.
Right, I'll build a sheep pen the size of

31
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:15,355
the Milky Way.
But there's a constraint.

32
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:21,341
Yeah, I mean, I can't simply build this
fence as big as I like, because I've only

33
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,668
got 52 meters of yellow fence to begin
with.

34
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:30,869
So the constraint is that the length of
this fence, which is 2x plus y is 52.

35
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:35,726
I'm saying equal 52, because I might as
well use all of the fence that I have to

36
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:39,443
build this sheep pen.
Another way to say that, is that this is

37
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,206
what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to maximize this quantity, the

38
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,953
area of the pen, subject to the constraint
that 2x plus y, the length of fence in my

39
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,483
pane is 52 meters and I should say that x
and y are nonnegative quantities.

40
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:58,900
It doesn't make any sense to make one side
of my sheet pane negative.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,538
Now, I use to constraint to solve the
thing I'm trying to optimize for a single

42
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,657
variable.
Okay.

43
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:09,023
So I'm going to solve this for a single
variable.

44
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:15,544
I've got that 2x plus y is 52, so I could
solve for y, y is 52 minus 2x.

45
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:23,238
The quantity that I'm trying to maximize
is x times y, but if y is 52 minus 2x,

46
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:31,298
then, I'm really trying to maximize x
times 52 minus 2x, because this quantity

47
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,220
is y.
So this Is the function of a single

48
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,196
variable that I'm trying to maximize.
Okay, fantastic.

49
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:42,446
Now, I've got a function of one variable
so I can apply calculus.

50
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:46,946
I can differentiate this thing and search
for the critical points.

51
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:52,042
So let's call this a function f.
So f of x is x times 52 minus 2 x, that

52
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:57,680
dot is multiplication.
I could distribute this and write f is 52

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,022
times x minus 2 x squared.
Now, I can calculate the derivative, the

54
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:08,786
derivative of f is the derivative of 52x
minus the derivative of 2x squared.

55
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:13,162
The derivative of 52x is just 52.
The derivative of 2x squared is 4x.

56
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:18,098
So, the derivative of f is 52 minus 4x.
The critical points are places where the

57
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:22,712
function's derivative vanishes or the
function is not differentiable.

58
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:26,842
This function is polynomial, so it's
differentiable everywhere.

59
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:31,622
The only thing I have to worry about then,
for critical points, is when this

60
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:36,304
derivative is equal to zero.
So for what values of x is that equal to

61
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:39,687
zero?
Well, the only place where this derivative

62
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:45,161
is equal to zero is when x equals 13.
I should also remember that I'm maximizing

63
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:51,044
this function subject to this constraint
and there were also some domain issues.

64
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:56,508
I don't want x to be negative.
And, in order to ensure that y is

65
00:04:56,508 --> 00:05:04,373
nonnegative, if 2x plus y is 52, then x
can't be negative, but x also can't be

66
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:09,121
bigger than 26.
So, what's the situation here?

67
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:14,306
Well, I can summarize it.
My critical points.

68
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:19,922
Well, there's really only one critical
point and the critical point is when x is

69
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:23,881
equal to 13.
Then I've also got some endpoints, right?

70
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:29,446
The endpoints to consider are when x is
equal to 0 or when x is equal to 26.

71
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:34,324
So these are the three points to check.
Now, I just have to figure out which of

72
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:37,331
these values results in the best fence.
All right.

73
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:41,867
So these are the three points that I
should check, so I'll make a little table

74
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,847
here.
The x values that I'll check are 0, 26,

75
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:48,439
and 13.
And I'll figure out what the corresponding

76
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,513
y value is and then I'll figure out x
times y, which will be the area of the

77
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:58,171
fenced in region if I use these as my side
lengths for my sheep pen.

78
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:03,070
So, let's see.
If x is equal to 0 and I satisfy this

79
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:10,004
constraint that 2x plus y is 52.
If x is equal to zero, then y must be 52.

80
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:14,832
And if x is 26, then 2 times 26 plus what
gives me 52.

81
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:20,844
Well, then y is equal to 0.
And if x is 13, then 2 times 13 is 26,

82
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:24,964
plus what gives me 52?
Well, then y must be 26.

83
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:31,966
Now, in each of these three cases, I can
figure out what the area of the resulting

84
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:36,900
sheep pen would be.
0 times 52 is just 0 and 26 times 0 is

85
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,810
also 0.
13 times 26 is 338.

86
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,175
So here, this is the best choice for my
sheep pen.

87
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:50,879
This isn't just a great calculation.
I hope that, intuitively, this method

88
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,955
really makes sense.
I mean, look, if x is equal to 0, that

89
00:06:55,955 --> 00:07:03,203
means I'm building my sheep pen just
entirely up against the side of the barn.

90
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:07,941
And if y equals 0, well, that means I'm
building my sheep pen like this.

91
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,885
I'm just building fence that goes over and
then fence that comes right back.

92
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,760
Again, there's no area that this so-called
pen is enclosing.

93
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,373
That x equals 13 and y equals 26 is the
best choice for our sheep is clear if you

94
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:27,248
think about how wiggling x would affect
the area of the sheep pen.

95
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:32,122
So here is the best solution, right, to
have x be 13 and y be 26.

96
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:36,863
What if I were to push this fence in just
a little bit, all right?

97
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:42,966
I'd make the x values a little bit smaller
and then make the y value a little bit

98
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:47,059
bigger to compensate, right?
Maybe x is 12 and y is 28.

99
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,163
Why is this worse?
Well, think about what happens when I

100
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:57,308
change from x equals 13 to x equals 12.
I give up this region here and that's 26

101
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:03,957
square meters of fenced in region.
I gain this region up here and this region

102
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:10,383
up here, but this region up here is 12
square meters and this region here is 12

103
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:15,161
square meters.
So I'm giving up 26 square meters to gain

104
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,356
24 square meters.
That's a bad deal.

105
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,986
This is really the whole crux of the
matter.

106
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:23,532
Right?
When you found the best thing, small

107
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:26,361
changes to the best thing, don't make it
better.

108
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:30,911
But if you hadn't found the best thing,
then you could make a small change that

109
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,041
would make it better.
That's the whole idea, right?

110
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:46,743
That understanding how functions change
can be used to understand the best output

111
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,213
for a function.
