why
do
critical
points
have
to
include
places
where
the
function
fails
to
be
differentiable
?
here
's
a
specific
example
that
we
can
work
through
to
see
why
it
's
necessary
to
check
points
of
non-differentiability
.
you
'll
notice
that
i
've
included
some
absolute
value
brackets
to
introduce
some
non-differentiability
,
okay
?
anyway
,
here
's
the
problem
.
find
maximum
and
minimum
values
of
this
function
.
x
minus
the
absolute
value
of
x
squared
minus
2
x
,
and
do
it
on
the
interval
between
0
and
3.
well
,
how
do
i
proceed
?
let
's
differentiate
,
okay
?
so
,
i
differentiate
f
prime
is
,
well
,
the
derivative
of
x
is
1
minus
the
derivative
.
okay
,
whoa
,
wait
,
what
am
i
going
to
do
about
differentiating
this
absolute
value
?
i
can
rewrite
this
function
as
a
piece
wise
function
,
getting
rid
of
the
absolute
value
.
so
,
here
's
the
original
function
where
i
got
an
absolute
value
,
and
remember
what
absolute
value
does
.
absolute
value
negates
this
input
if
the
input
's
negative
,
right
?
so
,
the
absolute
value
guarantees
that
it
's
output
is
positive
with
the
same
magnitude
as
the
original
input
.
so
all
i
've
got
to
do
to
rewrite
f
as
a
piece-wise
function
is
to
deal
with
that
,
right
?
i
've
just
got
to
make
sure
that
if
this
input
is
negative
,
then
i
better
flip
the
sign
,
the
sign
of
the
absolute
value
.
now
,
i
want
to
know
the
derivative
of
this
function
and
i
can
compute
that
by
just
differentiating
each
piece
in
my
piece-wise
define
function
.
so
,
here
i
go
.
i
'm
going
to
differentiate
these
two
pieces
separately
.
so
,
the
derivative
of
f
is
also
now
a
piece-wise
function
and
i
should
differentiate
this
.
the
derivative
of
x
is
1
minus
the
derivative
of
this
which
is
2
x
,
that
's
the
derivative
of
x
squared
,
and
the
derivative
of
2
x
is
just
2.
and
this
is
if
x
squared
minus
2
x.
so
,
bigger
than
zero
.
and
the
derivative
of
this
is
1
plus
the
derivative
of
this
,
which
is
2
x
minus
2.
and
this
is
if
x
squared
minus
2
x
is
less
than
zero
.
and
you
'll
notice
that
i
'm
careful
to
change
the
greater
than
or
equal
to
here
to
just
greater
than
.
and
the
reason
is
because
this
derivative
is
not
going
to
be
defined
when
this
quantity
is
equal
to
0.
now
,
it
is
time
to
hunt
for
critical
points
.
so
,
to
simplify
our
hunt
for
the
critical
points
,
i
can
rewrite
f
prime
a
little
bit
to
make
it
a
little
bit
easier
to
see
what
's
going
on
.
so
,
what
can
we
do
here
?
well
,
1
minus
2
x
minus
2
,
that
's
the
same
thing
as
three
minus
2
x
and
1
plus
2
x
minus
2.
that
's
the
same
thing
as
minus
1
plus
2
x.
alright
,
and
then
i
can
rewrite
this
x
squared
minus
2
x
greater
than
0
,
and
x
squared
minus
2
x
less
than
0.
to
say
that
x
squared
minus
2
x
is
bigger
than
0
is
the
same
as
saying
that
x
is
less
than
0
,
or
x
is
bigger
than
2
,
and
to
say
that
this
is
less
than
0
is
just
to
say
that
x
is
trapped
between
0
and
2.
alright
,
now
that
i
've
got
this
nicer
way
of
writing
the
derivative
i
can
very
visibly
see
that
something
terrible
is
happening
when
,
when
x
is
equal
to
2.
because
if
this
thing
were
differentiable
there
,
you
'd
expect
this
quantity
and
this
quantity
to
agree
when
x
equals
2.
but
these
things
disagree
when
x
is
equal
to
2
,
alright
?
so
,
this
function
ends
up
not
being
differentiable
at
2.
where
is
this
thing
equal
to
zero
?
well
,
3
minus
2x
would
vanish
if
x
were
3
halves
.
but
3
halves
does
n't
satisfy
this
.
so
,
this
first
thing
never
results
in
a
critical
point
where
the
derivative
vanishes
.
what
about
this
?
what
about
minus
1
plus
2
x
?
well
,
this
is
equal
to
0
if
x
is
equal
to
a
half
.
and
that
is
in
this
region
.
so
here
,
what
we
know
the
derivative
is
equal
to
0
if
x
is
equal
to
a
half
and
the
function
's
not
differentiable
when
x
is
equal
to
2.
well
,
a
function
's
also
not
differentiable
when
x
is
equal
to
zero
.
but
remember
,
the
end
points
of
our
interval
that
we
're
considering
are
0
and
so
,
if
you
like
,
you
can
include
0
as
a
point
of
non-differentiability
.
but
,
it
's
in
this
list
of
end
points
so
we
're
going
to
have
to
consider
it
anyhow
.
note
that
there
's
something
really
special
in
this
particular
example
.
i
really
want
to
emphasize
that
2
is
a
critical
point
not
because
the
derivative
is
equal
to
0
,
but
because
the
function
is
not
differentiable
at
the
.2.
so
,
to
finish
off
this
problem
,
to
find
the
minimum
and
maximum
values
of
my
function
f
,
all
i
have
to
do
is
check
the
critical
points
and
the
endpoints
.
so
,
here
's
our
endpoints
,
0
and
3
,
a
place
where
the
derivative
vanishes
when
x
is
equal
to
1
half
and
a
place
where
the
derivative
is
not
defined
when
x
is
equal
to
2.
and
where
were
the
original
function
is
?
alright
,
f
of
x
is
x
minus
the
absolute
value
of
x
squared
minus
2
x.
so
,
what
do
we
get
when
i
plug
in
0
?
i
just
get
0.
and
when
i
plug
in
3
,
i
also
get
0
,
right
?
3
minus
,
well
,
3
squared
is
9
minus
2
times
3
,
that
's
9
minus
3
,
that
's
3
.
3
minus
3
is
also
0.
when
i
plug
in
1
half
,
i
get
minus
a
quarter
.
and
when
i
plug
in
2
,
i
get
2.
so
,
i
've
got
my
table
.
where
is
the
maximum
and
where
is
the
minimum
?
so
,
the
minimum
value
is
here
,
when
x
is
equal
to
1
half
,
the
functions
minimum
value
is
minus
quarter
.
and
the
maximum
value
is
when
x
is
equal
to
2
,
the
function
's
output
is
2.
had
i
not
been
careful
to
include
x
equals
2
,
the
point
where
the
function
fails
to
be
differentiable
,
.
i
would
have
totally
missed
out
on
finding
the
maximum
value
of
this
function
.
it
's
really
easy
to
see
why
this
is
so
important
by
taking
a
look
at
a
graph
.
we
'll
use
the
graph
of
this
function
x
minus
absolute
value
of
x
squared
minus
2
x
on
the
intervals
0
to
3.
and
you
can
see
the
minimum
value
occurs
when
x
is
equal
to
1
half
and
the
maximum
value
occurs
when
x
is
equal
to
2.
and
that
point
really
is
a
place
where
the
function
's
not
differentiable
.
i
mean
,
that
's
exactly
why
i
see
a
corner
there
.
the
upshot
here
is
that
a
point
of
non-differentiability
,
a
place
where
the
function
fails
to
be
differentiable
could
very
well
be
where
the
maximum
value
occurs
.
you
can
think
of
calculus
as
a
maximum
finding
machine
and
you
're
trying
to
find
those
maximum
values
.
so
,
if
calculus
fails
you
at
some
place
,
if
the
maximum
finding
machine
is
broken
for
some
particular
input
,
that
could
very
well
be
where
the
maximum
value
is
hiding
.
so
,
you
're
going
to
need
to
check
there
.
