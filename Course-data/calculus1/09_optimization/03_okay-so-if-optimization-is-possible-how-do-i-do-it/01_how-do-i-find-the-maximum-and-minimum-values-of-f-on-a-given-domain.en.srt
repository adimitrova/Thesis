1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,291
Provided some conditions are satisfied,
the Extreme Value Therom guarantees the

2
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:12,139
existence of maximum and minimum values.
But how am I supposed to find those

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,478
maximum and minimum values?
We've actually already done this in some

4
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:23,575
examples, but it's worth describing an
explicit process for finding maxima and

5
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,624
minima.
Here's a frour-step process.

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:31,303
First, differentiate your function Can
find all the critical points.

7
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:35,469
Those are places where the derivative is
equal to zero or the derivative isn't

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,128
defined.
And also lists the end points if they're

9
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,028
included in your domain.
Check those points, right?

10
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:45,658
Check the end points, check the critical
points, and potentially you also need to

11
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:49,575
check the limiting behavior if you're
working on an open Interval.

12
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:53,936
Let's work an example.
Okay, let's work an example.

13
00:00:53,937 --> 00:01:01,219
Let's look at the function, given by the
rule f of x equals 1 over, x squared minus

14
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,166
1.
This quantity squared.

15
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,497
But let's only consider this function on a
restricted domain.

16
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:13,635
Let's consider, a maximum, minimum values
of this function on the interval between

17
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:16,025
minus 1 and 1.
This open interval.

18
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:20,616
And now I differentiate.
Yeah, the first step is to differentiate

19
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:23,922
this function.
So before I differentiate it, I'm just

20
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,930
going to rewrite this.
Instead of 1 over x squared minus 1

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,161
squared, I'm going to write this as x
squared minus 1 to the negative 2nd power.

22
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:35,486
It's going to make it a little bit easier
for me when I think about the derivative.

23
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:41,053
So what's the derivative of this function?
By the power rule and the chain rule This

24
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:47,455
is negative 2 times the inside, x squared
minus 1 to the negative 3rd power times

25
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:53,954
the derivative of the inside which is 2x
or another way to write this is negative 2

26
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:59,889
times 2x, that's minus 4x divided by x
squared minus 1 to the third power.

27
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:03,114
With the derivative in hand, I can find
the critical points.

28
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:07,024
Yeah, the next step is to list the
critical points, and also the end points

29
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,959
if they're included.
So let's see.

30
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,446
What are the critical points of this
function?

31
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:16,492
Will those be places where the derivative
doesn't exist, or the derivative is equal

32
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,557
to zero.
Let's first think about when the

33
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,860
derivative is equal to zero.
Well, in order for that derivative to be

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,926
equal to zero, it's a fraction.
When's a fraction equal to zero?

35
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:28,005
Well, that occurred exactly when the
numerator is equal to zero.

36
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,766
So I'm really just asking when is minus 4x
equal to zero?

37
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:35,484
And that's just when x is equal to 0.
So the only time when the derivative is

38
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:40,093
equal to 0 is when x is equal to 0.
Now the derivative doesn't exist when x is

39
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:44,607
equal to 1 or when x is equal to minus 1
but, you know, the functions not even

40
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,737
defined in that case anyway.
And I'm only considering numbers between

41
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:51,583
minus 1 and 1 anyhow.
Don't have to worry about those.

42
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,863
And I don't have to worry about end
points.

43
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:57,838
Because, again, the interval that I'm
considering doesn't include the end

44
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,451
points, It's an open interval.
So I'm just going to check x equals zero

45
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:06,050
to figure out what's going on there.
So let's think about this point where x is

46
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,267
equal to zero.
Well the derivative at zero is equal to

47
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:12,023
zero.
If I just plug in zero into this I can see

48
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,907
that.
What's the derivative at a number between

49
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:18,365
minus 1 and zero?
Well if I plug in a number between minus 1

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,745
and zero, x squared is then between zero
and 1, so x squared minus 1 is now a

51
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:26,749
negative number cubed.
The denominator is negative, but this is a

52
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,154
negative number, negative 4 times a
negative number.

53
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:35,101
So we've got negative times negative
divided by negative, that's negative.

54
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:39,866
So the derivative at a number between
minus 1 and 0 is negative in this case.

55
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:44,672
And a similar kind of reasoning will show
that the derivative is positive if I

56
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:48,844
evaluate the derivative between 0 and 1.
So here is the deal.

57
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:53,484
I've got one critical point on this
interval between minus 1 and 1.

58
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:59,134
And the function's decreasing between
minus 1 and 0, and it's increasing between

59
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,530
0 and 1.
So what does that mean about the point 0?

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,080
Well it means that the point 0 must be a
place where the function achieves a local

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,817
minimum value.
So I can summarize that here, f of 0.

62
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:18,005
Is by, this is the first derivative test
is a local minimum value.

63
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:24,581
What about the end behavior?
What happens when x is near negative 1, or

64
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,602
when x is near 1?
So that's really step 4 in this checklist,

65
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,200
is to check the limiting or the end
behavior of this function.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,837
What do I mean by that?
I really mean look at this when X is just

67
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:39,669
a little bit bigger than minus Y, or X is
a little bit less than 1.

68
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,714
Alright, that's the end behavior of this
function.

69
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:46,664
These end points are actually included so
of course I can't evaluate the function

70
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:50,407
there but I should still see what happens
when X is close to these endpoints.

71
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,858
Let's imagine I was trying to draw a graph
of the function, alright.

72
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:58,338
How would I know from the derivative.
I know the function's decreasing here and

73
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:01,343
increasing here.
And I know the function's got a local

74
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,859
minimum value here, but linking to the
first derivative test.

75
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:07,757
So the function's going down and then it's
going up.

76
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:12,488
But what happens at these two Values, when
I get close to minus 1 and when I get

77
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:15,737
close to 1.
When I get close to minus 1, the function

78
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:20,677
is very, very large, and when I get close
to 1, on this side, the function's also

79
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:24,401
very, very large.
So if I imagined trying to draw a graph of

80
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,975
this function?
Right, it would be coming down like this,

81
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:32,302
flattening out and then it would be
getting very, very large again.

82
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:36,780
Let's summarize the situation.
This graph will help us summarize the

83
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,149
situation.
Alright, what do I know.

84
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:44,314
I know that F of 0 is the smallest output,
it's the minimum value that the function

85
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:47,722
achieves on the domain, open interval
minus 1 to 1.

86
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,254
And there's no maximum value.
By considering this limiting behavior, as

87
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:56,455
x approached to the endpoints which aren't
included in this domain.

88
00:05:56,455 --> 00:06:01,393
I can see that this function's output can
be made as positive as I'd like, right.

89
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:05,077
I can choose values of X to make the
output as big as I want.

90
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:10,265
So I can't say this function actually
achieves some maximum output value.

91
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,468
It doen'st achieve some maximum output
value.

92
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:17,208
But it does achieve a minimum output value
right here.

93
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,074
When x is equal to 0.
And that output is 1.

94
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:24,280
It's important to emphasize that the
domain truly matters.

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,307
Yeah, what if I ask to find the maximum
and minimum values of the same function f

96
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:36,404
of x is equal to one over x squared minus
one squared, but a different domain?What

97
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:41,591
if I looked on the interval from one to
infinity this open interval?

98
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:46,909
Again we start by differentiating Well of
course, the derivative's the same.

99
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,651
The derivative of this function is still
minus 4 x over x squared minus 1 to the

100
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,749
third power.
Now, where are the critical points?

101
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,236
The only place that this derivative is
equal to 0, is when x is equal to 0.

102
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:03,987
And the only place where the derivative
doesn't exist is just places where the

103
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:07,723
function isn't even defined, right?
So on this interval.

104
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:13,030
From one to infinity, there's no place
where the derivative isn't defined or is

105
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,093
equal to zero.
So there's no critical points.

106
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,335
So what about the behavior near the
boundaries of this interval?

107
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:25,381
What happens if X is just a little bit
more than one or when X is really, really

108
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,978
big?
So, we working on the interval from 1 to

109
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,604
infinity.
This open interval.

110
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:33,640
So, that means the limits that you'd
consider are the limits, the function as x

111
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,856
approaches infinity and the limit of the
function as x approaches 1 from the right

112
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,421
hand side.
And, doing calculation I find that the

113
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:44,079
limit of the function as x approaches
infinity is 0 because, in that case the

114
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,047
denominator can be made as large as I
like, which makes this ratio as close to 0

115
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,451
as I like.
And, the limit of the function as x

116
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,252
approaches 1 from the right is equal to
infinity.

117
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:58,187
Because in that case if x approaches 1
from the right this denominator can be

118
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,837
made as close to 0 and positive as I'd
like which makes this ratio as large as

119
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,734
I'd like.
So in this case this function on this

120
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:10,174
domain doesn't take a largest value and
doesn't take a smallest value.

121
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:14,968
The function's output can be made as big
as I'd like if I'm willing to choose x

122
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:19,908
just a little bit bigger than 1 and the
function's output can be made as close to

123
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,441
0 as I'd like if I'm willing to choose X
to be big enough.

124
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:28,267
In other words, the domain matters.
I mean this function, if I'm considering

125
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:33,217
the funciton on this domain, from -1 to 1.
It does have a smallest output value.

126
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:37,042
And it should use its local minimum value
when x is equal to 0.

127
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:42,142
But if consider the same function.
But on a different domain there's no

128
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:48,220
critical point on this domain, right?
And I studied the limiting behavior as x

129
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,986
approached one, and as x approached
infinity, and I found that I could make

130
00:08:53,986 --> 00:09:00,140
the output of this function as large as
I'd like and as close to zero as I'd like.

131
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,940
So this function doesn't achieve a maximum
minimum value on this interval.
