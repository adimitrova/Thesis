provided conditions satisfied, 
extreme value therom guarantees 
existence maximum minimum values 
i supposed to find 
maximum minimum values 
weve actually already done this in 
examples, worth describing an 
explicit process finding maxima 
minima 
heres a frourstep process 
first, differentiate function 
find critical points 
places derivative is 
equal to zero derivative isnt 
defined 
also lists end points if theyre 
included in domain 
check points, right 
check end points, check critical 
points, potentially you also need to 
check limiting behavior if youre 
working an open interval 
lets work an example 
okay, lets work an example 
lets look function, given 
rule f x equals over, x squared minus 
this quantity squared 
lets consider this function a 
restricted domain 
lets consider, a maximum, minimum values 
this function interval between 
minus 
this open interval 
i differentiate 
yeah, first step is to differentiate 
this function 
so i differentiate it, im 
going to rewrite this 
instead x squared minus 
squared, im going to write this x 
squared minus to negative nd power 
going to make a little bit easier 
i think derivative 
so whats derivative this function 
power rule chain rule this 
is negative times inside, x squared 
minus to negative rd power times 
derivative inside is x 
another way to write this is negative 
times x, thats minus x divided x 
squared minus to third power 
derivative in hand, i find 
critical points 
yeah, next step is to list 
critical points, also end points 
if theyre included 
so lets see 
critical points this 
function 
will places derivative 
doesnt exist, derivative is equal 
to zero 
lets first think 
derivative is equal to zero 
well, in order that derivative to 
equal to zero, a fraction 
whens a fraction equal to zero 
well, that occurred exactly 
numerator is equal to zero 
so im really asking is minus x 
equal to zero 
thats x is equal to 
so time derivative is 
equal to is x is equal to 
derivative doesnt exist x is 
equal to x is equal to minus 
but, you know, functions even 
defined in that case anyway 
im considering numbers between 
minus anyhow 
dont to worry 
i dont to worry end 
points 
because, again, interval that im 
considering doesnt include end 
points, an open interval 
so im going to check x equals zero 
to figure whats going there 
so lets think this point x is 
equal to zero 
well derivative zero is equal to 
zero 
if i plug in zero this i see 
that 
whats derivative a number between 
minus zero 
well if i plug in a number between minus 
zero, x squared is between zero 
, so x squared minus is a 
negative number cubed 
denominator is negative, this is a 
negative number, negative times a 
negative number 
so weve got negative times negative 
divided negative, thats negative 
so derivative a number between 
minus is negative in this case 
a similar kind reasoning will show 
that derivative is positive if i 
evaluate derivative between 
so here is deal 
ive got one critical point this 
interval between minus 
functions decreasing between 
minus , increasing between 

so that mean point 
well means that point must a 
place function achieves a local 
minimum value 
so i summarize that here, f 
is by, this is first derivative test 
is a local minimum value 
end behavior 
happens x is near negative , 
x is near 
so thats really step in this checklist, 
is to check limiting end 
behavior this function 
i mean that 
i really mean look this x is 
a little bit bigger minus y, x is 
a little bit less 
alright, thats end behavior this 
function 
end points actually included so 
course i cant evaluate function 
there i still see happens 
x is close to endpoints 
lets imagine i trying to draw a graph 
function, alright 
would i know derivative 
i know functions decreasing here 
increasing here 
i know functions got a local 
minimum value here, linking to 
first derivative test 
so functions going 
going 
happens two values, 
i get close to minus i get 
close to 
i get close to minus , function 
is very, large, i get close 
to , this side, functions also 
very, large 
so if i imagined trying to draw a graph 
this function 
right, would coming like this, 
flattening would 
getting very, large 
lets summarize situation 
this graph will help us summarize 
situation 
alright, i know 
i know that f is smallest output, 
minimum value that function 
achieves domain, open interval 
minus to 
theres maximum value 
considering this limiting behavior, 
x approached to endpoints arent 
included in this domain 
i see that this functions output 
made positive id like, right 
i choose values x to make 
output big i want 
so i cant say this function actually 
achieves maximum output value 
doenst achieve maximum output 
value 
achieve a minimum output value 
right here 
x is equal to 
that output is 
important to emphasize that 
domain truly matters 
yeah, if i ask to find maximum 
minimum values function f 
x is equal to one x squared minus 
one squared, a different domainwhat 
if i looked interval one to 
infinity this open interval 
we start differentiating well 
course, derivatives 
derivative this function is still 
minus x x squared minus to 
third power 
now, critical points 
place that this derivative is 
equal to , is x is equal to 
place derivative 
doesnt exist is places 
function isnt even defined, right 
so this interval 
one to infinity, theres place 
derivative isnt defined is 
equal to zero 
so theres critical points 
so behavior near 
boundaries this interval 
happens if x is a little bit 
one x is really, really 
big 
so, we working interval to 
infinity 
this open interval 
so, that means limits that youd 
consider limits, function x 
approaches infinity limit 
function x approaches right 
hand side 
and, calculation i find that 
limit function x approaches 
infinity is because, in that case 
denominator made large i 
like, makes this ratio close to 
i like 
and, limit function x 
approaches right is equal to 
infinity 
in that case if x approaches 
right this denominator 
made close to positive id 
like makes this ratio large 
id like 
so in this case this function this 
domain doesnt take a largest value 
doesnt take a smallest value 
functions output made big 
id like if im willing to choose x 
a little bit bigger 
functions output made close to 
id like if im willing to choose x 
to big enough 
in words, domain matters 
i mean this function, if im considering 
funciton this domain, to 
a smallest output value 
use local minimum value 
x is equal to 
if consider function 
a different domain theres 
critical point this domain, right 
i studied limiting behavior x 
approached one, x approached 
infinity, i found that i could make 
output this function large 
id like close to zero id like 
so this function doesnt achieve a maximum 
minimum value this interval
