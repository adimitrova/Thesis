lets pretend that youre a shepherd 
you want to build a fence sheep 
specifically, lets say that youve got 
meters fencing 
youre committed to building a 
rectangular pen sheep next to 
barn 
so big a sheep pen you build 
that much fencing 
process is a standard one, got five 
steps 
first thing im going to is to draw 
a picture situation 
a picture in hand everything 
labelled variables 
i write thing im tying to 
optimize, goal 
that, i also write 
constraints, right 
every combination variables maybe 
make sense 
maybe domain issues to consider 
well 
in step four, im going to solve 
goal a single variable 
i get a function a single 
variable, i apply calculus 
right 
this last step really means to say 
differentiate function a single 
variable, find critical points, figure 
largest smallest values 

thats fivestep process 
first, i draw a picture, so lets 
rearrange this in a slightly nicer 
picture 
ill build little sheep pen here 
heres rectangular pen sheep 
that i built next to barn 
id better label side lengths 
here 
top bottom will x meters long 
this side here will y meters long 
now, is that im trying to 
maximize 
well, i want fenced in area here to 
big possible 
so thing im trying to maximize is 
area this pen that area is x times 
y 
this point, you probably think, 
well i know to maximize that function 
ill pick x y to absolutely 
enormous 
if an enormous number is multiplied 
an enormous number, if i multiply x times 
y, output will enormous 
right, ill build a sheep pen size 
milky way 
theres a constraint 
yeah, i mean, i cant simply build this 
fence big i like, ive 
got meters yellow fence to begin 

so constraint is that length 
this fence, is x plus y is 
im saying equal , i might 
well use fence that i to 
build this sheep pen 
another way to say that, is that this is 
im trying to 
im trying to maximize this quantity, 
area pen, subject to constraint 
that x plus y, length fence in 
pane is meters i say that x 
y nonnegative quantities 
doesnt make sense to make one side 
sheet pane negative 
now, i use to constraint to solve 
thing im trying to optimize a single 
variable 
okay 
so im going to solve this a single 
variable 
ive got that x plus y is , so i could 
solve y, y is minus x 
quantity that im trying to maximize 
is x times y, if y is minus x, 
then, im really trying to maximize x 
times minus x, this quantity 
is y 
so this is function a single 
variable that im trying to maximize 
okay, fantastic 
now, ive got a function one variable 
so i apply calculus 
i differentiate this thing search 
critical points 
so lets call this a function f 
so f x is x times minus x, that 
dot is multiplication 
i could distribute this write f is 
times x minus x squared 
now, i calculate derivative, 
derivative f is derivative x 
minus derivative x squared 
derivative x is 
derivative x squared is x 
so, derivative f is minus x 
critical points places 
functions derivative vanishes 
function is differentiable 
this function is polynomial, so 
differentiable everywhere 
thing i to worry then, 
critical points, is this 
derivative is equal to zero 
so values x is that equal to 
zero 
well, place this derivative 
is equal to zero is x equals 
i also remember that im maximizing 
this function subject to this constraint 
there also domain issues 
i dont want x to negative 
and, in order to ensure that y is 
nonnegative, if x plus y is , x 
cant negative, x also cant 
bigger 
so, whats situation here 
well, i summarize 
critical points 
well, theres really one critical 
point critical point is x is 
equal to 
ive also got endpoints, right 
endpoints to consider x is 
equal to x is equal to 
so three points to check 
now, i to figure 
values results in best fence 
right 
so three points that i 
check, so ill make a little table 
here 
x values that ill check , , 

ill figure corresponding 
y value is ill figure x 
times y, will area 
fenced in region if i use side 
lengths sheep pen 
so, lets see 
if x is equal to i satisfy this 
constraint that x plus y is 
if x is equal to zero, y must 
if x is , times plus 
gives 
well, y is equal to 
if x is , times is , 
plus gives 
well, y must 
now, in three cases, i 
figure area resulting 
sheep pen would 
times is times is 
also 
times is 
so here, this is best choice 
sheep pen 
this isnt a great calculation 
i hope that, intuitively, this method 
really makes sense 
i mean, look, if x is equal to , that 
means im building sheep pen 
entirely side barn 
if y equals , well, that means im 
building sheep pen like this 
im building fence that goes 
fence that comes right back 
again, theres area that this socalled 
pen is enclosing 
that x equals y equals is 
best choice sheep is clear if you 
think wiggling x would affect 
area sheep pen 
so here is best solution, right, to 
x y 
if i to push this fence in 
a little bit, right 
id make x values a little bit smaller 
make y value a little bit 
bigger to compensate, right 
maybe x is y is 
is this worse 
well, think happens i 
change x equals to x equals 
i give this region here thats 
square meters fenced in region 
i gain this region here this region 
here, this region here is 
square meters this region here is 
square meters 
so im giving square meters to gain 
square meters 
thats a bad deal 
this is really whole crux 
matter 
right 
you found best thing, small 
changes to best thing, dont make 
better 
if you hadnt found best thing, 
you could make a small change that 
would make better 
thats whole idea, right 
that understanding functions change 
used to understand best output 
a function
