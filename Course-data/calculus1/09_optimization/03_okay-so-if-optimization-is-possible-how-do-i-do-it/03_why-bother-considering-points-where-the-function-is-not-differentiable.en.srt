[music] Why do critical points have to
include places where the function fails to

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:09,833
be differentiable?
Here's a specific example that we can work

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:15,142
through to see why it's necessary to check
points of non-differentiability.

4
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:20,248
You'll notice that I've included some
absolute value brackets to introduce some

5
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:24,888
non-differentiability, okay?
Anyway, here's the problem.

6
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:28,389
Find maximum and minimum values of this
function.

7
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:33,675
X minus the absolute value of x squared
minus 2 x, and do it on the interval

8
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,524
between 0 and 3.
Well, how do I proceed?

9
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:41,215
Let's differentiate, okay?
So, I differentiate f prime is, well, the

10
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:46,968
derivative of x is 1 minus the derivative.
Okay, whoa, wait, what am I going to do

11
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:52,712
about differentiating this absolute value?
I can rewrite this function as a piece

12
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:56,271
wise function, getting rid of the absolute
value.

13
00:00:56,271 --> 00:01:00,110
So, here's the original function where I
got an absolute value, and remember what

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,176
absolute value does.
Absolute value negates this input if the

15
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:06,353
input's negative, right?
So, the absolute value guarantees that

16
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:09,770
it's output is positive with the same
magnitude as the original input.

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,582
So all I've got to do to rewrite f as a
piece-wise function is to deal with that,

18
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:17,586
right?
I've just got to make sure that if this

19
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:22,835
input is negative, then I better flip the
sign, the sign of the absolute value.

20
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:27,593
Now, I want to know the derivative of this
function and I can compute that by just

21
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:31,451
differentiating each piece in my
piece-wise define function.

22
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:34,938
So, here I go.
I'm going to differentiate these two

23
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:38,789
pieces separately.
So, the derivative of f is also now a

24
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,685
piece-wise function and I should
differentiate this.

25
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:47,824
The derivative of x is 1 minus the
derivative of this which is 2 x, that's

26
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:52,488
the derivative of x squared, and the
derivative of 2 x is just 2.

27
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:57,100
And this is if x squared minus 2 x.
So, bigger than zero.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,815
And the derivative of this is 1 plus the
derivative of this, which is 2 x minus 2.

29
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:08,076
And this is if x squared minus 2 x is less
than zero.

30
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:14,546
And you'll notice that I'm careful to
change the greater than or equal to here

31
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:19,592
to just greater than.
And the reason is because this derivative

32
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:23,799
is not going to be defined when this
quantity is equal to 0.

33
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,954
Now, it is time to hunt for critical
points.

34
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:33,208
So, to simplify our hunt for the critical
points, I can rewrite f prime a little bit

35
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:37,050
to make it a little bit easier to see
what's going on.

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,454
So, what can we do here?
Well, 1 minus 2 x minus 2, that's the same

37
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,571
thing as three minus 2 x and 1 plus 2 x
minus 2.

38
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:53,530
That's the same thing as minus 1 plus 2 x.
Alright, and then I can rewrite this x

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,491
squared minus 2 x greater than 0, and x
squared minus 2 x less than 0.

40
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:05,841
To say that x squared minus 2 x is bigger
than 0 is the same as saying that x is

41
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:12,601
less than 0, or x is bigger than 2, and to
say that this is less than 0 is just to

42
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:19,049
say that x is trapped between 0 and 2.
Alright, now that I've got this nicer way

43
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,253
of writing the derivative I can very
visibly see that something terrible is

44
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:31,441
happening when, when x is equal to 2.
Because if this thing were differentiable

45
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:37,124
there, you'd expect this quantity and this
quantity to agree when x equals 2.

46
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:39,945
But these things disagree when x is equal
to 2, alright?

47
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:43,980
So, this function ends up not being
differentiable at 2.

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,714
Where is this thing equal to zero?
Well, 3 minus 2x would vanish if x were 3

49
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:52,946
halves.
But 3 halves doesn't satisfy this.

50
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:58,055
So, this first thing never results in a
critical point where the derivative

51
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,051
vanishes.
What about this?

52
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:04,862
What about minus 1 plus 2 x?
Well, this is equal to 0 if x is equal to

53
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,372
a half.
And that is in this region.

54
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:14,748
So here, what we know the derivative is
equal to 0 if x is equal to a half and the

55
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:19,581
function's not differentiable when x is
equal to 2.

56
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,743
Well, a function's also not differentiable
when x is equal to zero.

57
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:28,357
But remember, the end points of our
interval that we're considering are 0 and

58
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,699
3.
So, if you like, you can include 0 as a

59
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,244
point of non-differentiability.
But, it's in this list of end points so

60
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:40,747
we're going to have to consider it anyhow.
Note that there's something really special

61
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,581
in this particular example.
I really want to emphasize that 2 is a

62
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:49,341
critical point not because the derivative
is equal to 0, but because the function is

63
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:53,759
not differentiable at the .2.
So, to finish off this problem, to find

64
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,905
the minimum and maximum values of my
function f, all I have to do is check the

65
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:03,746
critical points and the endpoints.
So, here's our endpoints, 0 and 3, a place

66
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:07,962
where the derivative vanishes when x is
equal to 1 half and a place where the

67
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,624
derivative is not defined when x is equal
to 2.

68
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:14,990
And where were the original function is?
Alright, f of x is x minus the absolute

69
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,313
value of x squared minus 2 x.
So, what do we get when I plug in 0?

70
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:23,844
I just get 0.
And when I plug in 3, I also get 0, right?

71
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:30,843
3 minus, well, 3 squared is 9 minus 2
times 3, that's 9 minus 3, that's 3.

72
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:35,509
3 minus 3 is also 0.
When I plug in 1 half, I get minus a

73
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,756
quarter.
And when I plug in 2, I get 2.

74
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:43,412
So, I've got my table.
Where is the maximum and where is the

75
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:47,331
minimum?
So, the minimum value is here, when x is

76
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:52,446
equal to 1 half, the functions minimum
value is minus quarter.

77
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:58,683
And the maximum value is when x is equal
to 2, the function's output is 2.

78
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:03,784
Had I not been careful to include x equals
2, the point where the function fails to

79
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:07,877
be differentiable,.
I would have totally missed out on finding

80
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:12,511
the maximum value of this function.
It's really easy to see why this is so

81
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:17,525
important by taking a look at a graph.
We'll use the graph of this function x

82
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:22,316
minus absolute value of x squared minus 2
x on the intervals 0 to 3.

83
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:27,966
And you can see the minimum value occurs
when x is equal to 1 half and the maximum

84
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:32,918
value occurs when x is equal to 2.
And that point really is a place where the

85
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,818
function's not differentiable.
I mean, that's exactly why I see a corner

86
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,464
there.
The upshot here is that a point of

87
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:46,152
non-differentiability, a place where the
function fails to be differentiable could

88
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,164
very well be where the maximum value
occurs.

89
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:55,638
You can think of calculus as a maximum
finding machine and you're trying to find

90
00:06:55,638 --> 00:07:01,355
those maximum values.
So, if Calculus fails you at some place,

91
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:09,475
if the maximum finding machine is broken
for some particular input, that could very

92
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:17,045
well be where the maximum value is hiding.
So, you're going to need to check there.
