music really, we to even 
bother checking endpoints 
so, lets suppose that i want to find 
maximumminimum values this function f 
x equals x minus x cubed 
that function, f, if i considered 
whole real line, doesnt achieve a maximum 
minimum value 
f x is really negative if x is really 
positive 
conversely, f x is really positive 
if x is really negative 
true enough 
so, lets ask a better question 
if i want to maximize minimize 
this function closed interval 
minus to 
this is a continuous function a 
closed bounded interval 
so, extreme value theorem guarantees 
that ill successful, right 
guarantees that there is input 
minimizes this functions value 
input maximizes this functions 
value this interval 
ill begin listing critical 
points this function 
so, ill differentiate this function, 
right 
if i differentiate that function, 
derivative x is , derivative 
minus x cubed is minus x squared 
alright, so, theres derivative 
im looking places 
derivative is equal to , 
derivative doesnt exist 
well, this function is differentiable 
everywhere 
so, theres critical points 
derivative doesnt exist 
there going to places 
derivative is equal to 
lets find 
so, im trying to solve this equation 
ill add x squared to sides, im 
really trying to solve equation, 
equals x squared 
divide sides , so now, im trying 
to solve equation rd equals x 
squared 
now, ill take a square root sides 
ill find that x is equal to 
square root a third maybe negative 
square root a third, so ill write 
x is plus minus square root a 
third 
two critical points this 
function 
oh, im also going to careful to list 
endpoints 
well see we to 
so, here points that i 
check, right 
i check critical points, i 
found two critical points 
negative square root a third, 
positive square root a third 
i also want to check endpoints, 
right 
original question is asking to 
maximize minimize this function 
this interval, includes endpoint 
minus endpoint 
so, im going to include list 
points to check 
so, this continuous function 
achieve maximum value 
this continuous function 
achieve minimum value given 
domain 
so, lets go ahead evaluate 
function four points 
here endpoints, minus , 
critical points plus minus 
square root a third 
i evaluate function 
points, i find 
well, i find that largest output 
occurs x is negative 
smallest, negative output 
occurs x is equal to 
critical points, outputs, you 
know, in size bigger , 
nightmarish scenario wouldve ensued 
i forgotten to include endpoints 
well, heres danger, right 
this is actually im saying 
im saying that if x is in this closed 
interval, largest value 
function occurs x is equal to minus 
, smallest value occurs x is 
equal to 
if i hadnt included endpoints in 
chart, i would fooled 
thinking that largest output this 
function 
this interval, this closed 
interval between minus , 
largest output actually occurs this 
endpoint 
upshot to these, is that 
endpoints are, in sense, critical 
points 
standing an endpoint, you cant wiggle 
freely, so you really cant differentiate 
youre standing an endpoint 
a place you cant differentiate 
thats one critical points
