music critical points to 
include places function fails to 
differentiable 
heres a specific example that we work 
to see necessary to check 
points nondifferentiability 
youll notice that ive included 
absolute value brackets to introduce 
nondifferentiability, okay 
anyway, heres problem 
find maximum minimum values this 
function 
x minus absolute value x squared 
minus x, interval 
between 
well, i proceed 
lets differentiate, okay 
so, i differentiate f prime is, well, 
derivative x is minus derivative 
okay, whoa, wait, i going to 
differentiating this absolute value 
i rewrite this function a piece 
wise function, getting rid absolute 
value 
so, heres original function i 
got an absolute value, remember 
absolute value 
absolute value negates this input if 
inputs negative, right 
so, absolute value guarantees that 
output is positive 
magnitude original input 
so ive got to to rewrite f a 
piecewise function is to deal that, 
right 
ive got to make sure that if this 
input is negative, i better flip 
sign, sign absolute value 
now, i want to know derivative this 
function i compute that 
differentiating piece in 
piecewise define function 
so, here i go 
im going to differentiate two 
pieces separately 
so, derivative f is also a 
piecewise function i 
differentiate this 
derivative x is minus 
derivative this is x, thats 
derivative x squared, 
derivative x is 
this is if x squared minus x 
so, bigger zero 
derivative this is plus 
derivative this, is x minus 
this is if x squared minus x is less 
zero 
youll notice that im careful to 
change greater equal to here 
to greater 
reason is this derivative 
is going to defined this 
quantity is equal to 
now, is time to hunt critical 
points 
so, to simplify hunt critical 
points, i rewrite f prime a little bit 
to make a little bit easier to see 
whats going 
so, we here 
well, minus x minus , thats 
thing three minus x plus x 
minus 
thats thing minus plus x 
alright, i rewrite this x 
squared minus x greater , x 
squared minus x less 
to say that x squared minus x is bigger 
is saying that x is 
less , x is bigger , to 
say that this is less is to 
say that x is trapped between 
alright, that ive got this nicer way 
writing derivative i 
visibly see that something terrible is 
happening when, x is equal to 
if this thing differentiable 
there, youd expect this quantity this 
quantity to agree x equals 
things disagree x is equal 
to , alright 
so, this function ends 
differentiable 
is this thing equal to zero 
well, minus x would vanish if x 
halves 
halves doesnt satisfy this 
so, this first thing never results in a 
critical point derivative 
vanishes 
this 
minus plus x 
well, this is equal to if x is equal to 
a half 
that is in this region 
so here, we know derivative is 
equal to if x is equal to a half 
functions differentiable x is 
equal to 
well, a functions also differentiable 
x is equal to zero 
remember, end points 
interval that considering 
so, if you like, you include a 
point nondifferentiability 
but, in this list end points so 
going to to consider anyhow 
note that theres something really special 
in this particular example 
i really want to emphasize that is a 
critical point derivative 
is equal to , function is 
differentiable 
so, to finish this problem, to find 
minimum maximum values 
function f, i to is check 
critical points endpoints 
so, heres endpoints, , a place 
derivative vanishes x is 
equal to half a place 
derivative is defined x is equal 
to 
original function is 
alright, f x is x minus absolute 
value x squared minus x 
so, we get i plug in 
i get 
i plug in , i also get , right 
minus, well, squared is minus 
times , thats minus , thats 
minus is also 
i plug in half, i get minus a 
quarter 
i plug in , i get 
so, ive got table 
is maximum is 
minimum 
so, minimum value is here, x is 
equal to half, functions minimum 
value is minus quarter 
maximum value is x is equal 
to , functions output is 
i careful to include x equals 
, point function fails to 
differentiable, 
i would totally missed finding 
maximum value this function 
really easy to see this is so 
important taking a look a graph 
well use graph this function x 
minus absolute value x squared minus 
x intervals to 
you see minimum value occurs 
x is equal to half maximum 
value occurs x is equal to 
that point really is a place 
functions differentiable 
i mean, thats exactly i see a corner 
there 
upshot here is that a point 
nondifferentiability, a place 
function fails to differentiable could 
well maximum value 
occurs 
you think calculus a maximum 
finding machine youre trying to find 
maximum values 
so, if calculus fails you place, 
if maximum finding machine is broken 
particular input, that could 
well maximum value is hiding 
so, youre going to need to check there
