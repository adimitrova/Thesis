1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,571
[music] Really, why do we have to even
bother checking endpoints?

2
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:15,235
So, let's suppose that I want to find the
maximum-minimum values of this function f

3
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:21,143
of x equals x minus x cubed.
That function, f, if I considered on the

4
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:26,097
whole real line, doesn't achieve a maximum
or minimum value.

5
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:30,077
F of x is really negative if x is really
positive.

6
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:35,423
And conversely, f of x is really positive
if x is really negative.

7
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:39,968
True enough.
So, let's ask a better question.

8
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:46,159
What if I want to maximize and minimize
this function on the closed interval for

9
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,975
minus 3 to 3?
This is now a continuous function on a

10
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:55,162
closed bounded interval.
So, the extreme value theorem guarantees

11
00:00:55,162 --> 00:01:00,300
that I'll be successful, right?
It guarantees that there is some input

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,432
which minimizes this function's value and
some input which maximizes this function's

13
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,868
value on this interval.
I'll begin by listing off the critical

14
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:15,303
points for this function.
So, I'll differentiate this function,

15
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:18,555
right?
And if I differentiate that function, the

16
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:23,559
derivative of x is 1, and the derivative
of minus x cubed is minus 3 x squared.

17
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:27,951
Alright, so, there's the derivative.
I'm looking for places where the

18
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,827
derivative is equal to 0, or the
derivative doesn't exist.

19
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:35,151
Well, this function is differentiable
everywhere.

20
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:39,499
So, there's no critical points where the
derivative doesn't exist.

21
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,871
But there are going to be some places
where the derivative is equal to 0.

22
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:47,316
Let's find them now.
So, I'm trying to solve this equation.

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:51,669
I'll add 3x squared to both sides, I'm
really trying to solve the equation, 1

24
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:55,674
equals 3x squared.
Divide both sides by 3, so now, I'm trying

25
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,801
to solve the equation 1 3rd equals x
squared.

26
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,581
Now, I'll take a square root of both sides
and I'll find that x is equal to the

27
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:08,663
square root of a third or maybe negative
the square root of a third, so I'll write

28
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,574
x is plus or minus the square root of a
third.

29
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:15,012
These are the two critical points for this
function.

30
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:17,766
Oh, I'm also going to be careful to list
the endpoints.

31
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:21,037
And we'll see why we have to.
So, here are the points that I should

32
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,832
check, right?
I should check the critical points, and I

33
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:27,652
just found those two critical points.
Negative square root of a third, and

34
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:31,254
positive square root of a third.
And I also want to check the endpoints,

35
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,754
right?
And my original question is asking me to

36
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:38,234
maximize and minimize this function on
this interval, which includes the endpoint

37
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:41,627
minus 3 and the endpoint 3.
So, I'm going to include those on the list

38
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,888
of points to check.
So, where does this continuous function

39
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:48,333
achieve its maximum value?
And where does this continuous function

40
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,750
achieve its minimum value on the given
domain?

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,348
So, let's go ahead and just evaluate the
function at those four points.

42
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:58,384
Here are the endpoints, minus 3 and 3, and
the critical points plus or minus the

43
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:01,676
square root of a third.
And when I evaluate the function at these

44
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,814
points, what do I find?
Well, I find that the largest output

45
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:08,726
occurs when x is negative 3.
And the smallest, the most negative output

46
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:12,984
occurs when x is equal to 3.
At these critical points, the outputs, you

47
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,802
know, in size no bigger than 1, it's about
0.38.

48
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:20,951
What nightmarish scenario would've ensued
had I forgotten to include the endpoints?

49
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,827
Well, here's the danger, right?
This is actually what I'm saying.

50
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:29,558
I'm saying that if x is in this closed
interval, then the largest value of the

51
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:34,583
function occurs when x is equal to minus
3, and the smallest value occurs when x is

52
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,899
equal to 3.
If I hadn't included the endpoints in my

53
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:42,891
chart, I would have been fooled into
thinking that the largest output of this

54
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,931
function was 0.38.
But on this interval, on this closed

55
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:52,573
interval between minus 3 and 3, the
largest output actually occurs at this

56
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:56,211
endpoint.
The upshot to all of these, is that the

57
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,836
endpoints are, in some sense, critical
points.

58
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:06,232
Standing at an endpoint, you can't wiggle
freely, so you really can't differentiate

59
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:12,294
when you're standing at an endpoint.
And a place where you can't differentiate

60
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,000
that's one of the critical points.
