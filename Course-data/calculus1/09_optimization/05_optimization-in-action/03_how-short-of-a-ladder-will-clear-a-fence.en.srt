00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,223
[music] In our calculus class so far, some
of the applications have involved sheep

2
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:14,933
trapped inside fences and ladders leaning
up against buildings.

3
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:18,021
Well, here's a scene that combines all
these things.

4
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:21,191
I've got a sheep, I've got a fence, I've
got a ladder.

5
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:25,271
Here's a really tall barn.
Here's the sun shining down on the ground.

6
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:30,176
Let's suppose that you're the sheep, stuck
behind the fence, but eager to get to the

7
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,992
barn.
The really good news is that you're not

8
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:36,174
just a regular sheep, you're some sort of
ninja sheep.

9
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:39,418
And you've got a supply of a bunch of
different ladders.

10
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:43,091
The question is, what's the shortest
ladder that you can use?

11
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:48,350
You want to pick the shortest ladder that
you can get away with, which goes over the

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,405
fence and touches the barn.
I mean, if the ladder is too short, it

13
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:56,712
won't even go over the fence.
But, even this longer ladder, I mean, it

14
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:01,362
will get you over the fence, but this
ladder is not long enough yet to get you

15
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,493
all the way to the barn.
At this point, you're probably feeling

16
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:08,472
really bad.
You now recognize that this is an

17
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:12,724
optimization problem, but you're thinking,
oh no, not again.

18
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:17,395
Not another optimization problem.
Well, let me say a little more about

19
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:21,441
exactly how tall the fence is, and how far
it is from the barn.

20
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:24,487
Let's say that, that fence is 6.4 meters
tall.

21
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:29,569
And let's say that the fence is 2.7 meters
from the barn.

22
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:35,229
Is something sounding familiar here?
Yeah, we've seen numbers like 64 and 27

23
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,111
come up before.
We saw them in that hallway problem,

24
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:42,199
right?
What did I want to do in the hallway

25
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:46,070
problem?
I wanted to take some stick and figure out

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,866
what the, in this case, longest stick was
that I could navigate through this

27
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,365
hallway.
But as, remember, the issue was finding

28
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,954
the shortest stick which simultaneously
touched this bottom wall, this wall here

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,351
in the corner.
That's really the exact same problem.

30
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:09,093
We just have to think about this problem
in, in different terms.

31
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:13,038
Instead of thinking of this as a wall, I
think of this as the ground.

32
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:17,837
Instead of thinking of this is a wall, I
think of this as the side of the barn.

33
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:22,003
And I want to pass through this point.
I want to touch this corner, which really

34
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,410
just means I want to clear the fence, you
know?

35
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:29,548
And because this problem happened to be
solved by a stick of length 125

36
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:35,485
millimeters, this problem is going to be
solved by a ladder of length 12.5 meters.

37
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:41,119
And here, and this drawing is actually to
scale so I can, I can really demonstrate

38
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,552
it, you know?
Here, I position the ladder and yeah,

39
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:49,752
this, this ladder is in fact long enough
to touch the ground, the barn, and just

40
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,477
clear the fence.
We've done a ton of stuff this week, but

41
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:56,772
this is perhaps the most important lesson
of all.

42
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:00,868
At it's core, mathematics is not about
just solving problems.

43
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:06,562
What we've done here is realize an analogy
between two seemingly different problems,

44
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,740
alright?
The problem of a stick turning a corner

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,778
and a ladder clearing a fence.
More than about solving problems,

46
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:18,322
mathematics is really about these kinds of
analogies, about being able to recognize

47
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:21,162
that things that look different are really
the same.

48
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:25,520
People have been doing mathematics for
thousands of years, and there's been a ton

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,958
of new mathematics developed in that time.
So, you might think that with all the new

50
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,431
mathematics, that mathematics would be
constantly splintering off and fracturing

51
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,941
into different subjects.
But that's not what's happened at all.

52
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:44,634
This desire to analogize, to unify.
To see different parts of the elephant as

53
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:51,316
the same elephant, right?
This tendency has really kept mathematics

54
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:56,307
together.
It means that mathematics doesn't appear

55
00:03:56,307 --> 00:04:02,735
as a bunch of separate subjects, it really
appears as a unified whole.
