music this is a story three 
bubbles 
well really three bubble walls, 
alright 
i imagine that ive got this pane glass 
here, alright 
ive got three points connected 
three edges bubble 
so, bits bubble end 
intersecting 
this actually turns to an 
optimization problem 
bubbles wants to small possible 
so, less colorfully, this is im 
really asking 
i imagine that ive got a triangle, 
im trying to find a point in middle 
triangle so that sum 
three lengths, a plus b plus c, is 
small possible 
try to minimize total length 
bubble 
lets make this concrete 
lets actually pick points place 
triangle point 
anyhow, we drawing a picture, 
right 
we starting drawing a 
picture 
so, concreteness, im going to put 
vertices here ,, ,, , 
then, i trying to do, well, 
im trying to find a point, i call x,y, 
in in middle triangle so 
that lengths this length here, 
im calling a, length x,y to 
origin, i call b, length x,y 
to point ,, ill call c 
i want a plus b plus c to small 
possible 
im trying to minimize sum 
lengths to vertices 
way that ive set this problem 
way that ive exactly positioned 
vertices introduces a symmetry that we 
exploit in this problem 
this configuration is symmetric across 
line y equals x bubbles really 
shouldnt prefer one side 
i mean, bubble knows left 
right 
so solution, point that minimizes 
sum distances to 
vertices lie this line, so i 
say that coordinates x,x, so 
whats goal 
so im trying to find value x, so, 
that this point x,x minimizes sum 
distances to vertices 
now, i write that 
well, heres a formula sum 
distances to vertices 
this first part, square root x 
squared plus x squared 
thats pythagorean theorem, 
right 
far is point x,x point 
, 
well, heres a right triangle 
two legs this right triangle 
length x 
so, length a hypotenuse is 
square root x squared plus x squared 
what, say, this term here, is 
square root minus x squared plus x 
squared come 
well, take a look this little tiny 
right triangle here 
this right triangle this leg 
length x this leg length minus 
x 
so, long is hypotenuse, is 
distance x,x to , 
well, square root minus x 
squared plus x squared 
this last term, this square root x 
squared plus one minus x squared, thats 
measuring distance , to 
x,x 
i simplify this, somewhat 
this first term, this square root x 
squared plus x squared, well, i could 
rewrite that square root x 
squared 
terms actually 

addition is done in a 
different order but, course, doesnt 
effect value so i write 
this two copies this first one, 
square root minus x squared plus 
x square 
so, this is a slightly easier way 
writing f 
we also review if theres 
constraints this problem 
im going to find a little bit easier 
if i assume that x is bigger equal 
to 
in that case, square root x 
squared rewritten in an even easier 
way, right 
square root x squared is 
absolute value x 
if i assume that x is bigger 
equal to , i could rewrite this 
square root times x plus, 
this term, times square 
root minus x squared plus x squared 
so, weve got function a single 
variable so we apply calculus 
we differentiate 
so, here we go 
i want to differentiate this 
f prime is, well, derivative a 
sum, is sum derivative 
so, i to first differentiate square 
root times x 
square root plus times 
something 
so, will times derivative 
that thing 
is derivative minus x squared 
plus x squared, this square 
root 
alright, i keep going here 
i got square root plus times 
i differentiate a square root 
well, derivative square root is 
times square root i use 
chain rule so will 
times square inside function 
here, is minus x squared plus x 
squared times derivative inside 
function 
so, derivative minus x squared 
plus x squared 
alright, lets this 
so, i got square root , plus, oh, 
i cancel this this , so, ive 
got square root minus x 
squared plus x squared times, i got to 
differentiate this sum, is sum 
derivatives 
so, derivative minus x squared, 
thats times one minus x times 
derivative inside function, 
derivation minus x is minus , plus 
derivative x squared, is 
x 
so, heres derivative f 
derivative in hand, we look 
critical points, places 
function either isnt differentiable 
derivative is equal to 
i dont to worry critical 
points derivative doesnt exist 
this function is differentiable 
everywhere 
so, im looking values x 
derivative is equal to 
let rewrite this derivative even a 
little bit nicely 
so, derivative is square root 
plus, this thing i want to 
simplify a little bit here 
i got 
i got x 
ive got another x here 
so, x minus 
so, x minus this denominator, 
square root minus x squared plus x 
squared 
alright, pretty good 
im looking values x that 
thing is equal to 
ill subtract square root 
sides 
that means im looking values x 
so that x minus square root 
minus x squared plus x squared, is equal 
to negative square root 
then, ill multiply sides this 
denominator 
that means im looking values 
x 
so that x minus is negative square 
root times square root minus 
x squared plus x squared 
now, i solve an equation like this 
well, one trick i use is to square 
sides, that might introduce extra 
solutions 
i go back and, figure 
exactly solution is still a solution 
to this original problem 
so, lets square sides 
so, ive got x minus squared is 
negative square root times minus x 
squared plus x squared, this whole thing 
squared 
now, i expand that a bit, 
right 
whats x minus squared 
well, thats x squared minus x plus 
whats this side 
well, squaring negative gets rid 

squaring square root is , 
square this thing, this is 
positive so whatever is inside 
radical, is minus x squared 
plus x squared 
okay, so i got x squared minus x plus 
i expand this thing 
alright, this is a minus x 
here, i got a plus x squared another x 
squared so plus x squared 
ill expand this whole side so thats 
minus x plus x squared ill 
subtract this sides ill get 
x uh,squared minus x plus , is equal 
to 
so, this is a quadratic equation, 
alright, i solve that quadratic 
equation using say, a quadratic 
formula 
i get that x is half plus minus 
square root , alright 
so this is an application quadratic 
equation to solve this, quadratic 
now, issue here is that, turns 
that im getting solutions x 
is actually a place 
derivative is equal to zero 
so if youre careful, you check 
turns that this is in fact, a minus 
sign 
so this is critical point x 
equals half minus square 
root 
so, ive got a critical point 
lets draw a picture see exactly 
critical point lands inside 
triangle 
so, a little bit numerics this 
critical point ends point 
, yeah, i mean i plot this right 
here 
this is point x,x x is equal to 
this 
and, you know, maybe that looks believable 
bubble walls would 
intersect in order to minimize sum 
distances 
theres work to 
to actually show that critical point 
indeed give rise to global minimum 
value this function, we need to 
work 
lets put that 
instead, i want to focus in an angle 
calculation 
in particular, i want to calculate this 
angle here, angle that this bubble 
this bubble make point 
intersect 
i that law sines 
calculation i also need to know to 
length this piece bubble if 
you calculation, that will 
square rd 
alright, so im going to use fact that 
i know this length, oh, i also know 
this bottom length is i know this 
angle, right 
line y equals x makes a degree 
angle xaxis 
so, i put that information together 
a law sines calculation, right 
sine pi , thats this angle, a 
degree angle divided length 
opposite side square root 
rd 
well, that sine theta divided 
length opposite side is 
now, i want to try to figure sine 
theta is 
well, ive got bits information 
here that i need 
i know sine pi is 
square root 
so, square root , 
divided square root rd is 
equal to sine theta 
this, yeah, if calculate it, 
square root 
now, you might tempted to apply 
arc sine to square root three 
two 
you to think a little bit 
domain here, exactly this 
angle theta lie 
between degrees 
a theta, if you look picture, is 
bigger degrees, so im looking 
an angle between, say, degrees 
whose sine is square root , 
that actually nails theta us 
theta is pi three radians 
degrees 
so, bubble walls meet degree 
angles we see this real in 
nature 
look degree angles 
calculations that here 
symbols page 
yet, somehow, manage to govern 
real physical world, right 
bubbles know calculus 
somehow, calculus knows bubbles
