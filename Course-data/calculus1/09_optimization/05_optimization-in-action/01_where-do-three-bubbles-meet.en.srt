1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,596
[music] This is a story about three
bubbles.

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:08,818
Well it's really about three bubble walls,
alright?

3
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:14,454
I imagine that I've got this pane of glass
here, alright?

4
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:20,576
And I've got three points connected by
three edges of bubble.

5
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:24,079
So, where do these bits of bubble end up
intersecting?

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,641
This actually turns out to be an
optimization problem.

7
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:32,676
Bubbles wants to be as small as possible.
So, less colorfully, this is what I'm

8
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:36,460
really asking for.
I imagine that I've got a triangle, and

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,516
I'm trying to find a point in the middle
of the triangle so that the sum of these

10
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:45,128
three lengths, a plus b plus c, is as
small as possible.

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,190
Try to minimize the total length of
bubble.

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,467
Let's make this concrete.
Let's actually pick points and place the

13
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:56,629
triangle at those point.
Anyhow, we should be drawing a picture,

14
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,260
right?
We should be starting by drawing a

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,388
picture.
So, for concreteness, I'm going to put the

16
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:07,621
3 vertices here at 0,1, 0,0, and 1,0.
And then, what am I trying to do, well,

17
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:13,651
I'm trying to find a point, I call it x,y,
in the in the middle of the triangle so

18
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:20,131
that these lengths this length here, which
I'm calling a, the length from x,y to the

19
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:25,862
origin, I call b, and the length from x,y
to the point 1,0, which I'll call c.

20
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,986
I want a plus b plus c to be as small as
possible.

21
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:33,034
I'm trying to minimize the sum of the
lengths to the vertices.

22
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:38,516
The way that I've set up this problem.
The way that I've exactly positioned these

23
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:43,419
3 vertices introduces a symmetry that we
can exploit in this problem.

24
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:48,253
This configuration is symmetric across the
line y equals x and the bubbles really

25
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:53,089
shouldn't prefer one side or the other.
I mean, what does bubble knows about left

26
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:57,247
and right?
So the solution, the point that minimizes

27
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:03,261
the sum of the distances to these 3
vertices should lie on this line, so I can

28
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:07,616
say that its coordinates are x,x, so
what's the goal?

29
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:13,212
So I'm trying to find the value of x, so,
that this point x,x minimizes the sum of

30
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:17,741
the distances to the 3 vertices.
Now, how do I write that down?

31
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:22,861
Well, here's a formula for the sum of the
distances to these 3 vertices.

32
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:26,550
This first part, the square root of x
squared plus x squared.

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,992
That's just the Pythagorean Theorem,
right?

34
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,382
How far is the point x,x from the point
0,0?

35
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:35,113
Well, here's a right triangle.
And the two legs of this right triangle

36
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,992
both have length x.
So, the length of a hypotenuse is he

37
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:43,444
square root of x squared plus x squared.
What, say, this term here, where is the

38
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:48,038
square root of 1 minus x squared plus x
squared come from?

39
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:52,539
Well, take a look at this little tiny
right triangle here.

40
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:58,625
This right triangle has this leg with
length x and this leg with length 1 minus

41
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,951
x.
So, how long is the hypotenuse, which is

42
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:07,104
the distance from x,x to 1,0?
Well, it's the square root of 1 minus x

43
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:11,388
squared plus x squared.
This last term, this square root of x

44
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:16,748
squared plus one minus x squared, that's
measuring the distance from 0,1 down to

45
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,217
x,x.
I can simplify this, somewhat.

46
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:24,121
This first term, this square root of x
squared plus x squared, well, I could

47
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,559
rewrite that as just the square root of 2x
squared.

48
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,412
And both of these terms are actually the
same.

49
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:35,026
It's just the addition is done in a
different order but, of course, it doesn't

50
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:39,634
effect the value at all so I can write
this as two copies of just this first one,

51
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:42,709
the square root of 1 minus x squared plus
x square.

52
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,874
So, this is a slightly easier way of
writing f.

53
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:50,519
We should also review if there's any
constraints on this problem.

54
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,115
I'm going to find it a little bit easier
if I assume that x is bigger than or equal

55
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,214
to 0.
In that case, the square root of 2x

56
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:03,562
squared can be rewritten in an even easier
way, right?

57
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:06,947
The square root of x squared is the
absolute value of x.

58
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:11,741
But if I assume that x is bigger than or
equal to 0, then I could rewrite this as

59
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:16,529
just the square root of 2 times x plus,
and this other term, 2 times the square

60
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,544
root of 1 minus x squared plus x squared.
So, we've got our function of a single

61
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:25,020
variable so we can apply calculus.
We can differentiate.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,621
So, here we go.
I want to differentiate this.

63
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:32,775
F prime is, well, it's the derivative of a
sum, which is the sum of the derivative.

64
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:35,851
So, I have to first differentiate square
root of 2 times x.

65
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:39,525
As just the square root of 2 plus 2 times
something.

66
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:43,103
So, it will be 2 times the derivative of
that thing.

67
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:48,485
It is the derivative of 1 minus x squared
plus x squared, all under this square

68
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,191
root.
Alright, and I can keep on going here.

69
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:55,758
I got the square root of 2 plus 2 times.
How do I differentiate a square root?

70
00:04:55,758 --> 00:05:01,242
Well, the derivative of the square root is
1 over 2 times the square root but I use

71
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:06,305
the chain rule so it will be 1 over 2
times the square of the inside function

72
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:11,866
here, which is 1 minus x squared plus x
squared times the derivative of the inside

73
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:15,590
function.
So, the derivative of 1 minus x squared

74
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,113
plus x squared.
Alright, let's do this again.

75
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:24,789
So, I got the square root of 2, plus, oh,
I can cancel this 2 and this 2, so, I've

76
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,279
got 1 over the square root of 1 minus x
squared plus x squared times, I got to

77
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,140
differentiate this sum, which is the sum
of derivatives again.

78
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,106
So, the derivative of 1 minus x squared,
that's 2 times one minus x times the

79
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:45,306
derivative of the inside function, the
derivation of 1 minus x is minus 1, plus

80
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:48,426
the derivative of x squared, which is just
2x.

81
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:52,853
So, here's the derivative of f.
With the derivative in hand, we can look

82
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,543
for the critical points, places where the
function either isn't differentiable or

83
00:05:57,543 --> 00:06:01,527
where the derivative is equal to 0.
I don't have to worry about critical

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,142
points where the derivative doesn't exist
because this function is differentiable

85
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:09,262
everywhere.
So, I'm just looking for values of x where

86
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:14,032
the derivative is equal to 0.
Let me rewrite this derivative even a

87
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:19,111
little bit more nicely.
So, the derivative is the square root of 2

88
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:23,528
plus, and it's this thing I want to
simplify a little bit here.

89
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,229
What do I got?
I got 2x.

90
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,105
And then I've got another 2x here.
So, it's 4x minus 2.

91
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:34,766
So, 4x minus 2 over this denominator, the
square root of 1 minus x squared plus x

92
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,949
squared.
Alright, pretty good.

93
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,724
I'm looking for values of x where that
thing is equal to 0.

94
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,897
I'll subtract the square root of 2 from
both sides.

95
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:48,844
That means I'm looking for values of x.
So that 4x minus 2 over the square root of

96
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:53,284
1 minus x squared plus x squared, is equal
to negative square root of 2.

97
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,767
And then, I'll multiply both sides by this
denominator.

98
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,596
And that means I'm looking for values of
x.

99
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:04,882
So that 4x minus 2 is negative the square
root of 2 times the square root of 1 minus

100
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:09,305
x squared plus x squared.
Now, how do I solve an equation like this?

101
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:14,327
Well, one trick I can use is to square
both sides, and that might introduce extra

102
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:18,680
solutions.
But I can go back then and, and figure out

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,091
exactly which solution is still a solution
to this original problem.

104
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:29,098
So, let's square both sides.
So, I've got 4x minus 2 squared is

105
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:35,999
negative square root of 2 times 1 minus x
squared plus x squared, this whole thing

106
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,733
squared.
And now, I can expand that out a bit,

107
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,881
right?
What's 4x minus 2 squared?

108
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:47,961
Well, that's 16x squared minus 16x plus 4.
And what's this side?

109
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,336
Well, squaring the negative gets rid of
it.

110
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:57,790
Squaring the square root of 2 is 2, and
then the square of this thing, this is

111
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,654
positive so it's just whatever is inside
the radical, which is 1 minus x squared

112
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:10,389
plus x squared.
Okay, so I got 16x squared minus 16x plus

113
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,611
4.
I can expand this thing out.

114
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:21,555
Alright, this is a 1 minus 2x and then
here, I got a plus x squared and another x

115
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:29,528
squared so plus 2x squared.
I'll expand this whole side out so that's

116
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:38,600
2 minus 4x plus 4x squared and I'll
subtract this from both sides and I'll get

117
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,102
12x uh,squared minus 12x plus 2, is equal
to 0.

118
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:52,608
So, this is just a quadratic equation,
alright, and I can solve that quadratic

119
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:57,303
equation by using say, a quadratic
formula.

120
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:04,434
And I get that x is 1 half 1 plus or minus
1 over the square root of 3, alright?

121
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:10,911
So this is an application of the quadratic
equation to solve this, quadratic.

122
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,904
Now, the issue here is that, it turns out
that I'm getting 2 solutions for x.

123
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:22,936
But only 1 of these is actually a place
where the derivative is equal to zero.

124
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:28,489
So if you're careful, and you check.
It turns out that this is in fact, a minus

125
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,109
sign.
So this is the only critical point x

126
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:34,085
equals 1 half 1 minus 1 over the square
root of 3.

127
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:38,945
So, I've got a critical point.
Let's draw a picture and see exactly where

128
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,326
the critical point lands inside our
triangle.

129
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:48,520
So, doing a little bit of numerics this
critical point ends up at being at point

130
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,076
2,1 and yeah, I mean I can plot this right
here.

131
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:55,736
This is the point x,x when x is equal to
this.

132
00:09:55,736 --> 00:10:00,484
And, you know, maybe that looks believable
as where these bubble walls would

133
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:04,246
intersect in order to minimize the sum of
these 3 distances.

134
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:08,462
There's more work to do.
To actually show that critical point does

135
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:13,478
indeed give rise to the global minimum
value of this function, we need to do more

136
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,816
work.
But let's put that off for now.

137
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,206
Instead, I want to focus in on an angle
calculation.

138
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:24,518
In particular, I want to calculate this
angle here, the angle that this bubble and

139
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:27,966
this bubble make at the point where they
intersect.

140
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:33,156
And I can do that with the law of sines
calculation but I also need to know to the

141
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:38,502
length of this piece of the bubble and if
you do the calculation, that will be the

142
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:42,158
square of 2 3rd.
Alright, so I'm going to use the fact that

143
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:47,056
I know this length, oh, and I also know
this bottom length is 1 and I know this

144
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:50,375
angle, right?
The line y equals x makes a 45-degree

145
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,332
angle with the x-axis.
So, I put all that information together

146
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:59,117
into a law of sines calculation, right?
Sine of pi over 4, that's this angle, a

147
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,927
45-degree angle divided by the length of
the opposite side the square root of 2

148
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,584
3rd.
Well, that sine of theta divided by the

149
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:12,036
length of the opposite side which is 1.
Now, I want to try to figure out what sine

150
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:16,120
of theta is.
Well, I've got all the bits of information

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,040
here that I need.
I know sine of pi over 4 is 1 over the

152
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,945
square root of 2.
So, it's 1 over the square root of 2,

153
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:28,342
divided by the square root of 2 3rd is
equal to sine of theta.

154
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:33,895
And this, yeah, if it calculate it, it's
the square root of 3 over 2.

155
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:39,613
Now, you might be tempted just to apply
arc sine to the square root of three over

156
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,772
two.
But you have to think a little bit about

157
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:47,179
the domain here, exactly where does this
angle theta lie?

158
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:52,562
It's not between 0 and 90 degrees.
A theta, if you look at the picture, is

159
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:58,358
bigger than 90 degrees, so I'm looking for
an angle between, say, 90 and 180 degrees

160
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:04,456
whose sine is the square root of 3 over 2,
and that actually nails down theta for us.

161
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:09,246
Theta is 2 pi over three radians or 120
degrees.

162
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:16,548
So, these bubble walls meet at 120 degree
angles and we can see this for real in

163
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:20,566
nature.
Look at these 120 degree angles.

164
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:27,467
The calculations that we're doing here are
just symbols on the page.

165
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:35,007
And yet, somehow, they manage to govern
the real physical world, right?

166
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:45,184
What do bubbles know about Calculus?
But somehow, Calculus knows about bubbles.
