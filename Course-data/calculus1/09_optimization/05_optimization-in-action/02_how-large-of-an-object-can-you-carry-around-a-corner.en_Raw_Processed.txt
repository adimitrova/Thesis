heres another timeless classic, another 
optimization problem that comes in 
calculus textbooks 
goes like this youve got big object 
you want to move that big object 
around a corner 
question is given corner, 
big a object you navigate around 
that corner 
this is an example so called piano 
moving problem 
a piano is way to complicated an object 
to really understand in this course right, 
got a way to much geometry going 
there 
so going to consider a simpler example 
so heres diagram a corner i 
mentioned that i want to move this red 
stick around this corner without 
getting stuck 
maybe doesnt look like this 
problem set an optimization 
problem we solve 
an optimization problem, im 
asking to know length longest 
stick, that i navigate around this 
corner 
we to think that stick 
get stuck 
well stick is going to get stuck 
in a position like this 
touching two walls 
pressed this corner 
so, i actually to think is 
whats shortest length stick that 
simultaneously touches this wall, this 
wall this corner 
i think a little bit funny that in 
order to solve this problem, we end 
minimizing something 
we actually want to figure longest 
length, maximum length a stick that 
navigated around that corner 
to answer that problem, we end 
solving a minimization problem 
well anyhow, lets proceed in usual 
way 
im going to draw a picture label 
everything 
so, here i drawn this picture i 
labelled every thing 
width this hallway is a, width 
this hallway is b, length this 
stick is l, makes this angle theta 
this bottom wall 
we gotta figure is that we 
trying to optimize 
whats quantity that we trying to 
minimize 
whats goal 
so goal is to minimize length 
this stick, right 
i want to know shortest length that 
touches two walls this corner, 
thatll constrain largest stick 
thatll fit around this corner 
now, hallways fixed lengths, 
id like to express length this 
stick in terms this angle theta 
so i break stick pieces 
theres a piece that goes this wall 
to corner a piece this corner 
to wall 
so this piece here, well thats really 
hypotenuse a right triangle, whose 
opposite side to this angle theta 
length a 
that means this hypotenuse length 
a times cosecant theta 
similarly here i got a right triangle 
i got this side length here is b so, 
hypotenuse length b times secant 
theta stick is sum 
two lengths so that gives a 
formula l in terms theta 
l is a cosecant theta plus b secant theta 
whats constraint in this problem 
yeah i need to think theta 
between pi in order to 
touch two walls corner 
so weve got a function, 
function a single variable so we 
apply calculus 
so, im going to differentiate this 
function, right, derivative l 
respect to theta 
well whats derivative cosecant 
thats minus cosecant theta cotangent 
theta 
whats derivative secant 
well thats secant theta tangent theta 
so thats derivative l minus a 
cosecant theta cotangent theta plus b 
secant theta tangent theta 
derivative in hand i try 
to find critical points this 
function 
since this function l is 
differentiable domain that 
considering, i dont to worry 
places l fails to differentiable 
im looking critical points 
i need to find points 
derivative is equal to zero 
so values theta this 
thing vanish 
well, lets write this an equation 
equal to , lets add a cosecant theta 
contangent theta to sides 
so ive got b secant theta tangent 
theta is equal to a cosecant theta 
cotangent theta 
i, i will divide sides cosecant 
theta, cotangent theta i will divide 
sides b so that i got secant 
theta, tangent theta divided cosecant 
theta, cotangent theta is equal to a 
b 
i notice here 
well dividing cotangent is good 
multiplying tangent 
secant cosecant is actually 
tangent 
so this is in fact tangent cubed 
so ive got tangent cubed theta 
is equal to a b 
if i take a cubed route now, i get that 
tangent theta is equal to cube root 
a b 
in words, theta is arc tangent 
cube root a b 
so i know theta is, i dont 
care theta 
i really care is l 
whats length 
so lets evaluate l theta 
critical point 
now, wheres critical point 
tangent theta is equal to 
cube root a b 
i build a right triangle an angle 
whose tangent is cube root a 
b 
i that follows 
i make this length 
this length cube root a b 
that makes tangent theta 
is this divided this equal to this 
right this is in denominator 
that is right triangle means i 
compute length hypotenuse 
right 
length hypotenuse is a square root 
sum two lengths squared 
thats i written 
here 
okay, so ive got a right triangle 
ive got an angle whose tangent is theta 
im trying to calculate l theta 
if you remember back l defined in 
terms cosecant secant 
i compute cosecant secant 
this angle theta whose tangent is this 
quantity reading cosecant 
secant this triangle 
so cosecant remember is a one 
sine means hypotenuse divided 
opposite side length thats 
i got here, length hypotenuse 
divided length opposite side 
secant, remember is one cosine so 
that means side length 
hypotenuse divided this length, 
is one 
i know cosecant secant in 
terms this quantity here, i 
evaluate l that quantity 
so here we go, this is i get i 
plug in quantities coseekit, 
seekit 
get 
this looks terrible, right 
well, i simplify this a little bit 
you notice here 
ive got a dividing cubert b in 
denominator, is good 
putting a b to thirds power here 
here im going to separate this b 
to b a b to two thirds times b to 
one third move that inside square 
root 
upshot is that this thing is in fact 
this thing here 
this begins to a little bit 
symmetric, right 
i took a cube root a 
that gave a to rds 
putting a b to rds inside here, i 
made this look a lot, a lot nicer 
okay 
ive got a common factor square 
root b to rds plus a to 
rds here i collect that 
so ive got a to rds plus b to 
rds times square root b to 
rds plus a to rds 
this is thing, here 
this thing times square root that 
thing 
another way saying that is 
this quantity to power, right 
this is this quantity to first power, 
times power, that gives 
power, here 
so, critical point, l theta is 
equal to this quantity 
a bit work, we show that 
this quantity is in fact minimum value 
l 
we summarize answer 
so given a hallway width a meeting a 
hallway width b corner, 
weve shown is that a stick length 
most, a to two thirds plus b to 
two thirds, that quantity to three 
halves power navigated around that 
corner 
we see this playing in action 
i made a model that you download well 
here is an example 
ive got a hallway width 
millimeters, thats a pretty small 
hallway, right 
ive got another hallway here, 
millimeters 
calculation that weve done tells 
us that a stick length millimeters 
will able to turnaround, this 
hallway 
so lets see 
heres stick i start stick 
moving hallway, right 
i start trying to rotate around 
eventually im going to bump 
corner , ill able to make 
around corner ill able 
to move hallway 
perhaps youre wondering 
numbers came 
well heres i got numbers 
from, right 
, widths 
hallways this is formula that 
tells us largest stick that pass 
a hallway two widths 
i chose for, maybe two 
different reasons 
one thing is that perfect 
cubes 
so, to one third power is 
to one third power is 
thing thats nice 
numbers is that squared plus squared 
is squared, right 
pythagorean triple 
squared to is 
so cubed is
