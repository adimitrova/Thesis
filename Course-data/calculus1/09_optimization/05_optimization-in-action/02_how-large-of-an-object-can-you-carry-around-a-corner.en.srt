00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,068
Here's another timeless classic, another
optimization problem that just comes up in

2
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:12,986
all the calculus textbooks.
Goes like this: you've got some big object

3
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:17,193
and you want to move that big object
around a corner.

4
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:22,626
The question is for some given corner, how
big of a object can you navigate around

5
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,097
that corner.
This is an example of the so called piano

6
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:29,811
moving problem.
A piano is way to complicated of an object

7
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:35,201
to really understand in this course right,
it's just got a way to much geometry going

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,461
on there.
So going to consider a simpler example.

9
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:44,378
So here's our diagram of a corner and I
mentioned that I want to move this red

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,605
stick around this corner without it
getting stuck.

11
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:54,819
Maybe it doesn't look like it but this
problem can be set up as an optimization

12
00:00:54,819 --> 00:01:00,336
problem and we can solve it.
It's an optimization problem, because I'm

13
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:06,121
asking to know the length of the longest
stick, that I can navigate around this

14
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:09,709
corner.
We have to think about where that stick

15
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,156
can get stuck.
Well the stick is going to get stuck when

16
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,313
it's in a position like this.
When it's touching these two walls and

17
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:21,796
pressed up against this corner.
So, what I actually have to think about is

18
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:26,760
what's the shortest length of stick that
simultaneously touches this wall, this

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,380
wall and this corner.
I think it's a little bit funny that in

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,875
order to solve this problem, we end up
minimizing something.

21
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:38,504
We actually want to figure out the longest
length, the maximum length of a stick that

22
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:42,666
can be navigated around that corner.
But to answer that problem, we end up

23
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:46,846
solving a minimization problem.
Well anyhow, let's proceed in our usual

24
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:49,022
way.
I'm going to draw a picture and label

25
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:52,098
everything.
So, here I have drawn this picture and I

26
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:56,017
have labelled every thing.
The width of this hallway is a, the width

27
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:00,427
of this hallway is b, the length of this
stick is l, and makes this angle theta

28
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:04,080
with this bottom wall.
Now we gotta figure out what it is that we

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,775
are trying to optimize.
What's the quantity that we are trying to

30
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,495
minimize?
What's the goal?

31
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,585
So my goal is to minimize the length of
this stick, right?

32
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:19,399
I want to know the shortest length that
touches these two walls and this corner,

33
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:24,790
and that'll constrain the largest stick
that'll fit around this corner.

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,216
Now, my hallways have fixed lengths, and
I'd like to express the length of this

35
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:33,564
stick in terms of this angle theta.
So I can break up the stick into 2 pieces.

36
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:38,126
There's a piece that goes from this wall
to the corner and a piece from this corner

37
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:41,584
to the other wall.
So this piece here, well that's really the

38
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:45,868
hypotenuse of a right triangle, whose
opposite side to this angle theta has

39
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,937
length a.
And that means this hypotenuse has length

40
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:54,996
a times co-secant theta.
Similarly here I got a right triangle and

41
00:02:54,996 --> 00:03:01,068
I have got this side length here is b so,
the hypotenuse has length b times secant

42
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:06,496
theta and the stick is just the sum of
these two lengths so that gives me a

43
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:12,546
formula for l in terms of theta.
L is a cosecant theta plus b secant theta.

44
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:18,577
What's the constraint in this problem?
Yeah I only need to think about theta

45
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:24,721
being between 0 and pi over 2 in order to
touch these two walls and the corner.

46
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:29,749
So now we've got a function, and it's
function of a single variable so we can

47
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:33,357
apply calculus.
So, I'm going to differentiate this

48
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:37,421
function, right, the derivative of L with
respect to theta.

49
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:42,759
Well what's the derivative of cosecant?
That's minus cosecant theta cotangent

50
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,746
theta.
And what's the derivative of secant?

51
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:50,816
Well that's secant theta Tangent theta.
So that's the derivative of l minus a

52
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:55,223
cosecant theta cotangent theta plus b
secant theta tangent theta.

53
00:03:55,223 --> 00:04:00,206
With the derivative in hand I can now try
to find the critical points for this

54
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,569
function.
Now since this function L is

55
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,261
differentiable on the domain that we're
considering, I don't have to worry about

56
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:11,938
places where L fails to be differentiable
when I'm looking for critical points.

57
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:15,680
I only need to find points where the
derivative is equal to zero.

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,741
So for which values of theta does this
thing vanish?

59
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:24,696
Well, let's write this as an equation
equal to 0, and let's add a cosecant theta

60
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:30,081
contangent theta to both sides.
So then I've got b secant theta tangent

61
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:34,068
theta is equal to a cosecant theta
cotangent theta.

62
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:40,554
I, I will divide both sides by co-secant
theta, cotangent theta and I will divide

63
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:46,986
both sides by b so that I have got secant
theta, tangent theta divided by cosecant

64
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,577
theta, cotangent theta is equal to a over
b.

65
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:55,832
Now what do I notice here?
Well dividing by cotangent is as good as

66
00:04:55,832 --> 00:05:00,771
multiplying by tangent.
And secant and co-secant is actually

67
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:04,666
tangent again.
So this is in fact tangent cubed.

68
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:09,425
So I've got tangent cubed theta.
Is equal to A over B.

69
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:17,559
If I take a cubed route now, I get that
tangent theta is equal to the cube root of

70
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:22,512
A over B.
In over words, theta is arc tangent the

71
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:28,617
cube root of A over B.
So now I know what theta is, but I don't

72
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:33,673
care about theta.
What I really care about is L.

73
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,826
What's the length?
So let's evaluate l of theta at the

74
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,790
critical point.
Now, where's the critical point?

75
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,518
It's where tangent of theta is equal to
the cube root of a over b.

76
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:48,210
I can build a right triangle with an angle
whose tangent is the cube root of a over

77
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,608
b.
I do that as follows.

78
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:53,110
I make this length 1.
And this length the cube root of a over b

79
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,206
and that makes the tangent of theta which
is this divided by this equal to this

80
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:01,440
right and this is 1 in the denominator.
That is the right triangle which means I

81
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,815
can compute the length of hypotenuse
right.

82
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:08,045
The length of hypotenuse is a square root
of the sum of these two lengths squared

83
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,571
and that's what I had written.
And here.

84
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:15,650
Okay, so I've got a right triangle.
I've got an angle whose tangent is theta

85
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,193
and I'm trying to calculate L of theta.
And if you remember back L was defined in

86
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:25,997
terms of cosecant and secant.
And I can compute cosecant and secant for

87
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:31,277
this angle theta whose tangent is this
quantity by reading off the cosecant and

88
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:36,164
secant from this triangle.
So the co-secant remember is a one over

89
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:41,926
sine which means it's hypotenuse divided
by the opposite side length and that's

90
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:47,344
what I got here, length by hypotenuse
divided by length of opposite side and

91
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:52,504
secant, remember is one over cosine so
that means it's the side length by

92
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:56,456
hypotenuse divided by this length, which
is just one.

93
00:06:56,456 --> 00:07:02,762
Now once I know cosecant and secant in
terms of this quantity here, I can then

94
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:08,245
evaluate L at that quantity.
So here we go, this is what I get when I

95
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:12,623
plug in these quantities for coseekit, and
seekit.

96
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:15,207
Get.
Now this looks terrible, right?

97
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:19,837
Well, I can simplify this a little bit.
What do you notice here?

98
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:24,989
I've got a dividing by the cubert of B in
the denominator, which is as good as

99
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:30,260
putting a B to the thirds power up here.
And here I'm going to separate out this B

100
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,572
to B a B to the two thirds times B to the
one third and move that inside the square

101
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:38,821
root.
The upshot is that this thing is in fact

102
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:43,417
the same as this thing here.
And now this begins to be a little bit

103
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:47,719
more symmetric, right?
I took the a and the cube root of a and

104
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,999
that gave me the a to the 2 3rds and by
putting a b to the 2 3rds inside here, I

105
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,951
made this look a lot, a lot nicer.
Okay.

106
00:07:55,951 --> 00:08:01,227
Now I've got a common factor of the square
root of b to the 2 3rds plus a to the 2

107
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:06,371
3rds here and I can collect that out.
So now I've got a to the 2 3rds plus b to

108
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:11,153
the 2 3rds times the square root of b to
the 2 3rds plus a to the 2 3rds.

109
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:15,674
Now this is the same thing, here.
It's this thing times the square root that

110
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:18,377
thing.
And another way of saying that is just

111
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:23,210
this quantity to the 3/2 power, right?
This is this quantity to the first power,

112
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,765
times the 1/2 power, and that gives me the
3/2 power, here.

113
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:31,824
So, at the critical point, l of theta is
equal to this quantity.

114
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:38,358
Now with a bit more work, we can show that
this quantity is in fact the minimum value

115
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:41,116
of l.
We can summarize our answer.

116
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:46,400
So given a hallway of width A meeting a
hallway of width B at some corner, what

117
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,546
we've shown is that a stick of length at
most, A to the two thirds plus B to the

118
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:57,107
two thirds, that quantity to the three
halves power can be navigated around that

119
00:08:57,107 --> 00:09:00,731
corner.
And we can see this playing out in action.

120
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:05,016
I made a model that you can download Well
here is an example.

121
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:09,558
I've got a hallway of width 64
millimeters, that's a pretty small

122
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:13,324
hallway, right?
And I've got another hallway here, 27

123
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:17,260
millimeters.
And the calculation that we've done tells

124
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,904
us that a stick of length 125 millimeters
will just be able to turnaround, this

125
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:24,730
hallway.
So let's see.

126
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,397
Here's the stick and I start the stick
moving down the hallway, right?

127
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:34,763
And I start trying to rotate it around and
eventually I'm going to bump up against

128
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:40,123
the corner , but I'll just be able to make
it around the corner and then I'll be able

129
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:44,691
to move it out of the hallway.
Perhaps you're wondering where those

130
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:48,456
numbers came from.
Well here's where I got these numbers

131
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,439
from, right?
64 and 27, these are the widths of my

132
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:56,175
hallways and this is the formula that
tells us the largest stick that can pass

133
00:09:56,175 --> 00:10:00,886
through a hallway of these two widths.
Now I chose 64 and 27 for, maybe two

134
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:04,760
different reasons.
One thing is that these are both perfect

135
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,607
cubes.
So, 64 to the one third power is 4 and 27

136
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:14,245
to the one third power is 3.
The other thing that's nice about these

137
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:21,316
numbers is that 4 squared plus 3 squared
is 5 squared, right?

138
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:28,846
These are Pythagorean triple.
And 5 squared to the 1/2 is just 5.

139
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:32,145
So it's 5 cubed which is 125.
