in
our
calculus
class
so
far
,
some
of
the
applications
have
involved
sheep
trapped
inside
fences
and
ladders
leaning
up
against
buildings
.
well
,
here
's
a
scene
that
combines
all
these
things
.
i
've
got
a
sheep
,
i
've
got
a
fence
,
i
've
got
a
ladder
.
here
's
a
really
tall
barn
.
here
's
the
sun
shining
down
on
the
ground
.
let
's
suppose
that
you
're
the
sheep
,
stuck
behind
the
fence
,
but
eager
to
get
to
the
barn
.
the
really
good
news
is
that
you
're
not
just
a
regular
sheep
,
you
're
some
sort
of
ninja
sheep
.
and
you
've
got
a
supply
of
a
bunch
of
different
ladders
.
the
question
is
,
what
's
the
shortest
ladder
that
you
can
use
?
you
want
to
pick
the
shortest
ladder
that
you
can
get
away
with
,
which
goes
over
the
fence
and
touches
the
barn
.
i
mean
,
if
the
ladder
is
too
short
,
it
wo
n't
even
go
over
the
fence
.
but
,
even
this
longer
ladder
,
i
mean
,
it
will
get
you
over
the
fence
,
but
this
ladder
is
not
long
enough
yet
to
get
you
all
the
way
to
the
barn
.
at
this
point
,
you
're
probably
feeling
really
bad
.
you
now
recognize
that
this
is
an
optimization
problem
,
but
you
're
thinking
,
oh
no
,
not
again
.
not
another
optimization
problem
.
well
,
let
me
say
a
little
more
about
exactly
how
tall
the
fence
is
,
and
how
far
it
is
from
the
barn
.
let
's
say
that
,
that
fence
is
6.4
meters
tall
.
and
let
's
say
that
the
fence
is
2.7
meters
from
the
barn
.
is
something
sounding
familiar
here
?
yeah
,
we
've
seen
numbers
like
64
and
27
come
up
before
.
we
saw
them
in
that
hallway
problem
,
right
?
what
did
i
want
to
do
in
the
hallway
problem
?
i
wanted
to
take
some
stick
and
figure
out
what
the
,
in
this
case
,
longest
stick
was
that
i
could
navigate
through
this
hallway
.
but
as
,
remember
,
the
issue
was
finding
the
shortest
stick
which
simultaneously
touched
this
bottom
wall
,
this
wall
here
in
the
corner
.
that
's
really
the
exact
same
problem
.
we
just
have
to
think
about
this
problem
in
,
in
different
terms
.
instead
of
thinking
of
this
as
a
wall
,
i
think
of
this
as
the
ground
.
instead
of
thinking
of
this
is
a
wall
,
i
think
of
this
as
the
side
of
the
barn
.
and
i
want
to
pass
through
this
point
.
i
want
to
touch
this
corner
,
which
really
just
means
i
want
to
clear
the
fence
,
you
know
?
and
because
this
problem
happened
to
be
solved
by
a
stick
of
length
125
millimeters
,
this
problem
is
going
to
be
solved
by
a
ladder
of
length
12.5
meters
.
and
here
,
and
this
drawing
is
actually
to
scale
so
i
can
,
i
can
really
demonstrate
it
,
you
know
?
here
,
i
position
the
ladder
and
yeah
,
this
,
this
ladder
is
in
fact
long
enough
to
touch
the
ground
,
the
barn
,
and
just
clear
the
fence
.
we
've
done
a
ton
of
stuff
this
week
,
but
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
lesson
of
all
.
at
it
's
core
,
mathematics
is
not
about
just
solving
problems
.
what
we
've
done
here
is
realize
an
analogy
between
two
seemingly
different
problems
,
alright
?
the
problem
of
a
stick
turning
a
corner
and
a
ladder
clearing
a
fence
.
more
than
about
solving
problems
,
mathematics
is
really
about
these
kinds
of
analogies
,
about
being
able
to
recognize
that
things
that
look
different
are
really
the
same
.
people
have
been
doing
mathematics
for
thousands
of
years
,
and
there
's
been
a
ton
of
new
mathematics
developed
in
that
time
.
so
,
you
might
think
that
with
all
the
new
mathematics
,
that
mathematics
would
be
constantly
splintering
off
and
fracturing
into
different
subjects
.
but
that
's
not
what
's
happened
at
all
.
this
desire
to
analogize
,
to
unify
.
to
see
different
parts
of
the
elephant
as
the
same
elephant
,
right
?
this
tendency
has
really
kept
mathematics
together
.
it
means
that
mathematics
does
n't
appear
as
a
bunch
of
separate
subjects
,
it
really
appears
as
a
unified
whole
.
