music in calculus class so far, 
applications involved sheep 
trapped inside fences ladders leaning 
buildings 
well, heres a scene that combines 
things 
ive got a sheep, ive got a fence, ive 
got a ladder 
heres a really tall barn 
heres sun shining ground 
lets suppose that youre sheep, stuck 
behind fence, eager to get to 
barn 
really good news is that youre 
a regular sheep, youre sort 
ninja sheep 
youve got a supply a bunch 
different ladders 
question is, whats shortest 
ladder that you use 
you want to pick shortest ladder that 
you get away with, goes 
fence touches barn 
i mean, if ladder is short, 
wont even go fence 
but, even this longer ladder, i mean, 
will get you fence, this 
ladder is long enough yet to get you 
way to barn 
this point, youre probably feeling 
really bad 
you recognize that this is an 
optimization problem, youre thinking, 
oh no, 
another optimization problem 
well, let say a little 
exactly tall fence is, far 
is barn 
lets say that, that fence is meters 
tall 
lets say that fence is meters 
barn 
is something sounding familiar here 
yeah, weve seen numbers like 
come 
we saw in that hallway problem, 
right 
i want to in hallway 
problem 
i wanted to take stick figure 
the, in this case, longest stick 
that i could navigate this 
hallway 
as, remember, issue finding 
shortest stick simultaneously 
touched this bottom wall, this wall here 
in corner 
thats really exact problem 
we to think this problem 
in, in different terms 
instead thinking this a wall, i 
think this ground 
instead thinking this is a wall, i 
think this side barn 
i want to pass this point 
i want to touch this corner, really 
means i want to clear fence, you 
know 
this problem happened to 
solved a stick length 
millimeters, this problem is going to 
solved a ladder length meters 
here, this drawing is actually to 
scale so i can, i really demonstrate 
it, you know 
here, i position ladder yeah, 
this, this ladder is in fact long enough 
to touch ground, barn, 
clear fence 
weve done a ton stuff this week, 
this is perhaps important lesson 

core, mathematics is 
solving problems 
weve done here is realize an analogy 
between two seemingly different problems, 
alright 
problem a stick turning a corner 
a ladder clearing a fence 
solving problems, 
mathematics is really kinds 
analogies, able to recognize 
that things that look different really 

people mathematics 
thousands years, theres a ton 
new mathematics developed in that time 
so, you might think that new 
mathematics, that mathematics would 
constantly splintering fracturing 
different subjects 
thats whats happened 
this desire to analogize, to unify 
to see different parts elephant 
elephant, right 
this tendency really kept mathematics 
together 
means that mathematics doesnt appear 
a bunch separate subjects, really 
appears a unified whole
