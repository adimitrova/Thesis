subject
to
some
conditions
functions
are
guaranteed
to
have
maximum
and
minimum
values
here
is
the
extreme
value
thery
it
says
that
if
a
function
f
is
continuous
under
closed
.
interval
a
,
b
,
then
the
function
attains
a
maximum
value
and
the
function
attains
a
minimum
value
.
if
you
do
n't
like
this
,
you
can
make
it
a
little
bit
more
precise
.
here
's
a
slightly
more
precise
statement
of
the
extreme
value
theorem
.
it
says
:
``
if
a
function
f
is
continuous
on
the
closed
interval
a
,
b
,
''
then
this
is
really
just
making
clear
what
i
mean
by
,
``
attains
a
maximum
value
and
attains
a
minimum
value
.
''
all
right
?
what
i
really
mean
is
that
there
's
some
point
,
c
and
d
in
this
interval
so
that
no
matter
what
other
value
i
pick
in
that
interval
,
f
of
c
is
less
than
or
equal
to
that
other
value
,
and
f
of
d
is
bigger
than
that
other
value
.
so
f
of
c
is
the
minimum
value
.
c
is
where
f
achieves
that
minimum
value
.
and
f
of
d
is
that
maximum
value
.
d
is
where
the
function
achieves
that
maximum
value
.
the
extreme
value
theorem
promises
us
that
these
extreme
values
exist
,
but
it
does
n't
tell
us
how
to
find
those
extreme
values
.
i
mean
,
you
could
have
a
complicated
looking
but
continuous
function
on
the
closed
interval
between
a
and
b.
and
it
might
be
hard
to
actually
determine
where
the
maximum
value
occurs
,
but
the
extreme
value
theorem
tells
you
that
the
maximum
value
is
achieved
somewhere
on
that
closed
interval
.
nevertheless
,
even
in
that
example
,
there
are
extreme
values
,
it
's
just
hard
to
find
them
.
now
maybe
that
all
seems
obvious
.
one
way
to
understand
the
extreme
value
theorem
is
to
try
to
break
it
.
try
to
mess
with
it
someone
and
see
if
it
still
works
.
this
is
sort
of
the
car
method
to
doing
science
,
right
?
if
i
'm
studying
cars
and
i
want
to
know
what
's
important
to
making
a
car
go
.
well
,
i
used
to
just
take
off
the
wheels
and
then
see
if
the
car
still
works
.
does
n't
work
so
well
,
right
?
the
fact
that
the
car
does
n't
work
when
i
break
the
car
's
wheels
off
tells
me
that
the
wheels
are
important
for
the
car
,
right
?
same
game
with
this
theorem
.
i
want
to
figure
out
what
the
important
parts
of
this
theorem
are
so
i
'm
going
to
try
to
break
this
theorem
in
various
ways
and
if
the
theorem
does
n't
after
i
break
it
,
well
that
must
have
been
an
important
part
of
the
theorem
.
what
if
,
for
instance
,
we
were
studying
a
function
on
the
domain
zero
to
infinity
including
zero
.
so
,
yeah
,
what
if
instead
of
closed
interval
between
these
two
numbers
a
and
b
,
i
'll
have
infinity
be
one
of
those
numbers
.
then
of
course
,
then
i
have
to
make
that
an
open
parenthesis
there
.
so
if
a
function
's
just
continuous
on
the
interval
between
zero
and
infinity
including
zero
,
does
that
mean
that
it
actually
achieves
its
maximum
minimum
values
?
well
no
think
about
this
example
the
function
f
of
x
equals
x
define
on
that
interval
this
function
does
not
achieve
a
maximum
value
.
if
you
tell
me
that
some
number
is
the
maximum
output
of
this
vunction
i
'm
just
going
to
add
one
to
wahtever
you
say
and
that
'll
be
a
bigger
to
this
function
.
this
function
does
not
acheive
it
's
maxium
output
at
given
input
.
what
if
we
were
studying
a
function
on
a
domain
that
was
an
open
interval
?
yeah
,
so
what
if
instead
of
closed
interval
,
i
just
said
open
interval
between
these
two
numbers
a
and
b
?
well
then
the
function
would
not
be
guaranteed
to
have
a
maximum
or
minimum
value
,
then
take
a
look
at
this
.
here
is
an
example
of
a
continuous
function
defined
at
an
open
interval
minus
pi
over
2
and
pi
over
2
and
this
function
does
not
achieve
a
maximum
or
minimum
value
on
this
interval
.
i
can
make
tangent
as
positive
or
as
negative
as
i
'd
like
by
choosing
x
close
enough
to
one
of
these
end
points
.
what
if
i
try
to
mess
up
the
extreme
value
theorem
by
eliminating
the
condition
at
the
function
being
continuous
.
so
yeah
,
what
if
i
break
the
statement
of
the
extreme
value
theorem
by
removing
the
continuity
equation
because
i
'm
not
required
the
function
be
continuous
anymore
.
so
,
if
it
's
just
some
function
that
's
defined
on
a
close
interval
between
a
and
b
,
does
it
guarantee
the
function
that
choose
the
maximum
and
minimum
value
.
no
.
here
's
an
example
.
here
's
a
picture
of
a
graph
of
a
discontinuous
function
and
it
's
defined
in
the
closed
interval
between
a
and
b
,
but
here
you
can
see
that
it
's
approaching
some
value
but
never
achieving
that
value
and
here
it
's
approaching
some
value
but
never
achieving
that
value
.
so
this
function
does
not
actually
attain
its
maximum
and
minimum
value
on
this
interval
.
to
get
a
better
sense
of
what
's
going
on
,
here
's
a
much
fancier
way
to
talk
about
the
possible
output
values
of
a
function
.
so
let
's
write
i
to
represent
some
interval
.
it
could
be
the
open
interval
between
a
and
b
,
the
close
interval
between
a
and
b
,
whatever
,
right
?
i
is
just
a
set
of
numbers
.
what
's
f
of
a
collection
of
numbers
?
what
does
that
even
mean
?
well
this
is
the
collection
of
all
the
output
values
if
the
input
is
in
i.
so
f
of
i
is
the
set
,
or
collection
,
of
all
the
f
of
xs
whenever
x
is
some
point
in
the
set
i.
and
people
sometimes
call
this
the
image
of
i.
we
can
use
this
terminology
to
rephrase
what
we
've
been
talking
about
.
for
example
,
the
continuous
image
of
a
bounded
interval
,
a
bounded
interval
like
this
interval
between
2
numbers
,
need
not
be
bounded
.
here
's
an
explicit
example
that
we
've
already
seen
,
take
a
look
at
this
continuous
function
,
function
,
tangent
of
x.
then
we
look
at
the
continuous
function
.
remember
to
look
at
the
image
of
some
interval
.
here
is
a
interval
.
and
what
's
the
output
of
this
function
if
the
input
is
between
minus
pi
over
2
,
and
pi
over
2.
well
,
the
output
can
be
anything
.
alright
?
so
f
of
i
is
all
real
numbers
.
so
even
though
i
'm
starting
with
things
that
are
n't
very
big
.
the
output
is
as
big
or
as
small
as
i
'd
like
it
to
be
.
what
it
that
bounded
interval
is
also
closed
?
a
much
fancier
way
of
stating
the
extreme
value
theorem
is
to
state
this
result
.
that
the
continuous
image
of
a
closed
bounded
interval
is
a
closed
bounded
interval
.
you
can
really
try
this
for
yourself
.
you
write
down
some
crazy
continues
function
so
who
knows
what
this
continues
function
might
be
some
continues
function
and
some
interval
which
i
'll
call
i
.
>
>
between
two
numbers
a
and
b.
so
it
's
bounded
because
a
and
b
are
numbers
,
right
,
and
it
's
closed
because
i
'm
using
the
square
brackets
.
and
then
what
i
want
to
think
is
what
is
all
the
outputs
whenever
the
input
is
in
i.
well
this
is
going
to
be
the
closed
interval
.
right
,
what
's
the
smallest
value
,
what
's
the
minimum
value
that
the
function
achieves
?
and
the
biggest
output
is
just
going
to
be
whatever
the
maximum
value
is
that
this
function
achieves
.
so
this
statement
that
,
continuous
image
of
a
closed
,
bounded
interval
is
a
closed
,
bounded
interval
is
really
getting
at
the
same
idea
.
it
's
the
extreme
value
theorem
,
saying
if
you
start
with
a
continuous
function
on
some
closed
,
bounded
interval
then
the
ouptputs
are
going
to
be
between
.
including
the
minimum
and
maximum
value
.
and
the
fact
that
these
are
square
brackets
here
.
the
fact
that
these
are
closed
interval
are
crucial
.
because
i
'm
telling
you
that
the
minimum
value
is
actually
achieved
.
and
the
maximum
value
is
actually
achieved
.
this
way
of
talking
is
also
useful
for
something
like
the
intermediate
value
theorum
.
so
,
yeah
.
you
could
say
it
's
true
that
the
continuous
image
of
an
interval
is
an
interval
.
so
if
you
take
an
interval
and
you
pick
your
favorite
continuous
function
,
f
of
that
interval
is
just
some
other
interval
.
that
's
the
same
as
saying
that
over
values
in-between
are
achieved
and
that
's
really
what
the
intermediate
value
theory
is
getting
at
.
this
is
just
a
very
succinct
way
of
stating
the
intermediate
value
theorem
.
the
upshot
here
is
that
we
're
seeing
there
's
something
really
special
about
continuity
.
so
here
again
is
the
extreme
value
fare
i
mean
what
we
've
learned
is
that
continuity
is
really
important
.
if
someone
just
shows
you
some
function
that
's
not
continuous
do
n't
expect
that
you
're
going
to
be
able
to
find
any
extreme
values
they
might
not
exist
.
it
's
also
really
important
that
this
is
about
closed
interval
between
two
numbers
alright
a
closed
and
bound
interval
and
that
's
really
important
and
if
you
're
being
asked
to
find
maximum
minimum
values
not
on
a
closed
interval
say
you
should
n't
expect
that
they
necessary
exist
.
they
might
not
be
there
.
so
this
theorem
's
going
to
help
guide
you
towards
the
correct
answer
because
it
tells
you
what
sort
of
answer
to
expect
.
