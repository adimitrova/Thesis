welcome back to calculus one, welcome 
to week eight time together 
last week, week seven, we began 
studying applications derivative 
we focused in related rates 
problems 
so surprising, i think that 
calculus solve related rates 
problems 
calculus is things 
change, so makes sense that you could 
use calculus to study things 
changing together 
this week, in week eight, we focus 
optimization problems 
optimization problems 
best something, right 
you want to find shape a soup 
that maximizes amount soup a 
given amount metal 
you want to find shape 
rectangular fence that encloses 
area a given length fence 
you want to find shape 
rectangular fence that encloses 
area a given length fence 
you want to understand bubbles form 
shapes that light 
travels paths that 
right 
problems finding 
best something thats really 
different in related rates problems 
right 
asking something 
changes, im actually trying to find a 
point function achieves a 
maximum a minimum value 
i think is really surprising that 
calculus, fundamentally, is 
things change also used 
to solve that problem 
also used to find a specific 
value something really exiting happens 
i also want to say thank you 
is a long difficult course, 
youve made now, half way 

congratulations
