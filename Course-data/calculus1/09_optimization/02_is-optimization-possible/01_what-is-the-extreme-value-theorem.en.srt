1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,877
[music] Subject to some conditions
functions are guaranteed to have maximum

2
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:15,621
and minimum values here is the extreme
value thery it says that if a function F

3
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:21,127
is continuous under closed.
Interval a, b, then the function attains a

4
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,548
maximum value and the function attains a
minimum value.

5
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:28,446
If you don't like this, you can make it a
little bit more precise.

6
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:32,706
Here's a slightly more precise statement
of the extreme value theorem.

7
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:37,464
It says: "If a function f is continuous on
the closed interval a, b," then this is

8
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:42,144
really just making clear what I mean by,
"attains a maximum value and attains a

9
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:47,005
minimum value." All right?
What I really mean is that there's some

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:53,213
point, c and d In this interval so that no
matter what other value I pick in that

11
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:59,227
interval, f of c is less than or equal to
that other value, and f of d is bigger

12
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:03,777
than that other value.
So f of c is the minimum value.

13
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:10,066
C is where f achieves that minimum value.
And f of d is that maximum value.

14
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,900
D is where the function achieves that
maximum value.

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,098
The extreme value theorem promises us that
these extreme values exist, but it doesn't

16
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:25,642
tell us how to find those extreme values.
I mean, you could have a complicated

17
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:30,885
looking but continuous function on the
closed interval between a and b.

18
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:36,626
And it might be hard to actually determine
where the maximum value occurs, but the

19
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:42,187
Extreme Value Theorem tells you that the
maximum value is achieved somewhere on

20
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:46,843
that closed interval.
Nevertheless, even in that example, there

21
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:50,216
are extreme values, it's just hard to find
them.

22
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:55,109
Now maybe that all seems obvious.
One way to understand the extreme value

23
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,654
theorem is to try to break it.
Try to mess with it someone and see if it

24
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:03,049
still works.
This is sort of the car method to doing

25
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,704
science, right?
If I'm studying cars and I want to know

26
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:11,366
what's important to making a car go.
Well, I used to just take off the wheels

27
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,701
and then see if the car still works.
Doesn't work so well, right?

28
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,733
The fact that the car doesn't work when I
break the car's wheels off tells me that

29
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,041
the wheels are important for the car,
right?

30
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,408
Same game with this theorem.
I want to figure out what the important

31
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:28,373
parts of this theorem are so I'm going to
try to break this theorem in various ways

32
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,460
and if the theorem doesn't after I break
it, well that must have been an important

33
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,300
part of the theorem.
What if, for instance, we were studying a

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,927
function on the domain zero to infinity
including zero.

35
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,784
So, yeah, what if instead of closed
interval between these two numbers a and

36
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,773
b, I'll have infinity be one of those
numbers.

37
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:52,316
Then of course, then I have to make that
an open parenthesis there.

38
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:57,186
So if a function's just continuous on the
interval between zero and infinity

39
00:02:57,186 --> 00:03:02,126
including zero, does that mean that it
actually achieves its maximum minimum

40
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,092
values?
Well no think about this example the

41
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:10,372
function F of X equals X define on that
interval this function does not achieve a

42
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,947
maximum value.
If you tell me that some number is the

43
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:19,131
maximum output of this vunction I'm just
going to add one to wahtever you say and

44
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:24,572
that'll be a bigger to this function.
This function does not acheive it's maxium

45
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:28,298
output at given input.
What if we were studying a function on a

46
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:32,146
domain that was an open interval?
Yeah, so what if instead of closed

47
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:36,189
interval, I just said open interval
between these two numbers a and b?

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,830
Well then the function would not be
guaranteed to have a maximum or minimum

49
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,873
value, then take a look at this.
Here is an example of a continuous

50
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:49,905
function defined at an open interval minus
pi over 2 and pi over 2 and this function

51
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:53,691
does not achieve a maximum or minimum
value on this interval.

52
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:58,285
I can make tangent as positive or as
negative as I'd like by choosing x close

53
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:02,826
enough to one of these end points.
What if I try to mess up the extreme value

54
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:07,337
theorem by eliminating the condition at
the function being continuous.

55
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:11,500
So yeah, what if I break the statement of
the extreme value theorem by removing the

56
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,038
continuity equation because I'm not
required the function be continuous

57
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,472
anymore.
So, if it's just some function that's

58
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:21,498
defined on a close interval between a and
b, does it guarantee the function that

59
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,929
choose the maximum and minimum value.
No.

60
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:27,071
Here's an example.
Here's a picture of a graph of a

61
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:32,391
discontinuous function and it's defined in
the closed interval between a and b, but

62
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:37,483
here you can see that it's approaching
some value but never achieving that value

63
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:42,010
and here it's approaching some value but
never achieving that value.

64
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,032
So this function does not Actually attain
its maximum and minimum value on this

65
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,211
interval.
To get a better sense of what's going on,

66
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:55,213
here's a much fancier way to talk about
the possible output values of a function.

67
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,954
So let's write I to represent some
interval.

68
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:02,844
It could be the open interval between a
and b, the close interval between a and b,

69
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,750
whatever, right?
I is just a set of numbers.

70
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:10,266
What's f of a collection of numbers?
What does that even mean?

71
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:15,411
Well this is the collection of all the
output values if the input is in I.

72
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:20,846
So f of I is the set, or collection, of
all the f of xs whenever x is some point

73
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:24,696
in the set I.
And people sometimes call this the image

74
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:27,572
of I.
We can use this terminology to rephrase

75
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:31,662
what we've been talking about.
For example, the continuous image of a

76
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:36,632
bounded interval, a bounded interval like
this interval between 2 numbers, need not

77
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:39,689
be bounded.
Here's an explicit example that we've

78
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:44,162
already seen, take a look at this
continuous function, Function, tangent of

79
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,712
X.
Then we look at the continuous function.

80
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,458
Remember to look at the image of some
interval.

81
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,027
Here is a interval.
And what's the output of this function if

82
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,957
the input is between minus pi over 2, and
pi over 2.

83
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,780
Well, the output can be anything.
Alright?

84
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,264
So f of i is all real numbers.
So even though I'm starting with things

85
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:07,143
that aren't very big.
The output is as big or as small as I'd

86
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:10,499
like it to be.
What it that bounded interval is also

87
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:13,732
closed?
A much fancier way of stating the extreme

88
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:18,716
value theorem is to state this result.
That the continuous image of a closed

89
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:21,993
bounded interval is a closed bounded
interval.

90
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:27,128
You can really try this for yourself.
You write down some crazy continues

91
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:32,879
function so who knows what this continues
function might be some continues function

92
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,507
and some interval which I'll call I.
>> Between two numbers A and B.

93
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:41,667
So it's bounded because A and B are
numbers, right, and it's closed because

94
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,539
I'm using the square brackets.
And then what I want to think is what is

95
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,951
all the outputs whenever the input is in
I.

96
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,522
Well this is going to be the closed
interval.

97
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:55,077
Right, what's the smallest value, what's
the minimum value that the function

98
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,936
achieves?
And the biggest output is just going to be

99
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:01,420
whatever the maximum value is that this
function achieves.

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,536
So this statement that, continuous image
of a closed, bounded interval is a closed,

101
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,633
bounded interval is really getting at the
same idea.

102
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:14,399
It's the extreme value theorem, saying if
you start with a continuous function on

103
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,736
some closed, bounded interval Then the
ouptputs are going to be between.

104
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:22,900
Including the minimum and maximum value.
And the fact that these are square

105
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,981
brackets here.
The fact that these are closed interval

106
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,947
are crucial.
Because I'm telling you that the minimum

107
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:32,423
value is actually achieved.
And the maximum value is actually

108
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:35,078
achieved.
This way of talking is also useful for

109
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,924
something like the intermediate value
theorum.

110
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,468
So, yeah.
You could say it's true that the

111
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:43,292
continuous image of an interval is an
interval.

112
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:47,783
So if you take an interval and you pick
your favorite continuous function, f of

113
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:52,742
that interval is just some other interval.
That's the same as saying that over values

114
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:57,366
in-between are achieved and that's really
what the intermediate value theory is

115
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,101
getting at.
This is just a very succinct way of

116
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:04,762
stating the intermediate value theorem.
The upshot here is that we're seeing

117
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:07,821
there's something really special about
continuity.

118
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,519
So here again is the extreme value fare I
mean what we've learned is that continuity

119
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,052
is really important.
If someone just shows you some function

120
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:20,132
that's not continuous don't expect that
you're going to be able to find any

121
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,937
extreme values they might not exist.
It's also really important that this is

122
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:30,112
about closed interval between two numbers
alright a closed and bound interval and

123
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:35,212
that's really important and if you're
being asked to find maximum minimum values

124
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:40,285
not on a closed interval say you shouldn't
expect that they necessary exist.

125
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:47,558
They might not be there.
So this theorem's going to help guide you

126
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:56,581
towards the correct answer because it
tells you what sort of answer to expect.
