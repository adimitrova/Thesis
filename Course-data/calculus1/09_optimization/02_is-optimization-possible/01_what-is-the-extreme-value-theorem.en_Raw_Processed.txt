music subject to conditions 
functions guaranteed to maximum 
minimum values here is extreme 
value thery says that if a function f 
is continuous closed 
interval a, b, function attains a 
maximum value function attains a 
minimum value 
if you dont like this, you make a 
little bit precise 
heres a slightly precise statement 
extreme value theorem 
says if a function f is continuous 
closed interval a, b, this is 
really making clear i mean by, 
attains a maximum value attains a 
minimum value right 
i really mean is that theres 
point, c d in this interval so that 
matter value i pick in that 
interval, f c is less equal to 
that value, f d is bigger 
that value 
so f c is minimum value 
c is f achieves that minimum value 
f d is that maximum value 
d is function achieves that 
maximum value 
extreme value theorem promises us that 
extreme values exist, doesnt 
tell us to find extreme values 
i mean, you could a complicated 
looking continuous function 
closed interval between a b 
might hard to actually determine 
maximum value occurs, 
extreme value theorem tells you that 
maximum value is achieved somewhere 
that closed interval 
nevertheless, even in that example, there 
extreme values, hard to find 

maybe that seems obvious 
one way to understand extreme value 
theorem is to try to break 
try to mess someone see if 
still works 
this is sort car method to 
science, right 
if im studying cars i want to know 
whats important to making a car go 
well, i used to take wheels 
see if car still works 
doesnt work so well, right 
fact that car doesnt work i 
break cars wheels tells that 
wheels important car, 
right 
game this theorem 
i want to figure important 
parts this theorem so im going to 
try to break this theorem in various ways 
if theorem doesnt i break 
it, well that must an important 
part theorem 
if, instance, we studying a 
function domain zero to infinity 
including zero 
so, yeah, if instead closed 
interval between two numbers a 
b, ill infinity one 
numbers 
course, i to make that 
an open parenthesis there 
so if a functions continuous 
interval between zero infinity 
including zero, that mean that 
actually achieves maximum minimum 
values 
well think this example 
function f x equals x define that 
interval this function achieve a 
maximum value 
if you tell that number is 
maximum output this vunction im 
going to add one to wahtever you say 
thatll a bigger to this function 
this function acheive maxium 
output given input 
if we studying a function a 
domain that an open interval 
yeah, so if instead closed 
interval, i said open interval 
between two numbers a b 
well function would 
guaranteed to a maximum minimum 
value, take a look this 
here is an example a continuous 
function defined an open interval minus 
pi pi this function 
achieve a maximum minimum 
value this interval 
i make tangent positive 
negative id like choosing x close 
enough to one end points 
if i try to mess extreme value 
theorem eliminating condition 
function continuous 
so yeah, if i break statement 
extreme value theorem removing 
continuity equation im 
required function continuous 
anymore 
so, if function thats 
defined a close interval between a 
b, guarantee function that 
choose maximum minimum value 

heres an example 
heres a picture a graph a 
discontinuous function defined in 
closed interval between a b, 
here you see that approaching 
value never achieving that value 
here approaching value 
never achieving that value 
so this function actually attain 
maximum minimum value this 
interval 
to get a better sense whats going on, 
heres a much fancier way to talk 
possible output values a function 
so lets write i to represent 
interval 
could open interval between a 
b, close interval between a b, 
whatever, right 
i is a set numbers 
whats f a collection numbers 
that even mean 
well this is collection 
output values if input is in i 
so f i is set, collection, 
f xs whenever x is point 
in set i 
people sometimes call this image 
i 
we use this terminology to rephrase 
weve talking 
example, continuous image a 
bounded interval, a bounded interval like 
this interval between numbers, need 
bounded 
heres an explicit example that weve 
already seen, take a look this 
continuous function, function, tangent 
x 
we look continuous function 
remember to look image 
interval 
here is a interval 
whats output this function if 
input is between minus pi , 
pi 
well, output anything 
alright 
so f i is real numbers 
so even though im starting things 
that arent big 
output is big small id 
like to 
that bounded interval is also 
closed 
a much fancier way stating extreme 
value theorem is to state this result 
that continuous image a closed 
bounded interval is a closed bounded 
interval 
you really try this 
you write crazy continues 
function so knows this continues 
function might continues function 
interval ill call i 
between two numbers a b 
so bounded a b 
numbers, right, closed 
im using square brackets 
i want to think is is 
outputs whenever input is in 
i 
well this is going to closed 
interval 
right, whats smallest value, whats 
minimum value that function 
achieves 
biggest output is going to 
whatever maximum value is that this 
function achieves 
so this statement that, continuous image 
a closed, bounded interval is a closed, 
bounded interval is really getting 
idea 
extreme value theorem, saying if 
you start a continuous function 
closed, bounded interval 
ouptputs going to between 
including minimum maximum value 
fact that square 
brackets here 
fact that closed interval 
crucial 
im telling you that minimum 
value is actually achieved 
maximum value is actually 
achieved 
this way talking is also useful 
something like intermediate value 
theorum 
so, yeah 
you could say true that 
continuous image an interval is an 
interval 
so if you take an interval you pick 
favorite continuous function, f 
that interval is interval 
thats saying that values 
inbetween achieved thats really 
intermediate value theory is 
getting 
this is a succinct way 
stating intermediate value theorem 
upshot here is that seeing 
theres something really special 
continuity 
so here is extreme value fare i 
mean weve learned is that continuity 
is really important 
if someone shows you function 
thats continuous dont expect that 
youre going to able to find 
extreme values might exist 
also really important that this is 
closed interval between two numbers 
alright a closed bound interval 
thats really important if youre 
asked to find maximum minimum values 
a closed interval say you shouldnt 
expect that necessary exist 
might there 
so this theorems going to help guide you 
towards correct answer 
tells you sort answer to expect
