lets suppose that you work a soup 
company, theyve given you a task, a 
task to design a soup that hold 
times pi cubic centimeters soup 
this is really an optimization problem 
goal is to design a soup using 
little metal possible, 
nevertheless holds pi cubic 
centimeters soup 
okay, less dramatically, youre really 
asked to produce a cylinder a 
given volume 
i want volume thing to 
pi cubic centimeters, i want you to 
minimize surface area, right 
this things got a side a top a 
bottom 
i want you to minimize surface 
area a given volume 
probably helps to review a little bit 
geometry that goes this problem 
heres a picture a cylinder right, 
got height that ill calling 
h a radius that ill call r 
volume this cylinder is pi r 
squared h 
right, pi r squared is area, 
im multiplying h to compute volume 
this disk dragged space 
whats surface area this cylinder 
well pi r squared counts surface 
area top disk bottom disk 
pi r squared 
area 
curved part this cylinder 
area pi r h 
okay, let draw a picture soup 

so, yeah, heres a little picture 
soup can, you see ive labeled 
relevant sizes 
height radius 
is im trying to figure 
is that im trying to 
optimize 
so im trying to minimize surface 
area 
heres that formula surface area 
this can, i want that surface area 
to small possible 
course, if i wanted to make that 
surface area small possible, i 
make a really tiny soup can, right 
theres a constraint 
well, constraint is that soup 
to hold pi cubic centimeters soup 
so im trying to make this quantity, 
surface area, small possible, 
subject to constraint that volume 
soup is in fact pi 
i also point that 
radius height better positive 
otherwise, kind nonsense 
this thing that im trying to optimize 
really involves two variables 
involves height also a radius 
yeah this is bad news, right 
quantity that im trying to minimize 
involves variables, involves r h 
calculus, weve setting up, 
works understanding a single 
variable changing affects something else 
so i need to rewrite this function two 
variables a function a single 
variable 
so, here we go, lets take this constraint 
lets solve h, right 
if i start that, well, h is 
pi pi r squared i cancel 
these, pis im left h is 
r squared 
so, a given radius, this is tall i 
need to make soup to guarantee 
that soup holds pi cubic 
centimeters soup 
now, ive got an equation h in 
terms r, i use this to rewrite 
thing im trying minimize in terms 
r 
so, here we go 
thing im trying to minimize is 
pi r squared plus pi r times h, h, 
in order to satisfy constraint, is 
r squared 
i simplify this a little bit 
further, right 
ive got an r an r squared here 
so i get rid this square get 
rid this r 
then, thing im trying to minimize 
is pi r squared plus pi times , 
is pi divided r 
so this is quantity that im trying to 
minimize 
that ive got this thing written a 
function a single variable, im really 
tempted to fifth step here 
apply calculus, right 
if i got a function a single variable, 
i could differentiate 
find critical points 
figure maxima minima 
occur 
we dive in to calculus side 
this problem, lets think 
creative solutions to soup 
issue 
example, heres a little model a 
situation 
heres sun, heres earth here is 
new plan soup cans, right 
really big radius, really tiny height, 
right 
even if r is you know, million miles, 
that make h small enough so that this 
soup contains exactly pi cubic 
centimeters soup 
laugh 
well, whats surface area in this 
case 
is this a really good choice a soup 
can, in, in terms surface area 
no, right 
if i make r really big, admittedly, this 
quantity, pi r, is 
measuring curved area, thatll end 
small 
right, pi r squared r is really 
big, this quantity, amount metal in 
top bottom is 
enormous right 
so this is a great choice soup 
cans 
so soup shaped like a giant 
pancake is a terrible idea 
if i went way 
here is a piece wire, if i made 
soup really long thin like 
this piece wire 
well, here is that long, thin wireshaped 
soup can, right 
even if i make radius cylinder 
small, if i make long enough, 
soup hold pi cubic 
centimeters soup, right 
question is, is this a really 
smart choice to minimize surface area, 
no, turns that if r is really small, 
thats really that helpful 
yeah, if r is really small, pi r 
squared is really small 
i dont need much metal top 
bottom soup 
pi r, is much 
metal is in curved part soup 
can, this quantity is going to 
enormous 
so really, we see that two things 
competing 
a small value r isnt really 
helpful, a really big value r isnt 
helpful 
so creative solutions didnt quite pan 

lets calculus 
okay, so im going to think this 
surface area a function a single 
variable, r, right 
here is, f r is pi r squared plus 
pi r, im going to 
differentiate, heres derivative 
right, i differentiate pi r squared 
to get pi r, i differentiate this 
number divided r 
well, r is negative r 
squared 
thats derivative 
i multiply pi 
so this, is derivative this 
now, i need to find critical points 
now, remember critical points are, 
right 
critical points derivative 
vanishes, derivative doesnt 
exist, right 
functions differentible 
this function, that differentible 
domain 
right 
you might worry r is equal to 
thats even in domain 
original function 
so i dont to worry that 
right, weve gotta figure out, 
is derivative equal to zero, so 
im trying to solve this 
ill add pi r squared to 
sides 
so pi r must pi r squared in 
that case 
ill multiply sides r squared, 
ill divide sides pi 
ill get r cubed is pi pi 
pis cancel, is , so 
r cubed must 
in words, r is cube root 
this is critical point 
that i found critical points, 
end points 
well, end points actually arent 
really valid in this situation 
one end points might r is 
equal to zero 
in that case, soup 
volume 
so i cant satisfy constraint 
thing happens h is equal to 
zero 
in that case, soup can, again, 
volume 
so i cant satisfy constraint 
so, i dont to worry end 
points, theyre in domain 
that im considering 
i to worry limiting 
behavior r is really big r is 
really small 
so, we actually already handled 
limiting behavior 
right 
weve already considered situation 
r is really small 
thats situation soup cans 
like a long, thin wire 
we checked, in that case surface 
area is enormous 
right 
if r is small enough, surface area 
large you like, still hold 
pi cubic centimeters soup 
we also consider situation r is 
really large, right 
r really big ,we this sort 
flat pancake shape soup 
in that case, we saw that if r 
is big enough, surface area 
made large you like, while still 
that soup contain pi cubic 
centimeters soup 
so, thing that really remains is 
this critical point 
if you plug this critical point 
original function, you get this 
resulting surface area, if you build 
soup a radius cube root 
centimeters, height, whatever 
to in order to guarantee that 
soup contains pi cubic centimeters 
soup 
so this turn 
whats best shape a soup 
so best case soup is to 
use a radius cube root 
you see that this graph 
here, im graphing surface area a 
given radius soup containing pi 
cubic centimeters soup 
you see that graph goes 
towards infinity here 
towards infinity there 
thats exactly situation 
radius is small big 
derivative is negative 
positive 
right 
functions decreasing 
increasing 
so this value really is a local minimum 
in fact, this is global minimum 
this function 
right 
thats this is best choice 
soup 
is this really a legitimate application 
calculus 
well, heres a task to think 
right 
go out, find soup cans check 

really building soup cans in 
order to minimize amount metal that 
takes to manufacture 
perhaps theres issues involved 
in manufacturing soup cans
