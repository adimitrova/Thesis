00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,324
[music] Here's kind of an old timey puzzle
about numbers.

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:07,797
Suppose you've got 2 numbers which add up
to 24.

3
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:12,707
You've got 2 numbers that sum to 24.
How large can their product be?

4
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:18,231
When you take those 2 numbers that add up
to 24, how big of a number can you get

5
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:24,233
when you multiply them together?
This is an optimization problem so let's

6
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:28,769
draw a picture.
Okay, maybe I can't draw a picture in this

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,759
problem but at least I can label things.
So, instead of just saying two numbers

8
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,889
that sum to 24, let's give them the name.
Two numbers, x and y, which sum to, to 24.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,174
And instead of just saying how large can
their product be, I can say, how large

10
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:50,901
can, you know, x times y be?
So, what's the goal?

11
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:57,243
Well, my goal here is really just to
maximize the product, so maximize x times

12
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,911
y.
And there's a constraint.

13
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:04,421
The constraint is that x and y have to add
up to 24.

14
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:08,856
So, I'll write that as x plus y equals 24.
Rats.

15
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:15,348
X,y isn't a function of a single variable.
I need to rewrite it so it's a function of

16
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:19,240
x alone.
Now, since x plus y is 24, I could rewrite

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,671
this as y equals 24 minus x.
And consequently, x times y, which is the

18
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:30,431
thing I'm trying to maximize, I could
write that as a function of a single

19
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:34,113
variable, x times, and instead of y 24
minus x.

20
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:37,381
So, this is the quantity now that I want
to maximize.

21
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,534
Now, I can apply Calculus.
Let's differentiate and then find the

22
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,036
critical points.
So, here's this function of a single

23
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:49,947
variable that I'm trying to maximize.
My function is x times 24 minus x, that

24
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:54,284
should be y or this is x times y, this
thing I'm trying to maximize.

25
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:57,021
But if I expand this out, I get 24x minus
x squared.

26
00:01:57,021 --> 00:02:01,394
Then, I can easily differentiate this.
The derivative of this function is, what's

27
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,142
the derivative of 24x?
It's 24.

28
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:06,072
What's the derivative minus x squared?
It's minus 2x.

29
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:11,017
I'm trying to find critical points, right?
Critical points are where the derivative

30
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:14,280
doesn't exist or where the derivative is
equal to 0.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,972
Now, this function's just a polynomial, so
it's differentiable everywhere.

32
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,516
So, I don't have to worry about the
functions derivative not existing

33
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,941
somewhere.
But I do have to find places where the

34
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:27,306
derivative is equal to zero.
So, when is this thing equal to zero?

35
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:31,171
Well, that's the same as asking, when 24
is 2x?

36
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:35,751
That's exactly when x is 12.
So, here is my critical point.

37
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:40,888
What sort of point is that?
Well, let's think about the s, i, g, n,

38
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:47,272
the sign of the first derivative.
The derivative is positive if x is less

39
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:52,701
than 12, and the derivative is negative if
x is bigger than 12.

40
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:57,225
What does that mean?
Well, that means the function is

41
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:03,439
increasing for x values less than 12.
And the function is decreasing for x

42
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,945
values bigger than 12.
So, the function goes up, gets to 12, and

43
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:14,009
starts going down.
What kind of point does that make 12?

44
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:19,555
Well, that must be a maximum.
So, I'll write f of 12 is my maximum

45
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:22,334
value.
So, what do we conclude?

46
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:27,727
So, here's our conclusion.
A 144 is the maximum product of two

47
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:32,752
numbers which sum to 24.
Did we really need the awesome power of

48
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,386
Calculus to solve this problem?
No.

49
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:39,366
For example, you could have used a
technique like this.

50
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:43,751
There's the so-called arithmetic geometric
mean inequality.

51
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:48,156
The AM-GM inequality.
And what it tells you is the following.

52
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:54,460
That for numbers a and b, the arithmetic
mean, just a fancy word for the average of

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,476
a and b, is bigger than or equal to the
geometric mean, which is the square root

54
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:05,933
of the product of a and b.
And this inequality becomes an equality,

55
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:11,937
if and only if a and b are the same.
Now, how can you use something like this?

56
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:15,467
Well, in our specific case, what do we
know?

57
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:21,647
I know that x plus y is equal to 24 and if
these two numbers add to 24, then their

58
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:25,044
average x plus y over 2 must be equal to
12.

59
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:31,122
But if this is their average by the AM-GM
inequality, this must be bigger than or

60
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:36,178
equal to the square root of x times y, the
geometric mean of x and y.

61
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:41,469
Now, how does this help us?
Well, what if I square both sides, right?

62
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:45,280
Then I know that 144 is bigger than or
equal to x times y.

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,236
And that's exactly what I'm trying to
figure out.

64
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:52,904
I'm trying to figure out how big can the
product of x and y be, if I know what the

65
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,732
sum is.
And what this is telling me, is that the

66
00:04:55,732 --> 00:05:00,294
product can be no bigger than 144, with
equality when x and y are both equal.

67
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:03,274
And that happens when they are both equal
to 12.

68
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:08,452
That you don't actually need Calculus to
solve many of the problems that are

69
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:13,892
assigned in Calculus courses, is perhaps
one of the best kept secrets of Calculus

70
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:17,361
instructors.
A result like this AM-GM inequality,

71
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:20,631
actually solves a ton of optimization
problems.

72
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:25,740
You often don't have to resort to taking
derivatives, if you can just apply a

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,116
result like this.
Calculus is a powerful tool but there are

74
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:40,955
other ways to attack these problems.
Don't be afraid to make use of other

75
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,147
methods.
