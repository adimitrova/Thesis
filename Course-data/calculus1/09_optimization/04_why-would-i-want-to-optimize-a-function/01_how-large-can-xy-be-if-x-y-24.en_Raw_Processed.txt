music heres kind an old timey puzzle 
numbers 
suppose youve got numbers add 
to 
youve got numbers that sum to 
large product 
you take numbers that add 
to , big a number you get 
you multiply together 
this is an optimization problem so lets 
draw a picture 
okay, maybe i cant draw a picture in this 
problem least i label things 
so, instead saying two numbers 
that sum to , lets give name 
two numbers, x y, sum to, to 
instead saying large 
product be, i say, large 
can, you know, x times y 
so, whats goal 
well, goal here is really to 
maximize product, so maximize x times 
y 
theres a constraint 
constraint is that x y to add 
to 
so, ill write that x plus y equals 
rats 
x,y isnt a function a single variable 
i need to rewrite so a function 
x alone 
now, since x plus y is , i could rewrite 
this y equals minus x 
consequently, x times y, is 
thing im trying to maximize, i could 
write that a function a single 
variable, x times, instead y 
minus x 
so, this is quantity that i want 
to maximize 
now, i apply calculus 
lets differentiate find 
critical points 
so, heres this function a single 
variable that im trying to maximize 
function is x times minus x, that 
y this is x times y, this 
thing im trying to maximize 
if i expand this out, i get x minus 
x squared 
then, i easily differentiate this 
derivative this function is, whats 
derivative x 

whats derivative minus x squared 
minus x 
im trying to find critical points, right 
critical points derivative 
doesnt exist derivative is 
equal to 
now, this functions a polynomial, so 
differentiable everywhere 
so, i dont to worry 
functions derivative existing 
somewhere 
i to find places 
derivative is equal to zero 
so, is this thing equal to zero 
well, thats asking, 
is x 
thats exactly x is 
so, here is critical point 
sort point is that 
well, lets think s, i, g, n, 
sign first derivative 
derivative is positive if x is less 
, derivative is negative if 
x is bigger 
that mean 
well, that means function is 
increasing x values less 
function is decreasing x 
values bigger 
so, function goes up, gets to , 
starts going 
kind point that make 
well, that must a maximum 
so, ill write f is maximum 
value 
so, we conclude 
so, heres conclusion 
a is maximum product two 
numbers sum to 
we really need awesome power 
calculus to solve this problem 

example, you could used a 
technique like this 
theres socalled arithmetic geometric 
mean inequality 
amgm inequality 
tells you is following 
that numbers a b, arithmetic 
mean, a fancy word average 
a b, is bigger equal to 
geometric mean, is square root 
product a b 
this inequality becomes an equality, 
if if a b 
now, you use something like this 
well, in specific case, we 
know 
i know that x plus y is equal to if 
two numbers add to , 
average x plus y must equal to 
if this is average amgm 
inequality, this must bigger 
equal to square root x times y, 
geometric mean x y 
now, this help us 
well, if i square sides, right 
i know that is bigger 
equal to x times y 
thats exactly im trying to 
figure 
im trying to figure big 
product x y be, if i know 
sum is 
this is telling me, is that 
product bigger , 
equality x y equal 
that happens equal 
to 
that you dont actually need calculus to 
solve many problems that 
assigned in calculus courses, is perhaps 
one best kept secrets calculus 
instructors 
a result like this amgm inequality, 
actually solves a ton optimization 
problems 
you often dont to resort to taking 
derivatives, if you apply a 
result like this 
calculus is a powerful tool there 
ways to attack problems 
dont afraid to make use 
methods
