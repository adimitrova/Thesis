1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,807
[music].
Let's suppose that you work for a soup

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:12,999
company, and they've given you a task, a
task to design a soup can that can hold

3
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:20,104
300 times pi cubic centimeters of soup.
This is really an optimization problem.

4
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:25,090
Your goal is to design a soup can using as
little metal as possible, which

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,972
nevertheless holds 300 pi cubic
centimeters of soup.

6
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:33,789
Okay, less dramatically, you're really
being asked to produce a cylinder with a

7
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,837
given volume.
I want the volume of the thing to be 300

8
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:41,138
pi cubic centimeters, and I want you to
minimize the surface area, right.

9
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:43,769
This thing's got a side and a top and a
bottom.

10
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:47,379
And I want you to minimize the surface
area for a given volume.

11
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,633
Probably helps to review a little bit of
the geometry that goes into this problem.

12
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:57,603
Here's a picture of a cylinder right, and
it's got some height that I'll be calling

13
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:01,814
h and a radius that I'll call r.
And the volume of this cylinder is pi r

14
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:04,836
squared h.
All right, pi r squared is the area, and

15
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:09,670
I'm multiplying by h to compute the volume
of this disk dragged through space.

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,936
What's the surface area of this cylinder?
Well 2 pi r squared counts the surface

17
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:22,209
area of the top disk and the bottom disk.
Each of those has pi r squared for their

18
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:25,873
area.
And the curved part of this cylinder has

19
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:28,782
area 2 pi r h.
Okay, let me draw a picture of my soup

20
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:31,038
can.
So, yeah, here's a little picture of our

21
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,935
soup can, and you see I've labeled the
relevant sizes.

22
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:37,932
The height of the can and the radius of
the can is what I'm trying to figure out.

23
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,072
Now what is it that I'm trying to
optimize?

24
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,241
So I'm trying to minimize the surface
area.

25
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,267
Here's that formula for the surface area
of this can, and I want that surface area

26
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,361
to be as small as possible.
Of course, if I wanted to make that

27
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:53,236
surface area as small as possible, I just
make a really tiny soup can, right?

28
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:57,484
But there's a constraint.
Well, the constraint is that soup can has

29
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:02,425
to hold 300 pi cubic centimeters of soup.
So I'm trying to make this quantity, the

30
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:07,235
surface area, as small as possible,
subject to the constraint that the volume

31
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:11,498
of the soup can is in fact 300 pi.
And I should also point out that the

32
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,826
radius and height had better be positive.
Otherwise, kind of nonsense.

33
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:19,546
This thing that I'm trying to optimize
really involves two variables.

34
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:23,571
It involves the height and also a radius.
Yeah this is some bad news, right?

35
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:27,991
The quantity that I'm trying to minimize
involves 2 variables, involves r and h.

36
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,617
And calculus, as we've been setting it up,
only works for understanding how a single

37
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:38,015
variable changing affects something else.
So I need to rewrite this function of two

38
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:41,126
variables as a function of a single
variable.

39
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:46,375
So, here we go, let's take this constraint
and let's solve for h, all right?

40
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,810
And if I start doing that, well, h is 300
pi over pi r squared and I can cancel

41
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,187
these, pis and I'm just left with h is 300
over r squared.

42
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:02,657
So, for a given radius, this is how tall I
need to make the soup can to guarantee

43
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:07,421
that the soup can holds 300 pi cubic
centimeters of soup.

44
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:14,294
Now, once I've got an equation for h in
terms of r, I can use this to rewrite the

45
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,365
thing I'm trying minimize just in terms of
r.

46
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:23,489
So, here we go.
The thing I'm trying to minimize now is 2

47
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:30,769
pi r squared plus 2 pi r times h, but h,
in order to satisfy the constraint, is 300

48
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,342
over r squared.
And now I can simplify this a little bit

49
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:39,247
further, right?
I've got an r and an r squared here.

50
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:43,066
So I can get rid of this square and get
rid of this r.

51
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:48,896
And then, the thing I'm trying to minimize
is 2 pi r squared plus 2 pi times 300,

52
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:54,140
which is 600 pi divided by r.
So this is the quantity that I'm trying to

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,937
minimize.
Now that I've got this thing written as a

54
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:03,674
function of a single variable, I'm really
tempted to do the fifth step here.

55
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:07,289
Apply calculus, right?
If I got a function of a single variable,

56
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,164
I could differentiate.
Find the critical points.

57
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,745
Figure out where the maxima and minima
occur.

58
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:17,307
But before we dive in to the calculus side
of this problem, let's just think about

59
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,091
some creative solutions to the soup can
issue.

60
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:24,610
For example, here's a little model of a
situation.

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,112
Here's the sun, here's Earth and here is
my new plan for soup cans, right?

62
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:35,223
Really big radius, really tiny height,
right?

63
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:41,895
Even if r is you know, 100 million miles,
that can make h small enough so that this

64
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:47,287
soup can contains exactly 300 pi cubic
centimeters of soup.

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,493
[laugh].
Well, what's the surface area in this

66
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:53,510
case?
Is this a really good choice for a soup

67
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,674
can, in, in terms of surface area?
No, right?

68
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:01,960
If I make r really big, admittedly, this
quantity, 600 pi over r, which is

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,491
measuring the curved area, that'll end up
being very small.

70
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:12,148
Right, but 2 pi r squared when r is really
big, this quantity, the amount of metal in

71
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:15,650
the top and the bottom of the can is
enormous right?

72
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,585
So this is not a great choice for soup
cans.

73
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:23,292
So having the soup can shaped like a giant
pancake is a terrible idea.

74
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:27,989
But what if I went the other way?
Here is a piece of wire, what if I made

75
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:31,990
the soup can really long and thin like
this piece of wire?

76
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,012
Well, here is that long, thin wire-shaped
soup can, right.

77
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:41,364
Even if I make the radius of my cylinder
very small, if I make it long enough, then

78
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:45,594
the soup can does hold 300 pi cubic
centimeters of soup, right?

79
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:50,550
And the question is, is this a really
smart choice to minimize surface area, and

80
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,251
no, it turns that if r is really small,
that's really not all that helpful.

81
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:58,991
Yeah, if r is really small, then 2 pi r
squared is really small.

82
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,828
I don't need very much metal on the top
and the bottom of the soup can.

83
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:07,175
But then 600 pi over r, which is how much
metal is in the curved part of the soup

84
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:09,578
can, this quantity is going to be
enormous.

85
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,234
So really, we see that these two things
are competing against each other.

86
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:17,209
A small value of r isn't really very
helpful, and a really big value of r isn't

87
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,272
very helpful.
So our creative solutions didn't quite pan

88
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,013
out.
Let's do some calculus now.

89
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:26,079
Okay, so I'm going to think of this
surface area as a function of a single

90
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,512
variable, r, right?
Here it is, f of r is 2 pi r squared plus

91
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:33,831
600 pi over r, and I'm going to
differentiate, and here's the derivative.

92
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:38,257
All right, I differentiate 2 pi r squared
to get 4 pi r, and I differentiate this

93
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:41,109
number divided by r.
Well, 1 over r is negative 1 over r

94
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,771
squared.
That's its derivative.

95
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,952
And the I multiply by 600 pi.
So this, is the derivative of this.

96
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:49,929
Now, I need to find the critical points.
Now, remember what critical points are,

97
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:52,322
right?
Critical points are where the derivative

98
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,145
vanishes, or where the derivative doesn't
exist, right?

99
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:58,896
The function's not differentible.
This function, that was differentible on

100
00:06:58,896 --> 00:06:59,969
its domain.
All right?

101
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,618
You might worry when r is equal to 0.
But that's not even in the domain of the

102
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:07,203
original function.
So I don't have to worry about that.

103
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:12,793
All right, now we've gotta figure out,
when is the derivative equal to zero, so

104
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:17,606
I'm trying to solve this.
I'll add 600 pi over r squared to both

105
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:21,424
sides.
So 4 pi r must be 600 pi over r squared in

106
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:26,680
that case.
I'll multiply both sides by r squared, and

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,740
I'll divide both sides by 4 pi.
And I'll get r cubed is 600 pi over 4 pi.

108
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,552
The pis cancel, and 600 over 4 is 150, so
r cubed must be 150.

109
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:44,648
In other words, r is the cube root of 150.
This is the only critical point.

110
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:48,549
Now that I found the critical points, what
about the end points?

111
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:52,760
Well, the end points actually aren't
really valid in this situation.

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,857
One of the end points might be when r is
equal to zero.

113
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,569
But in that case, the soup can has no
volume.

114
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,102
So I can't satisfy the constraint.
The same thing happens when h is equal to

115
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:05,989
zero.
In that case, the soup can, again, has no

116
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,836
volume.
So I can't satisfy the constraint.

117
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:13,444
So, I don't have to worry about the end
points, because they're not in the domain

118
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:17,137
that I'm considering.
But I do have to worry about the limiting

119
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:20,453
behavior when r is really big or when r is
really small.

120
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,905
So, we actually already handled the
limiting behavior.

121
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:26,638
Right?
We've already considered the situation

122
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:30,281
when r is really small.
That's the situation where the soup can's

123
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:33,791
like a long, thin wire.
And we checked, in that case the surface

124
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,218
area is enormous.
Right?

125
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:39,644
If r is small enough, the surface area can
be as large as you like, and still hold

126
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:44,296
300 pi cubic centimeters of soup.
We also consider the situation where r is

127
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:48,152
really large, right?
When r was really big ,we had this sort of

128
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,758
flat pancake shape for the soup can.
And in that case, we again saw that if r

129
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:57,346
is big enough, the surface area can be
made as large as you like, while still

130
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:01,371
having that soup can contain 300 pi cubic
centimeters of soup.

131
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,983
So, the only thing that really remains is
this critical point.

132
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:09,477
And if you plug this critical point into
the original function, you get this as the

133
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:13,833
resulting surface area, if you build your
soup can with a radius of cube root 150

134
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:18,321
centimeters, and your height, whatever it
has to be in order to guarantee that the

135
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:21,451
soup can contains 300 pi cubic centimeters
of soup.

136
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:25,608
So how does this turn out?
What's the best shape for a soup can?

137
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:30,427
So the best case for your soup can is to
use a radius of the cube root of 150.

138
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:35,340
And you can see that from this graph.
Here, I'm graphing the surface area for a

139
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,958
given radius of soup can containing 300 pi
cubic centimeters of soup.

140
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,701
And you can see that the graph goes up
towards infinity here.

141
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:48,119
And up towards infinity there.
And that's exactly the situation when the

142
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:52,258
radius is very small or very big.
The derivative is negative and then

143
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,387
positive.
Right?

144
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:56,242
The function's decreasing and then
increasing.

145
00:09:56,242 --> 00:10:01,724
So this value really is a local minimum.
And in fact, this is the global minimum of

146
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,444
this function.
Right?

147
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:07,633
And that's why this is the best choice for
your soup can.

148
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:11,638
Is this really a legitimate application of
calculus?

149
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,853
Well, here's a task to think about.
Right?

150
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:18,068
Go out, find some soup cans and check
them.
