2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,421
We're often trying to pick the best of
something.

3
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,410
We're trying to optimize our lives.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,890
Right?

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,510
We're given a bunch of choices, and we've
got to make the best choice.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,090
But how do we do this?

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,940
How do we do optimization?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,770
Well, if I've only got 17 choices, I can
just try all 17 choices.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,960
But what if the optimization problem is
more complicated.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,930
What if I've got infinitely many choices.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,300
What if I've got a function.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,180
It takes a real input, and produces some
real output.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,391
And I want to figure out which thing can I

14
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:42,170
plug into this function, to give me the
biggest possible output?

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,370
There's lots of problems in the real
world,

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,610
where this is basically the situation that
you're in.

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,026
You know?

18
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,808
You get to choose how many hours that you

19
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:53,190
work today, and that's really a, a real
number.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,440
Alright?

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,840
You can choose any number between zero and
24.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,780
And then you've got some sort of
happiness, right?

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,220
There's some sort of effect on your life
once you've made that choice.

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,740
And you're trying to figure out how many
hours should

25
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,660
you work today, to make yourself as happy
as possible, say.

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,760
And that's really this kind of problem.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,256
It's a problem where you've got a
function,

28
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,496
which takes a real input, produces a real

29
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:17,864
output, and you've got to figure out which

30
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:20,360
input, makes the output as big as
possible.

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,390
Well, unlike a situation where you've only
got

32
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,730
finitely many choices, you just try them
all.

33
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,010
When you've got infinitely many choices.

34
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,900
When your choice could be any real number
between 0 and 24, how can you choose?

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,280
You know?

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,370
You can't just try them all.

37
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,050
And it turns out that calculus comes into
play.

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,780
We can use calculus to solve these kinds
of optimization problems.

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:52,780
