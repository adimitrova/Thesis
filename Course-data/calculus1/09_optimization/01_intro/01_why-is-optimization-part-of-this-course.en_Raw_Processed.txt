often trying to pick best 
something 
trying to optimize lives 
right 
given a bunch choices, weve 
got to make best choice 
we this 
we optimization 
well, if ive got choices, i 
try choices 
if optimization problem is 
complicated 
if ive got infinitely many choices 
if ive got a function 
takes a real input, produces 
real output 
i want to figure thing i 
plug this function, to give 
biggest possible output 
theres lots problems in real 
world, 
this is basically situation that 
youre in 
you know 
you get to choose many hours that you 
work today, thats really a, a real 
number 
alright 
you choose number between zero 
youve got sort 
happiness, right 
theres sort effect life 
youve made that choice 
youre trying to figure many 
hours 
you work today, to make happy 
possible, say 
thats really this kind problem 
a problem youve got a 
function, 
takes a real input, produces a real 
output, youve got to figure 
input, makes output big 
possible 
well, unlike a situation youve 
got 
finitely many choices, you try 

youve got infinitely many choices 
choice could real number 
between , you choose 
you know 
you cant try 
turns that calculus comes 
play 
we use calculus to solve kinds 
optimization problems
