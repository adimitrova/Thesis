1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:12,711
[MUSIC] There are subtleties even to 
things that appear as simple as addition. 

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:18,469
Here, I've got some addition problems. 
4279 + 1202, 

3
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:18,801
4279 + 1190, 
4269 + 1207, 

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:18,801
42731202. 
+ 1191, 

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:30,720
and 4270 + 1100 You'll notice that 
they're all close to this problem. 

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,471
The numbers that I've been listing off 
are all hovering around this problem. 

7
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:37,927
Anyway, I'm going to give out these 
problems to some people and have them try 

8
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:47,015
to do them. 
[MUSIC] Hi, I'm [UNKNOWN] and I'm Math 

9
00:00:47,015 --> 00:01:00,651
junior undergraduate at Ohio State. 
[MUSIC] Yeah. My name is Jacob Turner. 

10
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:07,015
I'm a graduate TA here at OSU. 
[MUSIC] Alright. 

11
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,348
People are finished doing the arithmetic 
problems. 

12
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,760
Let's record the answers. 
So 

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:33,400
here, 4270 + 1200 was 5470. 
4279 + 1202 was 5481. 

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:51,540
The next one is 5476, I've got 5467, 
and the last one was 5464. 

15
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,541
what do all these numbers have in common? 
They're all really close together. 

16
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:02,055
Is that just an accident? 
Of course, it's not an accident, right? 

17
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,250
Here's the fact. 
Near the sum of two numbers is the sum of 

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,444
two nearby numbers. 
These arithmetic problems are not just 

19
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:15,217
random arithmetic problems. 
Look at the numbers I'm asking them to 

20
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,157
add. 
4277 and 1190, 

21
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:19,990
those Those numbers are really close to 
4273 and 1191. 

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,341
Which is really close to 4270 and 1200. 
Which is really close to 4269 and 1207, 

23
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:29,101
alright? 
Near the sum of two numbers is the sum of 

24
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:33,840
two nearby numbers, 
all of the answers are nearby as well. 

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,040
How does this relate to limits? 
Let's take a look. 

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,721
Here's how it relates to limits. 
The limit of f of x plus g of x as x 

27
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:50,285
approaches a, is the limit of f of x as x 
approaches a plus the limit of g of x, as 

28
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:54,017
x approaches a. 
How is this related to those arithmetic 

29
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:57,342
problems? 
Well, remember what this limit is saying. 

30
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:02,566
This is saying, what can I make f of x 
plus g of x close to, if I'm willing to 

31
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:07,318
make x sufficiently close to a. 
Well, it's going to be close to whatever 

32
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,086
I can make f of x close to added to 
whatever I can make g of x close to, 

33
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,734
right? 
It's the same kind of setup, right? 

34
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:18,641
Near the sum of two values is the sum of 
the nearby values. 

35
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,820
For the limit of a sum is the sum of the 
limits. 

36
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,221
We can use this fact to do some 
calculations. 

37
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:30,256
Let's see how. 
So, here's a limit problem. 

38
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:33,633
The limit of x squared plus x as x 
approaches two. 

39
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:37,889
I really want you to resist the 
temptation to just plug in two. 

40
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,550
We're going to be using our limit laws to 
try to evaluate this limit. 

41
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:49,658
Now, this is the limit of a sum, and the 
limit of the sum is the sum of the limits 

42
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:55,186
provided the limits exist. 
So, this limit of x squared plus x is 

43
00:03:55,186 --> 00:04:01,943
equal to the limit of x squared as x 
approaches 2 plus the limit of x as x 

44
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:05,870
approaches 2. 
Now, what's the limit of x squared? 

45
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,089
Because the limit of the products is also 
the product of the limits provided the 

46
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:15,467
limits exist, this is the limit of a 
product. 

47
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:20,996
This is the limit of x times x. 
That's what x squared means, it's x times 

48
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:24,220
x. 
So, I could rewrite this as the limit of 

49
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,132
x times x, as x approaches 2+. 
Now what's the limit of x as x approaches 

50
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:33,291
2? 
This is asking, what does x get close to 

51
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,112
when x gets close to 2? 
Or, some more precisely, what can I 

52
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:42,036
guarantee that x is close to if I'm 
willing to make x sufficiently close to 

53
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,756
2? 
The limit of x as x approaches 2 is 2, 

54
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,700
alright? 
So, this limit is just two. 

55
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,374
Now, this a limit of a product, and the 
limit of a product is the product of the 

56
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:59,288
limits provided the limits exist. 
So, this limit is the limit of x as x 

57
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:05,260
approaches 2 times the limit of x as x 
approaches to +2. 

58
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,908
Now again, the limit of x as x approaches 
two, right? 

59
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,273
What can I guarantee that x is close to 
if x is close to 2? 

60
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,347
Well, two. 
So, this is just 2. 

61
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:18,853
This limit is the same thing, it's again 
just 2. 

62
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:24,648
And here, I have +2. 
2 * 2 + 2 is 6, which is the value of the 

63
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:27,940
limit of x squared plus x as x approaches 
2. 

64
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,912
The takeaway message here is ask not what 
your country can do for you but what you 

65
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:39,522
can do for your country. 
Or in other words, that the limit of a 

66
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:42,726
sum is the sum of the limits provided the 
limits exist. 

67
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:45,405
It's the same rhetorical device right, 
x-y, y-x. 

68
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:50,297
Alright, the limit of a sum is the sum of 
the limits provided the limits exist. 

69
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:54,839
I hope this is very memorable because 
these kinds of chiastic rules are going 

70
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,800
to be used throughout our time together 
in order to evaluate limits. 

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,801
Soon, we're going to see that the same 
sort of pattern holds not just for sums, 

72
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:12,988
but for differences, for products and 
almost for quotients. 

73
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,909
Good luck.
