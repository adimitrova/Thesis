music limits probably 
important concept in this course 
so we really a definition 
we mean limit 
here is we mean limits 
to say that limit f x x 
approaches a is equal to l means that f 
x close to l desired 
making x close enough to a 
there is a tons subtlety to this 
definition so worth to look an 
example 
so lets take a look this function 
this is function that takes an input 
x spits xsecond minus one 
divided x minus one 
so lets try plugging in number three 
this function 
so i plug in number three this 
function i to compute, 
right 
three squared minus one three minus 
one well, thats three squared is nine 
minus one is eight three minus one is two 
nine divided two is four sure 
enough, this function comes 
number four lets look that example 
a little bit detail 
this is actually a pretty complicated 
function 
alright 
i open function 
alright 
take a look functions 
actually calculations 
you think this function 
three different steps 
alright 
one steps squares input 
subtracts one, so i calculate 
numerator 
another step subtracts one 
input 
outputs two steps get 
plugged division 
thats i get output this 
big complicated function 
now, something like xtwo one, 
you could also think that 
some, you know separate steps well 
this is good right 
okay 
lets see happens 
i take number three i plug 
function 
alright 
im going to calculating 
numerator denominator separately, 
so ill take s, here, ill 
look threetwo one ill get 
eight 
here, three one became two 
eight two get plugged 
division, eight divided two is 
four that becomes output 
function, 
right 
inputs three, output is four i 
look this way, i see 
steps are, playing 
okay 
i evaluate function three, 
cares 
well, lets try to evaluate function 
one instead three 
so happens we plug in 
number one this function 
i got number one here 
im going to look inside 
im going to open this function 
imagine ive got this number one 
im going to plug function 
right 
im going to evaluating 
numerator denominator separately, so 
im going to take this one split 
up, plug numerator 
denominator 
numerator sends input to 
input squared minus one 
so onetwo minus one is zero 
thing here, one one is zero 
ive got im going to 
plugging in to 
okay, bad 
right 
im dividing zero i 
proceed, so this function is defined 
one 
so i cant plug one function 
if i wanted to figure 
functions value that inputs near 
one, i could that 
so lets try to plug in one point one 
instead so lets plug one point one 
this function 
i cant plug in one i need to 
divide zero, lets try 
plugging in one point one im going to 
open function take one 
point one plug function 
one point one is going to to 
evaluated in numerator 
denominator 
one point onesecond minus one is 
twentyone 
one point one minus one became one 
twentyone one going 
division 
twentyone divided one is two point 
one so i evaluate function 
one pint one i get two point one 
instead plugging in one value, 
lets plug in a whole bunch values 
well make a table 
so use that function 
f x is xsecond minus one divided x 
minus one now, i cant plug 
function, if i plug in one, id 
dividing zero, i cant divide 
zero 
one isnt in domain this function 
i plug in numbers near one, 
right 
we saw that one point one if i plug 
in that, i get two point one 
right 
if i plug in one point zero one i get 
two point zero one if i plug in point 
zero zero one i get two point zero zero 
one 
right 
so 
if i plug in i get 
right 
well, whats going here 
i could summarize this situation 
saying following 
limit x squared minus one x 
minus one x approaches one is equal to 
two 
is that 
well, this is 
i make x x minus one 
close to two i want 
if 
i make x 
close enough 
to one 
lets see 
heres table alright if you want 
output this function to within a 
billionth two you need to is to 
make sure that input is within a 
trillionth one alright 
long input is close enough to 
one you guarantee that output is 
close to two you like 
this is looking a table 
values 
you know, maybe a dozen values seeing 
theyre getting close to 
would a lot better if there a 
convincing argument 
so lets go back to definition 
limit 
to say limit f x equals l means 
that f x made close to l 
you desire making x close enough to a 
let emphasize something 
close enough 
equal 
to a 
something like this matter 
well, lets go back to example 
in example function wasnt 
defined one 
limit doesnt depend upon 
functions value one 
depends functions value 
near one 
so x squared minus one x minus one 
is equal to x plus one long x isnt 
equal to one right 
long x isnt one this is a true 
statement 
so whats limit x goes to one 
x squared minus one x one 
well, this is limit x approaches 
one x 
one one 
limit doesnt depend upon 
value function one 
depends upon values 
function near one 
a result, two things 
limit 
even better limit x plus one, x 
approaches one, well thats limit 
a sum 
limit a sum is sum 
limits 
so i rewrite this limit limit 
x goes to one x plus limit x 
goes to one one 
limit x x goes to one 
well thats asking i make x 
close to if i make x close enough to one 
well thats one 
limit one x goes to one is 
asking whats one close to x is 
close to well theres even an x in 
this right wiggling x doesnt affect this 
so that limits also one 
one plus one is two so indeed 
limit 
xtwenty two minus one divided x one 
x approaches one is two 
limits provide information a 
functions values approaching, 
alright 
a way accessing otherwise 
forbidden information 
i might able to plug in value 
one, that would entailed 
dividing zero 
yet i know, that functions output 
is close to two i like 
long input is close to 
equal to one
