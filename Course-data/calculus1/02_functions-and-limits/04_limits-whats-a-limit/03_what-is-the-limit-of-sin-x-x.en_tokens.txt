so
here
's
a
great
function
to
look
at
.
the
function
is
going
to
be
defined
by
f
(
x
)
=
sine
x
/
x.
my
question
is
what
's
the
limit
of
this
function
,
as
x
approaches
zero
.
let
's
try
to
guess
the
limit
by
looking
at
a
table
of
function
values
.
so
here
's
a
bunch
of
input
values
that
are
getting
closer
and
closer
to
zero
,
right.1
,
.01
,
.001.
it
's
getting
closer
and
closer
to
zero
.
then
looking
at
my
output
values
from
my
function
,
right
?
so
f
(
1
)
is
sine
of
1
/
1.
it
's
the
sine
of
1.
f
(
.1
)
,
that
's
sign
of
1.
over
1
,
.
it
's
a
little
bit
more
.
f
(
.01
)
is
9999.
a
little
bit
more
.
and
you
keep
looking
down
here
and
these
numbers
seem
to
be
getting
close
to
something
,
alright
.
999999.
this
is
really
,
really
close
to
one
.
so
based
on
this
table
of
values
your
tempted
to
guess
that
the
limit
of
f
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
0
is
1.
another
way
to
gain
some
insight
about
this
limit
will
be
to
look
at
the
graph
.
here
's
the
graph
.
this
is
the
graph
of
sign
x
over
x.
and
you
can
see
that
when
x
equals
zero
,
functions
not
defined
there
because
i
ca
n't
divide
by
zero
,
so
i
got
this
little
hole
in
the
graph
.
nevertheless
,
i
'm
claiming
that
the
limit
as
x
approaches
0
is
equal
to
1
which
actually
means
that
i
can
make
the
output
as
close
to
1
as
you
like
,
if
you
're
willing
to
have
the
input
be
close
enough
to
0.
instead
of
talking
about
closeness
,
push
this
red
button
and
turn
on
this
red
interval
.
so
when
i
say
close
to
one
,
what
i
really
mean
is
the
output
is
inside
this
,
this
red
interval
.
and
that
red
interval
might
be
really
big
or
it
might
be
really
small
.
but
to
be
close
to
one
is
going
to
mean
inside
the
red
interval
.
the
point
is
that
,
can
turn
on
this
blue
interval
.
and
as
close
as
you
want
the
output
to
be
the
one
,
i
can
promise
you
that
the
output
is
within
the
red
interval
if
the
input
is
within
this
blue
interval
.
when
the
red
interval
is
really
big
,
well
that
's
not
much
of
a
challenge
.
i
can
have
a
really
wide
blue
interval
and
anything
inside
the
blue
interval
has
output
landing
inside
the
red
interval
.
but
even
when
the
red
interval
is
very
,
very
small
there
's
still
some
tiny
blue
interval
so
that
whenever
x
is
within
the
blue
interval
,
the
output
is
within
the
tiny
red
interval
.
in
other
words
,
even
if
you
want
the
output
to
be
really
close
to
one
.
i
can
promise
you
that
the
output
is
that
close
to
one
,
if
you
're
willing
to
have
the
input
be
close
enough
to
zero
.
so
,
we
've
looked
at
the
function
values
,
we
've
looked
at
the
graph
.
we
've
got
this
idea
that
the
limit
of
sine
x
over
x
as
x
approaches
zero
is
equal
to
one
.
but
it
's
just
that
,
it
's
just
an
idea
.
we
do
n't
yet
have
a
rigorous
argument
that
this
limit
is
equal
to
one
.
here
's
a
sketch
of
a
more
rigorous
argument
that
the
limit
of
sine
x
/
x
,
as
x
approaches
0
is
equal
to
one
.
it
turns
out
that
for
values
of
x
which
are
close
to
but
not
equal
to
zero
,
this
is
true
.
cosine
of
x
is
less
than
sine
x
over
x
,
and
sine
x
over
x
is
less
than
one
.
now
why
would
you
care
about
this
?
note
,
the
limit
of
cosine
x
as
x
approaches
zero
is
one
and
the
limit
of
1
is
1
because
the
limit
of
a
constant
function
is
just
that
constant
.
so
i
know
that
the
limit
of
this
side
is
one
and
the
limit
of
this
side
is
one
and
what
i
'm
trying
to
conclude
is
that
the
limit
of
the
thing
in
between
is
also
one
.
and
it
turns
out
there
's
a
way
to
do
this
.
let
's
take
a
look
.
here
's
what
we
're
going
to
use
,
the
squeeze
theorum
.
suppose
you
've
got
three
functions
,
i
'm
calling
them
gf
and
h.
g
(
x
)
is
less
than
equal
to
f
(
x
)
and
f
(
x
)
is
less
than
equal
to
h
(
x
)
.
for
values
of
x
that
are
near
a
,
but
maybe
these
inner
qualities
do
n't
hold
at
the
point
a.
also
,
suppose
that
the
limit
of
g
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
,
is
equal
to
the
limit
of
h
(
x
)
as
x
approach
a
,
is
equal
to
sum
l.
so
the
limit
of
g
(
x
)
,
the
limit
of
h
of
x
are
the
same
value
,
l.
the
,
you
get
to
conclude
the
limit
of
f
as
x
approaches
a
exists
and
it
equals
l.
why
is
this
thing
called
the
squeeze
theorem
or
some
people
call
it
the
sandwich
theorem
or
the
pinching
theorem
?
let
's
take
a
look
.
just
pictorially
,
why
is
this
called
the
squeeze
theorem
?
i
've
got
an
example
here
.
three
functions
.
g
,
f
,
and
h.
and
again
,
g
(
x
)
is
less
than
f
(
x
)
,
f
(
x
)
less
than
h
(
x
)
.
now
,
note
,
the
limit
of
g
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
is
l.
and
the
limit
of
h
(
x
)
as
x
approaches
a
is
l.
f
is
squeezed
,
or
sandwiched
,
between
h
and
g.
and
consequently
,
the
limit
of
f
as
x
approaches
a
is
also
equal
to
l.
now
,
we
're
going
to
use
the
squeeze
theorem
to
try
to
understand
the
limit
of
sin
x
over
x.
so
we
've
got
the
squeeze
theorem
.
and
what
do
i
know
?
i
know
that
cosine
x
is
less
than
sine
x
/
x
is
less
than
1
for
values
of
x
that
are
close
to
but
not
equal
to
0.
and
the
limit
of
cosine
x
as
x
approaches
0
is
equal
to
1.
if
you
like
,
because
cosines
continuous
and
cosine
of
0
is
1.
also
the
limit
of
1
as
x
approaches
0
is
equal
to
1
because
the
limit
of
a
constant
function
is
that
constant
.
so
the
limit
of
this
function
is
one
,
the
limit
of
this
function
is
one
as
x
approaches
zero
.
and
that
means
by
the
squeeze
theorem
,
the
limit
of
sine
x
/
x
is
also
equal
to
1
