music so heres a great function to 
look 
function is going to defined 
fx sine x x 
question is whats limit this 
function, x approaches zero 
lets try to guess limit looking 
a table function values 
so heres a bunch input values that 
getting closer closer to zero, 
right, , 
getting closer closer to zero 
looking output values 
function, 
right 
so f is sine 
sine 
f, thats sign , 
a little bit 
f is a little bit 
you keep looking here 
numbers seem to getting close to 
something, alright this is 
really, really close to one 
so based this table values 
tempted to guess that limit fx 
x approaches is 
another way to gain insight 
this limit will to look graph 
heres graph 
this is graph sign x x 
you see that x equals zero, 
functions defined there i 
cant divide zero, so i got this 
little hole in graph 
nevertheless, im claiming that limit 
x approaches is equal to 
actually means that i make output 
close to you like, if youre 
willing to input close enough 
to 
instead talking closeness, push 
this red button turn this red 
interval 
so i say close to one, i really 
mean is output is inside this, this 
red interval 
that red interval might really big 
might really small 
to close to one is going to mean 
inside red interval 
point is that, turn this blue 
interval 
close you want output to 
one, i promise you that 
output is within red interval if 
input is within this blue interval 
red interval is really big, well 
thats much a challenge 
i a really wide blue interval 
anything inside blue interval 
output landing inside red interval 
even red interval is very, 
small theres still tiny blue 
interval so that whenever x is within 
blue interval, output is within 
tiny red interval 
in words, even if you want 
output to really close to one 
i promise you that output is that 
close to one, if youre willing to 
input close enough to zero 
so, weve looked function values, 
weve looked graph 
weve got this idea that limit 
sine x x x approaches zero is 
equal to one 
that, an idea 
we dont yet a rigorous argument 
that this limit is equal to one 
heres a sketch a rigorous 
argument that limit sine x x, 
x approaches is equal to one 
turns that values x 
close to equal to zero, this 
is true 
cosine x is less sine x x, 
sine x x is less one 
would you care this 
note, limit cosine x x 
approaches zero is one limit 
is limit a constant 
function is that constant 
so i know that limit this side is 
one limit this side is one 
im trying to conclude is that 
limit thing in between is also 
one 
turns theres a way to 
this 
lets take a look 
heres going to use, 
squeeze theorum 
suppose youve got three functions, im 
calling gf h 
gx is less equal to fx fx 
is less equal to hx 
values x that near a, 
maybe inner qualities dont hold 
point a 
also, suppose that limit gx x 
approaches a, is equal to limit 
hx x approach a, is equal to sum l 
so limit gx, limit h x 
value, l 
the, you get to conclude limit f 
x approaches a exists equals l 
is this thing called squeeze 
theorem people call 
sandwich theorem pinching theorem 
lets take a look 
pictorially, is this called 
squeeze theorem 
ive got an example here 
three functions 
g, f, h 
again, gx is less fx, fx 
less hx 
now, note, limit gx x 
approaches a is l 
limit hx x approaches a 
is l 
f is squeezed, sandwiched, between h 
g 
consequently, limit f x 
approaches a is also equal to l 
now, going to use squeeze 
theorem to try to understand limit 
sin x x 
so weve got squeeze theorem 
i know 
i know that cosine x is less sine x 
x is less values x that 
close to equal to 
limit cosine x x approaches 
is equal to 
if you like, cosines continuous 
cosine is 
also limit x approaches is 
equal to limit a 
constant function is that constant 
so limit this function is one, 
limit this function is one x 
approaches zero 
that means squeeze theorem, 
limit sine x x is also equal to
