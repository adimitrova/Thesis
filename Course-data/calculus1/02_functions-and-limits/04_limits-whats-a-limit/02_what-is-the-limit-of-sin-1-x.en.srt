1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,285
[SOUND] So here's a table of values of 
the function F of X equals sin 1 / X. 

2
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:14,100
F of one is really sin of one, it's like 
8.. 

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:21,322
F of 1. which is really sin of one over 
1. sin of 10 -.5. 

4
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:25,030
F of 01.. 
This will be sine of 100, it's also about 

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,889
-0.5. 
F of 0.001, which is like sine of 1000, 

6
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:33,062
well that's 0.8 and some more, right? 
So the question is these numbers aren't 

7
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:36,261
really getting close to anything in 
particular. 

8
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:41,639
Can you really say that if you evaluate f 
at values which are close to but not 

9
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:46,608
equal to zero, that the outputs are 
actually getting close to anything in 

10
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:49,603
particular. 
I mean this is positive, negative, 

11
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:54,300
negative, positive, negative, positive, 
negative, it's looking pretty bad. 

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,227
Instead of a table, let's look at a 
graph. 

13
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:02,391
Here, I've got a graph of the funtcion f 
(x) = sin 1 / x. 

14
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,741
And you see the middle of this graph is 
just that horrible green blob. 

15
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,860
Right? 
It's really hard to make out any detail. 

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,701
You might think that's just a consequence 
of the fact that I'm drawing this graph 

17
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:18,703
with such thick lines. 
You know, and if I used thinner lines to 

18
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:24,180
draw my graph, maybe I could, you know 
get rid of this green blob and really see 

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,924
some detail. 
Even if I dial down the size of the lines 

20
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:32,984
that I'm using to draw this graph, the 
blob thing is still there, you know. 

21
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:36,520
And it's really there in the graph of the 
function. 

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,205
Even if these lines were true lines, zero 
thickness, it wouldn't be possible to fit 

23
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:47,266
even a single atom next to the Y axis 
without touching the graph of this 

24
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:50,649
function. 
The graph is oscillating wildly near 

25
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,080
zero. 
Even if your input is very close to zero 

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,810
your output could be anything between -1 
and 1. 

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:08,762
So in light of this evidence, the limit 
of sine 1 / x as x approaches 0 does not. 

28
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:14,643
[SOUND] exist. 
Which sometimes I'll abbreviate DNE, for 

29
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:18,676
does not exist. 
what does it even mean to say it doesn't 

30
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,970
exist? 
What do we mean by the definition of 

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,814
limit? 
To say the limit equals something means 

32
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:28,484
that I can make the output as close as I 
want to l by making x close to a. 

33
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:33,722
So when I say this limit doesn't exist, I 
mean it's not the case that this limit is 

34
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:37,319
equal to anything, okay? 
If you tell me this limit is some 

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,089
positive number, well look. 
When I evaluate the function at a number 

36
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:45,037
very close to 0, the output is negative. 
So the limit is probably not some 

37
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:49,089
positive number but there's also inputs 
very close to zero that give positive 

38
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,517
outputs so that the limit is pulling out 
a negative number either. 

39
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:56,621
Limit is pulling out zero either cause 
none of these numbers are getting close 

40
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:57,920
to zero. 
So in this sense. 

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,049
This limit just doesn't exist because 
it's not the case that this limit is 

42
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,013
equal to anything in particular. 
If you tell me this limit is equal to l, 

43
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,592
I'm going to show you numbers close to 
zero which aren't close to l. 

44
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,180
Let's see another example along the same 
lines. 

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,713
This is a particularly confusing example 
because in the function f(x)x) = sine pi 

46
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:22,582
/ x. 
The function evaluated at 1 is 0. 

47
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:28,600
That's pretty clear because that is sine 
of pi and sine of pi is zero. 

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,053
About the function at 0.1, I'm counting 
that's also equal to zero. 

49
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:37,781
The function at 0.01, that is also zero. 
This can be kind of confusing. 

50
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:43,262
When you take a look here, I typed in sin 
pi divided by 0.01 on to my calculator. 

51
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:46,620
This is calculating the function's value 
at 01.. 

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,944
If I ask my calculator to do this, it is 
not telling me the answer zero, right? 

53
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:56,853
The calculator's giving me this, 
admittedly, a very small number, right, E 

54
00:03:56,853 --> 00:04:00,587
-11 here. 
But it's still not actually zero. 

55
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:03,698
So, can I convince you that this is even 
true? 

56
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:07,640
That the functions value at 01. actually 
is equal to zero. 

57
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:23,040
What is f (0.01)? 
Well it's the same as sine, of pi / 0.01. 

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,080
Now here I'm taking pi and I'm dividing 
it by 0.01. 

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,387
That's the same thing as what? 
That's the same thing as multiplying a 

60
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,619
100. 
I'm dividing by a hundredth, that's the 

61
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:41,881
same as multiplying by a 100. 
So this function at.01 is sine of 100 pi. 

62
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,317
What's sine of 100 pi? 
Well, think back to what the graph of 

63
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:52,732
sine looks like. 
Here's a graph of sine, zero to two pi. 

64
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:58,452
If I do it again. 
Here it is at four pi, and I drew it 

65
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:02,202
again. 
Here it is at six pi, and I'm going to 

66
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:07,050
keep on going. 
And eventually, I'm going to get to 100 

67
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,891
pi. 
And at that point, sign really is going 

68
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:15,921
to be equal to zero. 
Calculators are great, they're also 

69
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:20,312
terrible. 
This calculator can't really calculate 

70
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:26,257
with pi, all it can do is calculate with 
some approximation to pi. 

71
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:26,440
We can use our human mind to evaluate 
this function exactly. 

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,356
In light of this evidence, you might be 
tricked into believing that the limit of 

73
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:40,619
f(x) as x approaches 0 is equal to 0. 
After all these points are approaching 

74
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:45,634
zero, and function evaluating each of 
these points is zero. 

75
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:52,028
So maybe that means that this is true. 
So it looks like the limit is equal to 

76
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,058
zero. 
But, what happens if I look at some other 

77
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:58,107
points? 
We'll take a look at this example. 

78
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,446
Here's the same function, f of x equals 
sign of pi over x. 

79
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:08,154
This function, if I evaluate it at 75. is 
this, maybe a little bit mysterious 

80
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:13,634
number, negative 866. and so forth. 
If I evaluate this function at 075. you 

81
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:17,896
get the same thing. 
If I evaluate the function at 0075,. I 

82
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:22,235
get the same thing. 
At 00075. I get the same thing, .000075, 

83
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:25,660
I get the same thing. 
So, what's going on here. 

84
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,584
Well what is this number? 
I mean 0.8666. 

85
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,720
This isn't just some sort of random 
number. 

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,367
Right? 
This is in fact negative the square root 

87
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:41,805
of three over two. 
And it looks like this function at all of 

88
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:47,529
these points has the same value, negative 
the square root of three over two. 

89
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:53,253
So does that mean that the limit as X 
approaches zero of F of X, [SOUND] is 

90
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:57,222
equal to negative the square root of 
three over two? 

91
00:06:57,222 --> 00:07:03,099
[SOUND] I mean again all of these values, 
.75.075.0075, these input values are 

92
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:09,320
approaching zero, and the functions value 
at all of those inputs is the same. 

93
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,754
So, what gives, is the limit zero, is a 
negative point A, which is it?. 

94
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:18,390
Okay, okay, I've been little bit too 
tricky in picking my input points. 

95
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,564
Since the same function, F of X equals 
Sin pie over X, and here, I am picking a 

96
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:27,729
collection of points, again approaching 
zero, .7, .07, .007, .0007. 

97
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,769
Its getting closer and closer to zero. 
But now, my output values are looking 

98
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:36,263
pretty random. 
I mean, they are not over the same, for 

99
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:39,488
instance. 
So this is, maybe some evidence, that, 

100
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:46,440
the limit. 
Of sine pi over x as x approaches zero. 

101
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,982
Doesn't exist. 
Here I've got a bunch of input points 

102
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:57,883
that are getting closer and closer to 
zero but my output values at least don't 

103
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:02,600
appear to be getting close to. 
We're not just learning. 

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,404
We're exploring. 
[SOUND] I encourage you to cook up you 

105
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:12,208
own examples. 
We've seen a couple examples now of where 

106
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,489
limits don't exist but can you come up 
with more? 

107
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:17,188
[SOUND]
