1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,977
[MUSIC] So here's a great function to 
look at. 

2
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:12,227
The function is going to be defined by 
f(x) = sine x / x. 

3
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:18,382
My question is what's the limit of this 
function, as x approaches zero. 

4
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:23,341
Let's try to guess the limit by looking 
at a table of function values. 

5
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,796
So here's a bunch of input values that 
are getting closer and closer to zero, 

6
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,622
right.1, .01, .001. 
It's getting closer and closer to zero. 

7
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:36,164
Then looking at my output values from my 
function, 

8
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:39,425
right? 
So f(1) is sine of 1 / 1. 

9
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:43,869
It's the sine of 1. 
f(.1), that's sign of 1. over 1,. it's 

10
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,208
99.. 
A little bit more. 

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:52,956
f(.01) is 9999. a little bit more. 
And you keep looking down here and these 

12
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:59,254
numbers seem to be getting close to 
something, alright. 999999. this is 

13
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:05,102
really, really close to one. 
So based on this table of values your 

14
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:11,740
tempted to guess that the limit of f(x) 
as x approaches 0 is 1. 

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,520
Another way to gain some insight about 
this limit will be to look at the graph. 

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,080
Here's the graph. 
This is the graph of sign x over x. 

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,147
And you can see that when x equals zero, 
functions not defined there because I 

18
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:29,256
can't divide by zero, so I got this 
little hole in the graph. 

19
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:35,008
Nevertheless, I'm claiming that the limit 
as x approaches 0 is equal to 1 which 

20
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:40,486
actually means that I can make the output 
as close to 1 as you like, if you're 

21
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,910
willing to have the input be close enough 
to 0. 

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,616
Instead of talking about closeness, push 
this red button and turn on this red 

23
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:51,673
interval. 
So when I say close to one, what I really 

24
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:54,852
mean is the output is inside this, this 
red interval. 

25
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:59,131
And that red interval might be really big 
or it might be really small. 

26
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,860
But to be close to one is going to mean 
inside the red interval. 

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,820
The point is that, can turn on this blue 
interval. 

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,651
And as close as you want the output to be 
the one, I can promise you that the 

29
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:17,420
output is within the red interval if the 
input is within this blue interval. 

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,575
When the red interval is really big, well 
that's not much of a challenge. 

31
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:26,249
I can have a really wide blue interval 
and anything inside the blue interval has 

32
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:31,116
output landing inside the red interval. 
But even when the red interval is very, 

33
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:36,617
very small there's still some tiny blue 
interval so that whenever x is within the 

34
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:40,441
blue interval, the output is within the 
tiny red interval. 

35
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,070
In other words, even if you want the 
output to be really close to one. 

36
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,070
I can promise you that the output is that 
close to one, if you're willing to have 

37
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,577
the input be close enough to zero. 
So, we've looked at the function values, 

38
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:58,528
we've looked at the graph. 
We've got this idea that the limit of 

39
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,677
sine x over x as x approaches zero is 
equal to one. 

40
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:06,307
But it's just that, it's just an idea. 
We don't yet have a rigorous argument 

41
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:10,444
that this limit is equal to one. 
Here's a sketch of a more rigorous 

42
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:15,260
argument that the limit of sine x / x, as 
x approaches 0 is equal to one. 

43
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,077
It turns out that for values of x which 
are close to but not equal to zero, this 

44
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:24,494
is true. 
Cosine of x is less than sine x over x, 

45
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:29,338
and sine x over x is less than one. 
Now why would you care about this? 

46
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:34,475
Note, the limit of cosine x as x 
approaches zero is one and the limit of 1 

47
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:39,071
is 1 because the limit of a constant 
function is just that constant. 

48
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:44,681
So I know that the limit of this side is 
one and the limit of this side is one and 

49
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:49,954
what I'm trying to conclude is that the 
limit of the thing in between is also 

50
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,725
one. 
And it turns out there's a way to do 

51
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,280
this. 
Let's take a look. 

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,395
Here's what we're going to use, the 
squeeze theorum. 

53
00:03:57,395 --> 00:04:01,355
Suppose you've got three functions, I'm 
calling them GF and H. 

54
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:06,094
G(x) is less than equal to f(x) and f(x) 
is less than equal to H(x). 

55
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:11,157
For values of x that are near A, but 
maybe these inner qualities don't hold at 

56
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:14,727
the point A. 
Also, suppose that the limit of G(x) as x 

57
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:19,855
approaches A, is equal to the limit of 
H(x) as x approach A, is equal to sum L. 

58
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:24,010
So the limit of G(x), the limit of H of X 
are the same value, L. 

59
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:31,560
The, you get to conclude the limit of f 
as x approaches a exists and it equals l. 

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,294
Why is this thing called the Squeeze 
Theorem or some people call it the 

61
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:39,240
Sandwich Theorem or the Pinching Theorem? 
Let's take a look. 

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,899
Just pictorially, why is this called the 
squeeze theorem? 

63
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,311
I've got an example here. 
Three functions. 

64
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:51,804
G, F, and H. 
And again, G(x) is less than F(x), F(x) 

65
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:56,048
less than H(x). 
Now, note, the limit of G(x) as x 

66
00:04:56,048 --> 00:05:01,041
approaches A is L. 
And the limit of H(x) as x approaches A 

67
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,619
is L. 
F is squeezed, or sandwiched, between H 

68
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:08,197
and G. 
And consequently, the limit of f as x 

69
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:13,068
approaches A is also equal to L. 
Now, we're going to use the squeeze 

70
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:17,120
theorem to try to understand the limit of 
sin x over x. 

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,939
So we've got the Squeeze Theorem. 
And what do I know? 

72
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:27,408
I know that cosine X is less than sine x 
/ x is less than 1 for values of x that 

73
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:33,200
are close to but not equal to 0. 
And the limit of cosine x as x approaches 

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,714
0 is equal to 1. 
If you like, because cosines continuous 

75
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:44,353
and cosine of 0 is 1. 
Also the limit of 1 as x approaches 0 is 

76
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:51,582
equal to 1 because the limit of a 
constant function is that constant. 

77
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:59,320
So the limit of this function is one, the 
limit of this function is one as x 

78
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,818
approaches zero. 
And that means by the Squeeze Theorem, 

79
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:10,520
the limit of sine x / x is also equal to
