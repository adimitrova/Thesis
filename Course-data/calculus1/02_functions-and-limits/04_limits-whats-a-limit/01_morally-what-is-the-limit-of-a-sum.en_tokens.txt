there
are
subtleties
even
to
things
that
appear
as
simple
as
addition
.
here
,
i
've
got
some
addition
problems
.
4279
+
1202
,
4279
+
1190
,
4269
+
1207
,
+
1191
,
and
4270
+
1100
you
'll
notice
that
they
're
all
close
to
this
problem
.
the
numbers
that
i
've
been
listing
off
are
all
hovering
around
this
problem
.
anyway
,
i
'm
going
to
give
out
these
problems
to
some
people
and
have
them
try
to
do
them
.
[

hi
,
i
'm
[
unknown
]
and
i
'm
math
junior
undergraduate
at
ohio
state
.
[
music
]
yeah
.
my
name
is
jacob
turner
.
i
'm
a
graduate
ta
here
at
osu
.
[

alright
.
people
are
finished
doing
the
arithmetic
problems
.
let
's
record
the
answers
.
so
here
,
4270
+
1200
was
5470
.
4279
+
1202
was
5481.
the
next
one
is
5476
,
i
've
got
5467
,
and
the
last
one
was
5464.
what
do
all
these
numbers
have
in
common
?
they
're
all
really
close
together
.
is
that
just
an
accident
?
of
course
,
it
's
not
an
accident
,
right
?
here
's
the
fact
.
near
the
sum
of
two
numbers
is
the
sum
of
two
nearby
numbers
.
these
arithmetic
problems
are
not
just
random
arithmetic
problems
.
look
at
the
numbers
i
'm
asking
them
to
add
.
4277
and
1190
,
those
those
numbers
are
really
close
to
4273
and
1191.
which
is
really
close
to
4270
and
1200.
which
is
really
close
to
4269
and
1207
,
alright
?
near
the
sum
of
two
numbers
is
the
sum
of
two
nearby
numbers
,
all
of
the
answers
are
nearby
as
well
.
how
does
this
relate
to
limits
?
let
's
take
a
look
.
here
's
how
it
relates
to
limits
.
the
limit
of
f
of
x
plus
g
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
,
is
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
plus
the
limit
of
g
of
x
,
as
x
approaches
a.
how
is
this
related
to
those
arithmetic
problems
?
well
,
remember
what
this
limit
is
saying
.
this
is
saying
,
what
can
i
make
f
of
x
plus
g
of
x
close
to
,
if
i
'm
willing
to
make
x
sufficiently
close
to
a.
well
,
it
's
going
to
be
close
to
whatever
i
can
make
f
of
x
close
to
added
to
whatever
i
can
make
g
of
x
close
to
,
right
?
it
's
the
same
kind
of
setup
,
right
?
near
the
sum
of
two
values
is
the
sum
of
the
nearby
values
.
for
the
limit
of
a
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
.
we
can
use
this
fact
to
do
some
calculations
.
let
's
see
how
.
so
,
here
's
a
limit
problem
.
the
limit
of
x
squared
plus
x
as
x
approaches
two
.
i
really
want
you
to
resist
the
temptation
to
just
plug
in
two
.
we
're
going
to
be
using
our
limit
laws
to
try
to
evaluate
this
limit
.
now
,
this
is
the
limit
of
a
sum
,
and
the
limit
of
the
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
so
,
this
limit
of
x
squared
plus
x
is
equal
to
the
limit
of
x
squared
as
x
approaches
2
plus
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
2.
now
,
what
's
the
limit
of
x
squared
?
because
the
limit
of
the
products
is
also
the
product
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
,
this
is
the
limit
of
a
product
.
this
is
the
limit
of
x
times
x.
that
's
what
x
squared
means
,
it
's
x
times
x.
so
,
i
could
rewrite
this
as
the
limit
of
x
times
x
,
as
x
approaches
2+
.
now
what
's
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
2
?
this
is
asking
,
what
does
x
get
close
to
when
x
gets
close
to
2
?
or
,
some
more
precisely
,
what
can
i
guarantee
that
x
is
close
to
if
i
'm
willing
to
make
x
sufficiently
close
to
2
?
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
2
is
2
,
alright
?
so
,
this
limit
is
just
two
.
now
,
this
a
limit
of
a
product
,
and
the
limit
of
a
product
is
the
product
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
so
,
this
limit
is
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
2
times
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
to
+2
.
now
again
,
the
limit
of
x
as
x
approaches
two
,
right
?
what
can
i
guarantee
that
x
is
close
to
if
x
is
close
to
2
?
well
,
two
.
so
,
this
is
just
2.
this
limit
is
the
same
thing
,
it
's
again
just
2.
and
here
,
i
have
+2
.
2
*
2
+
2
is
6
,
which
is
the
value
of
the
limit
of
x
squared
plus
x
as
x
approaches
the
takeaway
message
here
is
ask
not
what
your
country
can
do
for
you
but
what
you
can
do
for
your
country
.
or
in
other
words
,
that
the
limit
of
a
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
it
's
the
same
rhetorical
device
right
,
x-y
,
y-x
.
alright
,
the
limit
of
a
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
limits
provided
the
limits
exist
.
i
hope
this
is
very
memorable
because
these
kinds
of
chiastic
rules
are
going
to
be
used
throughout
our
time
together
in
order
to
evaluate
limits
.
soon
,
we
're
going
to
see
that
the
same
sort
of
pattern
holds
not
just
for
sums
,
but
for
differences
,
for
products
and
almost
for
quotients
.
good
luck
.
