music there subtleties even to 
things that appear simple addition 
here, ive got addition problems 
, 
, 
, 
, 
youll notice that 
theyre close to this problem 
numbers that ive listing 
hovering around this problem 
anyway, im going to give 
problems to people try 
to 
music hi, im unknown im math 
junior undergraduate ohio state 
music yeah name is jacob turner 
im a graduate ta here osu 
music alright 
people finished arithmetic 
problems 
lets record answers 
so 
here, 

next one is , ive got , 
last one 
numbers in common 
theyre really close together 
is that an accident 
course, an accident, right 
heres fact 
near sum two numbers is sum 
two nearby numbers 
arithmetic problems 
random arithmetic problems 
look numbers im asking to 
add 
, 
numbers really close to 

is really close to 
is really close to , 
alright 
near sum two numbers is sum 
two nearby numbers, 
answers nearby well 
this relate to limits 
lets take a look 
heres relates to limits 
limit f x plus g x x 
approaches a, is limit f x x 
approaches a plus limit g x, 
x approaches a 
is this related to arithmetic 
problems 
well, remember this limit is saying 
this is saying, i make f x 
plus g x close to, if im willing to 
make x sufficiently close to a 
well, going to close to whatever 
i make f x close to added to 
whatever i make g x close to, 
right 
kind setup, right 
near sum two values is sum 
nearby values 
limit a sum is sum 
limits 
we use this fact to 
calculations 
lets see 
so, heres a limit problem 
limit x squared plus x x 
approaches two 
i really want you to resist 
temptation to plug in two 
going to using limit laws to 
try to evaluate this limit 
now, this is limit a sum, 
limit sum is sum limits 
provided limits exist 
so, this limit x squared plus x is 
equal to limit x squared x 
approaches plus limit x x 
approaches 
now, whats limit x squared 
limit products is also 
product limits provided 
limits exist, this is limit a 
product 
this is limit x times x 
thats x squared means, x times 
x 
so, i could rewrite this limit 
x times x, x approaches 
whats limit x x approaches 
this is asking, x get close to 
x gets close to 
or, precisely, i 
guarantee that x is close to if im 
willing to make x sufficiently close to 
limit x x approaches is , 
alright 
so, this limit is two 
now, this a limit a product, 
limit a product is product 
limits provided limits exist 
so, this limit is limit x x 
approaches times limit x x 
approaches to 
again, limit x x approaches 
two, right 
i guarantee that x is close to 
if x is close to 
well, two 
so, this is 
this limit is thing, 

here, i 
is , is value 
limit x squared plus x x approaches 
takeaway message here is ask 
country you you 
country 
in words, that limit a 
sum is sum limits provided 
limits exist 
rhetorical device right, 
xy, yx 
alright, limit a sum is sum 
limits provided limits exist 
i hope this is memorable 
kinds chiastic rules going 
to used throughout time together 
in order to evaluate limits 
soon, going to see that 
sort pattern holds sums, 
differences, products 
almost quotients 
good luck 
music
