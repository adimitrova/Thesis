sound so heres a table values 
function f x equals sin x 
f one is really sin one, like 
f is really sin one 
sin 
f 
this will sine , also 
f , is like sine , 
well thats more, right 
so question is numbers arent 
really getting close to anything in 
particular 
you really say that if you evaluate f 
values close to 
equal to zero, that outputs 
actually getting close to anything in 
particular 
i mean this is positive, negative, 
negative, positive, negative, positive, 
negative, looking pretty bad 
instead a table, lets look a 
graph 
here, ive got a graph funtcion f 
x sin x 
you see middle this graph is 
that horrible green blob 
right 
really hard to make detail 
you might think thats a consequence 
fact that im drawing this graph 
thick lines 
you know, if i used thinner lines to 
draw graph, maybe i could, you know 
get rid this green blob really see 
detail 
even if i dial size lines 
that im using to draw this graph, 
blob thing is still there, you know 
really there in graph 
function 
even if lines true lines, zero 
thickness, wouldnt possible to fit 
even a single atom next to y axis 
without touching graph this 
function 
graph is oscillating wildly near 
zero 
even if input is close to zero 
output could anything between 

so in light this evidence, limit 
sine x x approaches 
sound exist 
sometimes ill abbreviate dne, 
exist 
even mean to say doesnt 
exist 
we mean definition 
limit 
to say limit equals something means 
that i make output close i 
want to l making x close to a 
so i say this limit doesnt exist, i 
mean case that this limit is 
equal to anything, okay 
if you tell this limit is 
positive number, well look 
i evaluate function a number 
close to , output is negative 
so limit is probably 
positive number theres also inputs 
close to zero that give positive 
outputs so that limit is pulling 
a negative number either 
limit is pulling zero either cause 
none numbers getting close 
to zero 
so in this sense 
this limit doesnt exist 
case that this limit is 
equal to anything in particular 
if you tell this limit is equal to l, 
im going to show you numbers close to 
zero arent close to l 
lets see another example along 
lines 
this is a particularly confusing example 
in function fxx sine pi 
x 
function evaluated is 
thats pretty clear that is sine 
pi sine pi is zero 
function , im counting 
thats also equal to zero 
function , that is also zero 
this kind confusing 
you take a look here, i typed in sin 
pi divided to calculator 
this is calculating functions value 

if i ask calculator to this, is 
telling answer zero, right 
calculators giving this, 
admittedly, a small number, right, e 
here 
still actually zero 
so, i convince you that this is even 
true 
that functions value actually 
is equal to zero 
is f 
well sine, pi 
here im taking pi im dividing 

thats thing 
thats thing multiplying a 
im dividing a hundredth, thats 
multiplying a 
so this function is sine pi 
whats sine pi 
well, think back to graph 
sine looks like 
heres a graph sine, zero to two pi 
if i 
here is four pi, i drew 

here is six pi, im going to 
keep going 
eventually, im going to get to 
pi 
that point, sign really is going 
to equal to zero 
calculators great, theyre also 
terrible 
this calculator cant really calculate 
pi, is calculate 
approximation to pi 
we use human mind to evaluate 
this function exactly 
in light this evidence, you might 
tricked believing that limit 
fx x approaches is equal to 
points approaching 
zero, function evaluating 
points is zero 
so maybe that means that this is true 
so looks like limit is equal to 
zero 
but, happens if i look 
points 
well take a look this example 
heres function, f x equals 
sign pi x 
this function, if i evaluate is 
this, maybe a little bit mysterious 
number, negative so forth 
if i evaluate this function you 
get thing 
if i evaluate function , i 
get thing 
i get thing, , 
i get thing 
so, whats going here 
well is this number 
i mean 
this isnt sort random 
number 
right 
this is in fact negative square root 
three two 
looks like this function 
points value, negative 
square root three two 
so that mean that limit x 
approaches zero f x, sound is 
equal to negative square root 
three two 
sound i mean values, 
, input values 
approaching zero, functions value 
inputs is 
so, gives, is limit zero, is a 
negative point a, is 
okay, okay, ive little bit 
tricky in picking input points 
since function, f x equals 
sin pie x, here, i picking a 
collection points, approaching 
zero, , , , 
getting closer closer to zero 
now, output values looking 
pretty random 
i mean, same, 
instance 
so this is, maybe evidence, that, 
limit 
sine pi x x approaches zero 
doesnt exist 
here ive got a bunch input points 
that getting closer closer to 
zero output values least dont 
appear to getting close to 
learning 
exploring 
sound i encourage you to cook you 
examples 
weve seen a couple examples 
limits dont exist you come 

sound
