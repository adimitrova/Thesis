sound fundamentally, limits 
promises 
i tell you limit f x 
equals l, x approaches a im 
promising you something 
im promising you that i get f x 
close to l you like long x is 
close enough to a 
thinking limits promises helps us 
to understand statements like 
lets suppose that you tell that you 
know limit f x x approaches 
a is equal to something, maybe this is 
equal to l 
maybe limit g x x 
approaches a is equal to m 
that really is, is a promise that 
you make f x close to l i 
like 
a promise that you make g 
x close to m i like, long im 
willing to make x close enough to a 
if you promise that you 
make f x close to l, g x close 
to m 
i turn back promise you that 
f x plus g x is close to l plus 
m you like 
alright 
if i want to make this close to 
something, i ask you to make f x 
close enough to l, g x close 
enough to m 
so that f x plus g x, is you 
like to l plus m 
in words, limit a sum is 
sum limits 
limit a difference is 
difference limits 
limit a product is product 
limits 
quotient 
something similar is true 
division 
if limit f x x approaches a 
is l 
limit g x x approaches a 
is m, isnt zero, limit 
f x g x, x approaches a is 
l m 
in words, limit quotient 
is quotient limits, provided 
limits exist and, limit 
denominator is nonzero 
let us something new found 
knowledge limits quotients 
heres a limit problem im going to 
limit xsquared x plus one x 
approaches two, alright 
ill promise you that xsquared x 
plus one is close to something whenever x 
is close enough to two 
this is limit a quotient, 
limit quotients quotient 
limits, provided limit 
denominator is zero, in this 
case, 
so limit quotient is 
quotient limits 
sound heres limit 
numerator 
limit is x approaches two x plus 
one 
this is limit denominator 
this is limit x squared 
x squared is x times x 
this is a limit a product 
limit a products product 
to limits so i replace limit 
numerator a limit x x 
approaches two times limit x x 
approaches two 
this is limit x times x 
heres product limits 
limit x times limit x x 
approaches two 
denominator here is limit x 
plus one x approaches two thats a 
limit a sum limit sum 
is sum limits 
so limit x plus one sound is 
limit x plus limit one, x 
approaches two 
lets keep going 
so ive got limit x times 
limit x limit x plus 
limit one 
limits taken, 
x approaches two 
whats limit x 
thats asking you guarantee x is 
close to if youre willing to x 
close enough to two 
two is limit x x goes to two 
so limit x x goes to two is two 
limit x x goes to two is doubt 
is multiplying, divided limit x 
x approaches two plus limit 
one x approaches two 
this is asking, i guarantee one 
is close to two if i willing to x 
close enough to two 
well, one is already close to one, right 
limit a constant is that constant 
so this is one 
two times two is four 
two plus one is three 
so limit this expression is 
fourthirds 
this point you asking 
is rule limits quotients 
different limits products 
a limit a product is a product 
limits 
laws limits exist 
i to worry limit 
a nominator nonzero, im 
taking limit a quotient 
basically problem is that you 
cant divide zero 
you cant go around telling people that 
limit a quotient is a quotient 
limits limit 
denominator might zero youd 
telling people to divide zero, 
cant 
you cant divide zero 
you think even a little 
subtlety 
you know, lets kind unpack this a 
bit 
heres an example to think 
limit x x minus three x 
approaches six 
this is problem, alright 
numerator is a number close to six, 
thinking it, 
denominator is a number close to six 
minus three 
a number close to six minus three, that 
means denominator is a number close 
to three 
now, weve got a number close to six 
divided a number close to three 
well, thats a number close to two 
and, indeed, i mean, this limit is equal 
to two 
i make this quotient close to two 
i like 
i make numerator close 
to six i need, denominator is 
close to three i need, to guarantee 
that this ratio is close to two you 
like 
so that limit is two 
if instead asking 
limit x approaches six, id ask 
limit x approaches three 
well, would i know 
id know that numerator a 
number close to three, 
denominator a number close to three 
minus three 
denominators arent close to zero 
limited denominator is zero 
thats exactly scenario that rule 
taking limits quotients is 
forbidding us considering 
allowed to use rule 
limits quotients here 
limited denominator is zero 
really goes wrong 
i mean, yeah, i cant divide zero 
fine, im going to divide zero, 
im dividing numbers close to 
zero 
happens i divide numbers 
close to zero 
a number close to three divided a 
number close to zero 
is that close to anything 
if a numbers close to zero might 
positive, small 
three divided a small positive number 
is a huge positive number 
if denominator a number 
close to zero negative 
small, negative number close to 
zero 
three divided a small negative 
number 
that would a hugely negative number 
every negative 
well, this means this thing 
getting close to a gigantic positive 
number a very, negative number 
this thing isnt getting close to 
anything 
fundamentally thats problem 
is lost 
think this slightly harder example 
limit xsquared minus one x 
minus one x approaches one 
a limit a quotient 
so first temptation is to replace 
limit a quotient, quotient 
limits 
you cant replace without quotient 
limits, limit 
denominator is zero 
limit x x approaches one is 
equal to zero 
so seems like limit laws 
failed us 
we got one trick 
sleeve 
look numerator 
x squared one that factors x 
times, x 
first record that fact 
i going to record fact that 
numerator factor is x times x 
ive still got a limit a quotient 
limit denominator is still 
zero 
so seems like stuck 
ive got a factor x minus one 
in numerator a factor x minus 
one in denominator, i use 
that fact 
i want to is imagine canceling 
these, right 
id like to write that this is equal to 
limit x plus one, x goes 
to one 
note, actually 
function 
alright 
this thing here is defined one, 
this thing is defined one 
yet limit doesnt care 
limit depends upon values 
function near one 
near one, this this exactly 

im allowed to plug one this, i 
allowed to plug one this 
theyre different functions 
functions equal if youre 
considering values that near 
equal to one 
a result, limits 
this is another limit a sum, 
limit a sum is sum limits, 
so this is limit x plus limit 
one x approaches one 
limit x x approaches one is 
one 
limit one, is a constant, 
x approaches one is one 
this is one plus one 
this is two 
so that limit is equal to two 
limit laws saved day 
sound
