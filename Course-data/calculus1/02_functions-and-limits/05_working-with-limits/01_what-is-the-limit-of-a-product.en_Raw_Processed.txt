here is an arithmetic problem, 
im going give this exercise to bart 
so, product is 
but, if i perturb inputs a 
little bit 
instead assigning this multiplication 
exercise, i could assigned this 
multiplication exercise, 
lets give this to somebody else 
hi 
name is vadranna 
so, is , 
isnt so far answer that 
bart got multiplied times 
got , 
so, look this 
weve got two different problems 
input to multiplication 
problems similar, 
outputs also similar 
lets more, similar 
multiplication problems 
sound hello, name is sean gory 
sound oh, this is great 
look 
we multiplied pairs 
nearby numbers, result 
multiplications also nearby 
theres a limit lesson hiding 
this 
if limit f x x approaches a 
is l, limit g x x 
approaches a is m, limit f 
x times g x x approaches a is equal 
to l times m 
in words, limit a product is 
product limits provided 
limits exist sound
