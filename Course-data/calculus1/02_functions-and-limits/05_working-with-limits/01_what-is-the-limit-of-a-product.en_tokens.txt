here
is
an
arithmetic
problem
,
660
*
310.
i
'm
going
give
this
exercise
to
bart
.
so
,
the
product
of
660
and
310
is
but
,
what
if
i
perturb
these
inputs
a
little
bit
?
instead
of
assigning
this
multiplication
exercise
,
i
could
have
assigned
this
multiplication
exercise
,
664
*
311.
let
's
give
this
to
somebody
else
.
hi
.
my
name
is
vadranna
.
so
,
664
*
311
is
206,504.
which
is
n't
so
far
off
of
the
answer
that
bart
got
when
he
multiplied
660
times
310
and
got
204,600.
so
,
look
at
this
.
we
've
got
two
different
problems
.
the
input
to
these
multiplication
problems
are
similar
,
the
outputs
are
also
similar
.
let
's
do
some
more
,
very
similar
multiplication
problems
.

hello
,
my
name
is
sean
gory
.
[

oh
,
this
is
great
.
look
.
we
multiplied
all
of
these
pairs
of
nearby
numbers
,
and
the
result
of
the
multiplications
were
also
nearby
.
there
's
a
limit
lesson
hiding
at
all
of
this
.
if
the
limit
of
f
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
is
l
,
and
the
limit
of
g
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
is
m
,
then
the
limit
of
f
of
x
times
g
of
x
as
x
approaches
a
is
equal
to
l
times
m.
in
other
words
,
the
limit
of
a
product
is
the
product
of
the
limits
provided
those
limits
exist
