1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
[SOUND] Fundamentally, limits are 
promises. 

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,564
When I tell you the limit of F of X 
equals L, as X approaches A; I'm 

3
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:13,593
promising you something. 
I'm promising you that I can get F of X 

4
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:18,308
as close to L as you like as long as X is 
close enough to A. 

5
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:24,280
Thinking of limits as promises helps us 
to understand statements like these. 

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,768
Let's suppose that you tell me that you 
know the limit of f of x as x approaches 

7
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,484
a is equal to something, maybe this is 
equal to l. 

8
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:34,920
And maybe the limit of g of x as x 
approaches a is equal to m. 

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,120
What that really is, is a promise that 
you can make F of X as close to L as I 

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,294
like. 
And it's a promise that you can make G of 

11
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:48,495
X as close to M as I like, as long as I'm 
willing to make X close enough to A. 

12
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:53,830
But if you can promise me that you can 
make F of X close to L, and G of X close 

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,005
to M. 
Then I can turn back and promise you that 

14
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,720
F of X plus G of X is as close to L plus 
M as you like. 

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,442
Alright? 
If I want to make this close to 

16
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:08,547
something, I just ask you to make F of X 
close enough to L, and G of X close 

17
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:11,882
enough to M. 
So that F of X plus G of X, is as you 

18
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:15,540
like to L plus M. 
In other words, the limit of a sum is the 

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,492
sum of the limits. 
And the limit of a difference is the 

20
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:22,088
difference of the limits. 
And the limit of a product is the product 

21
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,258
of the limits. 
And what about quotient. 

22
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:28,481
And something similar is true for 
division. 

23
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,929
If the limit of F of X as X approaches A 
is L. 

24
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:38,074
And the limit of G of X as X approaches A 
is M, which isn't zero, then the limit of 

25
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:41,747
F of X over G of X, as X approaches A is 
L over M. 

26
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:47,743
In other words, the limit of the quotient 
is the quotient of the limits, provided 

27
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:52,540
those limits exist and, the limit of the 
denominator is non-zero. 

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,249
Let us do something with our new found 
knowledge about limits of quotients. 

29
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:01,645
Here's a limit problem: I'm going to 
limit x-squared over x plus one as x 

30
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:05,538
approaches two, alright? 
I'll promise you that x-squared over x 

31
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:09,620
plus one is close to something whenever x 
is close enough to two. 

32
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,848
This is the limit of a quotient, and the 
limit of the quotient's the quotient of 

33
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:19,619
the limits, provided the limit of the 
denominator is not zero, and in this 

34
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,887
case, it's not. 
So the limit of the quotient is the 

35
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:26,482
quotient of the limits. 
[SOUND] Here's the limit of the 

36
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:29,750
numerator. 
The limit is X approaches two of X plus 

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,430
one. 
This is the limit of the denominator. 

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,804
Now this is the limit of x squared. 
X squared is X times X. 

39
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:41,577
This is a limit of a product. 
And the limit of a products the product 

40
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:46,917
to the limits so I can replace the limit 
of the numerator with a limit of X as X 

41
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,609
approaches two times the limit of X as X 
approaches two. 

42
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,895
because this is the limit of X times X 
and here's the product limits. 

43
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,323
Limit of X times the limit of X as X 
approaches two. 

44
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:03,664
The denominator here is the limit of X 
plus one as X approaches two but that's a 

45
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:07,950
limit of a sum and the limit of the sum 
is the sum of the limits. 

46
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:16,076
So the limit of X plus one [SOUND] is the 
limit of X plus the limit of one, as X 

47
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:19,090
approaches two. 
Lets keep going. 

48
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,129
So I've got the limit of X times the 
limit of X over the limit of X plus the 

49
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,910
limit of one. 
And all of these limits are being taken, 

50
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,524
as X approaches two. 
What's the limit of X? 

51
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:34,357
That's asking what can you guarantee X is 
close to if you're willing to have X be 

52
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:38,482
close enough to two? 
Two is the limit of X as X goes to two. 

53
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:43,957
So limit of X as X goes to two is two. 
The limit of X as X goes to two is doubt 

54
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:49,571
is for multiplying, divided by limit of X 
as X approaches two plus with the limit 

55
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:54,214
of one as X approaches two. 
This is asking, what can I guarantee one 

56
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:58,719
is close to two if I am willing to have X 
be close enough to two. 

57
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,263
Well, one is already close to one, right. 
The limit of a constant is that constant. 

58
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:07,159
So this is just one. 
Two times two is four. 

59
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,344
Two plus one is three. 
And so the limit of this expression is 

60
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:15,049
four-thirds. 
At this point you are asking yourself why 

61
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,126
is the rule for limits of quotients 
different than limits of the products. 

62
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,419
A limit of a product is a product of the 
limits. 

63
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,110
Laws of limits exist. 
Why do I have to worry about the limit of 

64
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,300
a nominator being non-zero, when I'm 
taking the limit of a quotient? 

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,544
Most basically the problem is that you 
can't divide by zero. 

66
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:38,925
You can't go around telling people that 
the limit of a quotient is a quotient of 

67
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:43,089
the limits because the limit of the 
denominator might be zero and then you'd 

68
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,117
be telling people to divide by zero, 
which they can't do. 

69
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:49,878
You can't divide by zero. 
But you can think about it even a little 

70
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:52,670
more subtlety. 
You know, let's kind of unpack this a 

71
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,914
bit. 
Here's an example to think about: the 

72
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:57,651
limit of x over x minus three as x 
approaches six. 

73
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:01,263
This is no problem, alright? 
The numerator is a number close to six, 

74
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:05,533
it's how we're thinking about it, and the 
denominator is a number close to six 

75
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,341
minus three. 
A number close to six minus three, that 

76
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,044
means the denominator is a number close 
to three. 

77
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,961
Now, we've got a number close to six 
divided by a number close to three. 

78
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,933
Well, that's a number close to two. 
And, indeed, I mean, this limit is equal 

79
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,580
to two. 
I can make this quotient as close to two 

80
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,449
as I like. 
Because I can make the numerator as close 

81
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,697
to six as I need, the denominator is as 
close to three as I need, to guarantee 

82
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:31,290
that this ratio is as close to two as you 
like. 

83
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,202
So that limit is two. 
But what if instead of asking about the 

84
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:42,000
limit as x approaches six, I'd ask about 
the limit as x approaches three. 

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,772
Well, then what would I know? 
Then I'd know that the numerator was a 

86
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:49,714
number close to three, and the 
denominator was a number close to three 

87
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,657
minus three. 
The denominators aren't close to zero. 

88
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:57,071
The limited denominator is zero. 
That's exactly the scenario that the rule 

89
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,949
for taking limits of quotients is 
forbidding us from considering. 

90
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,424
We're not allowed to use the rule for 
limits of quotients here because the 

91
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,705
limited denominator is zero. 
But what really goes wrong? 

92
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:12,822
I mean, yeah, I can't divide by zero. 
Fine, I'm not going to divide by zero, 

93
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,387
I'm just dividing by numbers close to 
zero. 

94
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:18,728
But what happens when I divide by numbers 
close to zero? 

95
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,188
A number close to three divided by a 
number close to zero. 

96
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:26,671
Is that close to anything? 
If a number's close to zero it might be 

97
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:31,434
positive, and very small. 
Three divided by a small positive number 

98
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:36,380
is a huge positive number. 
What if the denominator were a number 

99
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,824
close to zero but negative? 
Very small, negative number close to 

100
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:43,857
zero. 
Three divided by a small but negative 

101
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:47,101
number? 
That would be a hugely negative number. 

102
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:50,558
Every negative. 
Well, this means this thing should be 

103
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:55,109
getting close to both a gigantic positive 
number and a very, very negative number. 

104
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,525
This thing isn't getting close to 
anything. 

105
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:00,503
Fundamentally that's the problem but not 
all is lost. 

106
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:05,054
Think about this slightly harder example: 
the limit of x-squared minus one over x 

107
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:08,261
minus one as x approaches one. 
It's a limit of a quotient. 

108
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,711
So your first temptation is to replace 
the limit of a quotient, by the quotient 

109
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:16,596
of the limits. 
But you can't replace it without quotient 

110
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:20,651
of limits, because the limit of the 
denominator is zero. 

111
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,632
The limit of X-1 as X approaches one is 
equal to zero. 

112
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:28,097
So it seems like our limit laws have 
failed us. 

113
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:31,783
And then we have got one more trick up 
our sleeve. 

114
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:35,838
Look at the numerator. 
X squared - one that factors as X+1 

115
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:38,271
times, X-1. 
First record that fact. 

116
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:43,580
And I am going to record the fact that 
the numerator factor is X+1 times X-1. 

117
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,980
Now I've still got a limit of a quotient 
and the limit of the denominator is still 

118
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,192
zero. 
So it seems like we're stuck. 

119
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:56,527
But now I've got a factor of X minus one 
in the numerator and a factor of X minus 

120
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,586
one in the denominator, and I can use 
that fact. 

121
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:02,904
What I want to do is imagine canceling 
these, right. 

122
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:08,044
I'd like to write that this is equal to 
the limit of just X plus one, as X goes 

123
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:11,452
to one. 
But note, these are not actually the same 

124
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,676
function. 
Alright? 

125
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:17,717
This thing up here is not defined at one, 
this thing is defined at one. 

126
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:22,974
And yet the limit doesn't care. 
The limit only depends upon values of the 

127
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:27,078
function near one. 
And near one, this and this are exactly 

128
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:30,607
the same. 
I'm not allowed to plug one into this, I 

129
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:35,280
am allowed to plug one into this. 
They're different functions. 

130
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,605
But those functions are equal if you're 
only considering values that are near and 

131
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:44,104
not equal to one. 
As a result, these limits are the same. 

132
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:49,083
This is another limit of a sum, and the 
limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, 

133
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,369
so this is the limit of X plus the limit 
of one as X approaches one. 

134
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:56,016
The limit of X as X approaches one is 
one. 

135
00:08:56,016 --> 00:09:00,050
The limit of one, which is a constant, as 
X approaches one is one. 

136
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,130
This is one plus one. 
This is two. 

137
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:15,860
And so that limit is equal to two and our 
limit laws have again saved the day. 

138
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,269
[SOUND]
