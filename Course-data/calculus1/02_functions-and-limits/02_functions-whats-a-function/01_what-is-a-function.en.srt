1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,845
[MUSIC] Calculus study functions and this 
course is no exception. 

2
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:09,093
We're going to be studying functions in 
this course, alright? 

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:14,385
Functions like f of x or the sine 
function or the square root function. 

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:19,156
And that raises a question what are 
functions?If If we're going to be 

5
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:22,734
studying functions, we should know what 
they are. 

6
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:27,504
And that question is pretty metaphysical. 
I mean what are numbers? 

7
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:31,332
What are numbers for? 
I mean that question doesn't make a lot 

8
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,443
of sense does it? 
I, you know, it's not like a number four 

9
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:38,969
is a physical object that I can go look 
at it and see if it's got polka dots or 

10
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,779
it's striped or something, 
right? 

11
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,381
But I know four objects when I see them, 
right? 

12
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:47,906
I sort understand what numbers do more 
than what they are in some metaphysical 

13
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:50,112
sense. 
The same is true about functions, 

14
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:52,545
right? 
I'm not really going to tell you what a 

15
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:55,147
function is. 
What I'm going to tell you is what a 

16
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,579
function does. 
This is what a function does. 

17
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,200
A function assigns to each number in its 
domain another number. 

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,788
And this definition doesn't say anything 
about how the function does that 

19
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:08,068
assignment. 
Let's see an example. 

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,168
Just make up some example. 
Suppose I've got some function, I'll call 

21
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:17,888
it f, f for function. 
Maybe this function assigns to the number 

22
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:23,673
two, the number four. 
So, I'll write f(2) is 4 or f(3) is 9 Or 

23
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:28,545
f(4) is 16 of f(5) is 25. 
I'm just making this up. 

24
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:32,380
This is a function. 
And I'm telling you what number it 

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,170
assigns to each number, 
right? 

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,701
f assigns the number two, the number 
four. 

27
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:40,529
f(3) is 9, right? 
So, f assigns to the number three, the 

28
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:41,887
number nine. 
Well, look, 

29
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm not going to just list off every 
single assignment that f makes. 

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,539
So instead, one way to talk about these 
assignments is to use a rule, like f(x) = 

31
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,443
x^2. 
And this single rule explains how all of 

32
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:58,968
these assignments are made, 
alright? 

33
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:03,062
This rule said that f assigns to the 
number x, the number x^2. 

34
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:07,644
So in particular, f assigns the number 
five, five squared or 25, or f assigns 

35
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:12,287
the number four, four squared which is 
sixteen or f assigns the number three, 

36
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:16,685
three squared which is nine, alright? 
So, a lot of times, when you actually 

37
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:21,451
want to talk about how these assignments 
are being made, use some sort of rule 

38
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:25,850
like this: and you write f of x is 
something, to compute the output value, 

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,000
right? 
So, a function assigns to each number in 

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
its domain another number. 
One way to do that is with a rule. 

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,700
Of course, this definition of function 
involves another word, domain. 

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,103
What is a domain? 
Unless, I say otherwise, the domain 

43
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:44,774
consists of all numbers for which the 
rule makes sense, 

44
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,911
right? 
A function assigns to each number in its 

45
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,272
domain another number. 
And the domain is just the numbers that I 

46
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,852
can plug in. 
Let's take a look to see what I mean by 

47
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,846
this. 
Suppose I've got a function f(x) = 1 / x. 

48
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,942
So, that's a function given by a rule. 
It takes an input x and produces the 

49
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,595
output 1 / x, 
right? 

50
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:09,762
It assigns the number x, the number 1 / 
x. 

51
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,930
But this rule doesn't always make sense, 
right? 

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,435
I'm dividing by x, 
alright? 

53
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:22,080
And to divide by x, what do I need? 
Well, 

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:30,175
I must have that x is not zero, 
not permitted to divide by zero. 

55
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:34,855
So, I can plug in any number for x except 
for zero. 

56
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:41,970
And that's when this rule makes sense. 
So, I'll summarize that by saying that 

57
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,042
the domain of f is all real numbers 
except zero. 

58
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:51,416
So, a function takes some input and 
produces some output. 

59
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:55,091
That's what it does. 
But how is that supposed to make us feel, 

60
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,802
you know? 
How are we supposed to imagine that? 

61
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:02,741
Well, here's one metaphor that you could 
use to try to think about what a function 

62
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,657
is actually doing, right? 
You could imagine a, a conveyor belt with 

63
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:07,982
the function, 
you know, 

64
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,633
And you could imagine the numbers coming 
in. 

65
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,404
Boom. 
Being hit by the function and then going 

66
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:17,260
out transformed somehow, by whatever the 
rule is of the function. 

67
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,594
Here's what I'm talking about. 
I've got a conveyor belt here, I got this 

68
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,769
big box, and imagine if that big box is 
the function. 

69
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,127
And in here, I've got the input, imagine 
the number five. 

70
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,569
Let's see what this machine is going to 
do. 

71
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:36,247
Maybe this is the function f(x) = x^2 + x 
and I've got this number five here. 

72
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:40,765
And I'll start the conveyer belt going so 
the number five starts moving through the 

73
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:45,283
machine and when the machine is done 
processing it, it comes out the other 

74
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:48,370
side and now, it's the number 30, 
alright. 

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:56,090
Because f(5) is 5^2 + 5, which is 25 + 5 
is 20. 

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,610
So, we have seen how you can write down a 
function by using a, a rule involving 

77
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,510
these, these mathematical symbols, 
right? 

78
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,250
x^2 + x. 
You can also write down a function just 

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,140
using English words. 
So, let's see an example of that, just 

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,986
make up a new function here. 
I'll call it R(x) and I'll define ÂˇÂ R(x) 

81
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:21,354
to be thrice, that means three times, 
thrice the square root of x. 

82
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,995
And here, I've computed some, some values 
of the function, you know, like the 

83
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:28,861
function that four is six. 
Well, why is that? 

84
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:34,389
Well, R(4) would be three times the 
square root of four, which is three times 

85
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,459
two which is six. 
Okay. Now, of course, when I do the 

86
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,974
calculation this way, you know, it's not 
too surprising that instead of writing 

87
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,636
this out in words, thrice the square root 
of x, 

88
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,456
I mean I could have just written three 
times the square root of x. 

89
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,002
So, maybe you're not too impressed with 
this. 

90
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:55,285
The point is that you can define a 
function just by writing down what the 

91
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:58,005
function is supposed to do using English 
words. 

92
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:02,635
So, we've seen an example of a function 
that we defined just in terms of algebra, 

93
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:07,023
f(x) = x^2 + x. 
I've also seen an example of a function 

94
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:10,070
that I define entirely with just English 
words. 

95
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,769
We can kind of combine those two things, 
alright? 

96
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,044
We can use the English to sort of pick 
out different kinds of of algebra. 

97
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:21,902
Let's see an example of that now. 
So, here's another function I just made 

98
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:25,136
up. 
g(x) is x^22 if x is bigger than or equal 

99
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:28,446
to five. 
And twice x if x is less than five. 

100
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:33,220
The point here is that I'm using just a 
little bit of English. 

101
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,608
So, this word, if, in order to select 
based on how big x is, 

102
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:42,795
a different algebraic rule for 
calculating the function and this is a 

103
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:46,612
little abstract. 
Let me just do with some calculations and 

104
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:50,053
that might convince you, you know, how, 
how this notation is, 

105
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,870
this so-called piecewise notation works. 
So, what is g(1)? 

106
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,581
Well, let's take a look. 
One is less than five so that means I use 

107
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:03,656
this second rule for calculating g, 
so it's two times one which is two. 

108
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:08,005
What's g of, say, four? 
Well, four is still less than five so I 

109
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:12,790
use the second rule again. 
Twice the input, two times four and that 

110
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,502
means the output is eight. 
But what is, say, g(5)? 

111
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,853
Ooh. 
Five is not less than five. 

112
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:24,466
Five is greater than or equal to five. 
So, this if is telling me to use the 

113
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:30,382
first of the two rules for calculating g 
so I'm going to use five squared as the 

114
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:33,442
output and that will be 25. 
Or g(10). 

115
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:38,708
Well, ten is definitely bigger than or 
equal to five and it's bigger than five. 

116
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,907
So, I again use the first rule and the 
output to this function is computed as 

117
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:47,350
ten squared or 100. 
So, this is, you know, really more 

118
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,523
complicated than just using some algebra, 
right? 

119
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:55,857
I'm using these if statements to select 
which of these two rules g will use to 

120
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:59,669
compute its output. 
in principle, functions can be really 

121
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,359
complicated. 
I mean, all the examples we've seen are 

122
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,893
just doing various kinds of algebra. 
I mean, maybe different algebra, 

123
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,424
depending upon which value of x I'm 
plugging in. 

124
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:11,958
But it's all, you know, adding, 
subtracting, multiplying, dividing that 

125
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,648
sort of thing. 
But you can do really complicated things 

126
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:18,234
with, with functions. 
let's see an example of something that is 

127
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:21,241
you know really different than doing 
straight up algebra. 

128
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,034
I'll do a much crazier example. 
Alright. 

129
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,990
C(x) is the number of even digits in the 
number x, when x is a whole number. 

130
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,411
It is zero if x isn't a whole number, so 
otherwise. 

131
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,832
And it is a really different and crazy 
function, right? 

132
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:36,296
So, C of, say, 7236 is two, and why is 
that? 

133
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:40,333
This is a whole number so I use the first 
part of the rule. 

134
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,412
And the number of even digits in this 
number, 

135
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:45,396
well, I count them. 
That's odd, 

136
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:46,012
even, 
odd, 

137
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:49,023
even. 
So, two and six are the two even digits. 

138
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:53,917
The value of that function is two. 
Well, let's take a look at this number 

139
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,160
here, 60,202. 
That again is a whole number, so the 

140
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,620
value of the function at 60,202 is the 
number of even digits in x. 

141
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,822
And this number has how many even digits? 
One, two, three, four, five, they're all 

142
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:10,926
even digits so that value is five. 
Here's another example. 

143
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,220
Here's another 5-digit number. 
53,531. 

144
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,932
Again, it's a whole number so I use the 
first part of the rule, the number of 

145
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,970
even digits. 
I count how many of these digits are 

146
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,016
even. 
Five is odd, odd, odd, odd, odd. 

147
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:27,108
There are no even digits. 
So, the value of this function is zero at 

148
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,984
this point. 
Now, if I plug in a number that's not a 

149
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:34,203
whole number like this, this is not a 
whole number, then I use the otherwise 

150
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:37,722
part of the definition. 
And the function at that point is just a 

151
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,885
zero. 
So, we can use English to define a 

152
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:43,710
function but you got to be careful, 
alright? Sometimes, when you write 

153
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,986
another definition of a function, you 
might write down something that's more 

154
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,755
ambiguous than, than you intended. 
So, let's try to define a function. 

155
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:55,355
Just making this stuff up, I'll call the 
function B(x) for bad. 

156
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:59,800
And I'll say that the value of B(x) is 
some rearrangement of the digits of x. 

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,376
And it's okay that I'm using English to 
define my functions. 

158
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:06,531
There's nothing wrong with that. 
But this definition is too ambiguous to 

159
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:11,678
be the definition of a function. 
here's a definition of what goes wrong. 

160
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:16,755
What is the function's value at 352? 
Well, the function takes its input and 

161
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:21,902
rearranges the digits somehow, alright? 
So, you might think that the functions 

162
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:26,144
value at 352 is 325. 
Because 325 is some rearrangement of the 

163
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:31,152
digits of 352, right, I took the five and 
the two, swapped their positions. 

164
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:36,229
But then, the functions value at 352 
should also be 235 because 235 is also a 

165
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:40,871
rearrangement of 352. 
The function's value with 352 should also 

166
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:45,872
be 532 because 532 is some rearrangement 
of the digits of 352. 

167
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,021
This is terrible, 
alright? 

168
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:56,854
A function is suppose to take its input 
and produce unambiguously a single output 

169
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:01,701
value. 
But this so-called function takes this 

170
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:09,348
single input value and purportedly 
produces all these possible outputs. 

171
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:13,010
This thing here is not a function, 
alright? 

172
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,504
A function takes one input and produces 
one output. 

173
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:19,366
