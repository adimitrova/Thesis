calculus
study
functions
and
this
course
is
no
exception
.
we
're
going
to
be
studying
functions
in
this
course
,
alright
?
functions
like
f
of
x
or
the
sine
function
or
the
square
root
function
.
and
that
raises
a
question
what
are
functions
?
if
if
we
're
going
to
be
studying
functions
,
we
should
know
what
they
are
.
and
that
question
is
pretty
metaphysical
.
i
mean
what
are
numbers
?
what
are
numbers
for
?
i
mean
that
question
does
n't
make
a
lot
of
sense
does
it
?
i
,
you
know
,
it
's
not
like
a
number
four
is
a
physical
object
that
i
can
go
look
at
it
and
see
if
it
's
got
polka
dots
or
it
's
striped
or
something
,
right
?
but
i
know
four
objects
when
i
see
them
,
right
?
i
sort
understand
what
numbers
do
more
than
what
they
are
in
some
metaphysical
sense
.
the
same
is
true
about
functions
,
right
?
i
'm
not
really
going
to
tell
you
what
a
function
is
.
what
i
'm
going
to
tell
you
is
what
a
function
does
.
this
is
what
a
function
does
.
a
function
assigns
to
each
number
in
its
domain
another
number
.
and
this
definition
does
n't
say
anything
about
how
the
function
does
that
assignment
.
let
's
see
an
example
.
just
make
up
some
example
.
suppose
i
've
got
some
function
,
i
'll
call
it
f
,
f
for
function
.
maybe
this
function
assigns
to
the
number
two
,
the
number
four
.
so
,
i
'll
write
f
(
2
)
is
4
or
f
(
3
)
is
9
or
f
(
4
)
is
16
of
f
(
5
)
is
25.
i
'm
just
making
this
up
.
this
is
a
function
.
and
i
'm
telling
you
what
number
it
assigns
to
each
number
,
right
?
f
assigns
the
number
two
,
the
number
four
.
f
(
3
)
is
9
,
right
?
so
,
f
assigns
to
the
number
three
,
the
number
nine
.
well
,
look
,
i
'm
not
going
to
just
list
off
every
single
assignment
that
f
makes
.
so
instead
,
one
way
to
talk
about
these
assignments
is
to
use
a
rule
,
like
f
(
x
)
=
x^2
.
and
this
single
rule
explains
how
all
of
these
assignments
are
made
,
alright
?
this
rule
said
that
f
assigns
to
the
number
x
,
the
number
x^2
.
so
in
particular
,
f
assigns
the
number
five
,
five
squared
or
25
,
or
f
assigns
the
number
four
,
four
squared
which
is
sixteen
or
f
assigns
the
number
three
,
three
squared
which
is
nine
,
alright
?
so
,
a
lot
of
times
,
when
you
actually
want
to
talk
about
how
these
assignments
are
being
made
,
use
some
sort
of
rule
like
this
:
and
you
write
f
of
x
is
something
,
to
compute
the
output
value
,
right
?
so
,
a
function
assigns
to
each
number
in
its
domain
another
number
.
one
way
to
do
that
is
with
a
rule
.
of
course
,
this
definition
of
function
involves
another
word
,
domain
.
what
is
a
domain
?
unless
,
i
say
otherwise
,
the
domain
consists
of
all
numbers
for
which
the
rule
makes
sense
,
right
?
a
function
assigns
to
each
number
in
its
domain
another
number
.
and
the
domain
is
just
the
numbers
that
i
can
plug
in
.
let
's
take
a
look
to
see
what
i
mean
by
this
.
suppose
i
've
got
a
function
f
(
x
)
=
1
/
x.
so
,
that
's
a
function
given
by
a
rule
.
it
takes
an
input
x
and
produces
the
output
1
/
x
,
right
?
it
assigns
the
number
x
,
the
number
1
/
x.
but
this
rule
does
n't
always
make
sense
,
right
?
i
'm
dividing
by
x
,
alright
?
and
to
divide
by
x
,
what
do
i
need
?
well
,
i
must
have
that
x
is
not
zero
,
not
permitted
to
divide
by
zero
.
so
,
i
can
plug
in
any
number
for
x
except
for
zero
.
and
that
's
when
this
rule
makes
sense
.
so
,
i
'll
summarize
that
by
saying
that
the
domain
of
f
is
all
real
numbers
except
zero
.
so
,
a
function
takes
some
input
and
produces
some
output
.
that
's
what
it
does
.
but
how
is
that
supposed
to
make
us
feel
,
you
know
?
how
are
we
supposed
to
imagine
that
?
well
,
here
's
one
metaphor
that
you
could
use
to
try
to
think
about
what
a
function
is
actually
doing
,
right
?
you
could
imagine
a
,
a
conveyor
belt
with
the
function
,
you
know
,
and
you
could
imagine
the
numbers
coming
in
.
boom
.
being
hit
by
the
function
and
then
going
out
transformed
somehow
,
by
whatever
the
rule
is
of
the
function
.
here
's
what
i
'm
talking
about
.
i
've
got
a
conveyor
belt
here
,
i
got
this
big
box
,
and
imagine
if
that
big
box
is
the
function
.
and
in
here
,
i
've
got
the
input
,
imagine
the
number
five
.
let
's
see
what
this
machine
is
going
to
do
.
maybe
this
is
the
function
f
(
x
)
=
x^2
+
x
and
i
've
got
this
number
five
here
.
and
i
'll
start
the
conveyer
belt
going
so
the
number
five
starts
moving
through
the
machine
and
when
the
machine
is
done
processing
it
,
it
comes
out
the
other
side
and
now
,
it
's
the
number
30
,
alright
.
because
f
(
5
)
is
5^2
+
5
,
which
is
25
+
5
is
20.
so
,
we
have
seen
how
you
can
write
down
a
function
by
using
a
,
a
rule
involving
these
,
these
mathematical
symbols
,
right
?
x^2
+
x.
you
can
also
write
down
a
function
just
using
english
words
.
so
,
let
's
see
an
example
of
that
,
just
make
up
a
new
function
here
.
i
'll
call
it
r
(
x
)
and
i
'll
define
Ã£ÂÃ
«
ÂÃ£ÂÃ¢Â
r
(
x
)
to
be
thrice
,
that
means
three
times
,
thrice
the
square
root
of
x.
and
here
,
i
've
computed
some
,
some
values
of
the
function
,
you
know
,
like
the
function
that
four
is
six
.
well
,
why
is
that
?
well
,
r
(
4
)
would
be
three
times
the
square
root
of
four
,
which
is
three
times
two
which
is
six
.
okay
.
now
,
of
course
,
when
i
do
the
calculation
this
way
,
you
know
,
it
's
not
too
surprising
that
instead
of
writing
this
out
in
words
,
thrice
the
square
root
of
x
,
i
mean
i
could
have
just
written
three
times
the
square
root
of
x.
so
,
maybe
you
're
not
too
impressed
with
this
.
the
point
is
that
you
can
define
a
function
just
by
writing
down
what
the
function
is
supposed
to
do
using
english
words
.
so
,
we
've
seen
an
example
of
a
function
that
we
defined
just
in
terms
of
algebra
,
f
(
x
)
=
x^2
+
x.
i
've
also
seen
an
example
of
a
function
that
i
define
entirely
with
just
english
words
.
we
can
kind
of
combine
those
two
things
,
alright
?
we
can
use
the
english
to
sort
of
pick
out
different
kinds
of
of
algebra
.
let
's
see
an
example
of
that
now
.
so
,
here
's
another
function
i
just
made
up
.
g
(
x
)
is
x^22
if
x
is
bigger
than
or
equal
to
five
.
and
twice
x
if
x
is
less
than
five
.
the
point
here
is
that
i
'm
using
just
a
little
bit
of
english
.
so
,
this
word
,
if
,
in
order
to
select
based
on
how
big
x
is
,
a
different
algebraic
rule
for
calculating
the
function
and
this
is
a
little
abstract
.
let
me
just
do
with
some
calculations
and
that
might
convince
you
,
you
know
,
how
,
how
this
notation
is
,
this
so-called
piecewise
notation
works
.
so
,
what
is
g
(
1
)
?
well
,
let
's
take
a
look
.
one
is
less
than
five
so
that
means
i
use
this
second
rule
for
calculating
g
,
so
it
's
two
times
one
which
is
two
.
what
's
g
of
,
say
,
four
?
well
,
four
is
still
less
than
five
so
i
use
the
second
rule
again
.
twice
the
input
,
two
times
four
and
that
means
the
output
is
eight
.
but
what
is
,
say
,
g
(
5
)
?
ooh
.
five
is
not
less
than
five
.
five
is
greater
than
or
equal
to
five
.
so
,
this
if
is
telling
me
to
use
the
first
of
the
two
rules
for
calculating
g
so
i
'm
going
to
use
five
squared
as
the
output
and
that
will
be
25.
or
g
(
10
)
.
well
,
ten
is
definitely
bigger
than
or
equal
to
five
and
it
's
bigger
than
five
.
so
,
i
again
use
the
first
rule
and
the
output
to
this
function
is
computed
as
ten
squared
or
100.
so
,
this
is
,
you
know
,
really
more
complicated
than
just
using
some
algebra
,
right
?
i
'm
using
these
if
statements
to
select
which
of
these
two
rules
g
will
use
to
compute
its
output
.
in
principle
,
functions
can
be
really
complicated
.
i
mean
,
all
the
examples
we
've
seen
are
just
doing
various
kinds
of
algebra
.
i
mean
,
maybe
different
algebra
,
depending
upon
which
value
of
x
i
'm
plugging
in
.
but
it
's
all
,
you
know
,
adding
,
subtracting
,
multiplying
,
dividing
that
sort
of
thing
.
but
you
can
do
really
complicated
things
with
,
with
functions
.
let
's
see
an
example
of
something
that
is
you
know
really
different
than
doing
straight
up
algebra
.
i
'll
do
a
much
crazier
example
.
alright
.
c
(
x
)
is
the
number
of
even
digits
in
the
number
x
,
when
x
is
a
whole
number
.
it
is
zero
if
x
is
n't
a
whole
number
,
so
otherwise
.
and
it
is
a
really
different
and
crazy
function
,
right
?
so
,
c
of
,
say
,
7236
is
two
,
and
why
is
that
?
this
is
a
whole
number
so
i
use
the
first
part
of
the
rule
.
and
the
number
of
even
digits
in
this
number
,
well
,
i
count
them
.
that
's
odd
,
even
,
odd
,
even
.
so
,
two
and
six
are
the
two
even
digits
.
the
value
of
that
function
is
two
.
well
,
let
's
take
a
look
at
this
number
here
,
60,202.
that
again
is
a
whole
number
,
so
the
value
of
the
function
at
60,202
is
the
number
of
even
digits
in
x.
and
this
number
has
how
many
even
digits
?
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
they
're
all
even
digits
so
that
value
is
five
.
here
's
another
example
.
here
's
another
5-digit
number
.
again
,
it
's
a
whole
number
so
i
use
the
first
part
of
the
rule
,
the
number
of
even
digits
.
i
count
how
many
of
these
digits
are
even
.
five
is
odd
,
odd
,
odd
,
odd
,
odd
.
there
are
no
even
digits
.
so
,
the
value
of
this
function
is
zero
at
this
point
.
now
,
if
i
plug
in
a
number
that
's
not
a
whole
number
like
this
,
this
is
not
a
whole
number
,
then
i
use
the
otherwise
part
of
the
definition
.
and
the
function
at
that
point
is
just
a
zero
.
so
,
we
can
use
english
to
define
a
function
but
you
got
to
be
careful
,
alright
?
sometimes
,
when
you
write
another
definition
of
a
function
,
you
might
write
down
something
that
's
more
ambiguous
than
,
than
you
intended
.
so
,
let
's
try
to
define
a
function
.
just
making
this
stuff
up
,
i
'll
call
the
function
b
(
x
)
for
bad
.
and
i
'll
say
that
the
value
of
b
(
x
)
is
some
rearrangement
of
the
digits
of
x.
and
it
's
okay
that
i
'm
using
english
to
define
my
functions
.
there
's
nothing
wrong
with
that
.
but
this
definition
is
too
ambiguous
to
be
the
definition
of
a
function
.
here
's
a
definition
of
what
goes
wrong
.
what
is
the
function
's
value
at
352
?
well
,
the
function
takes
its
input
and
rearranges
the
digits
somehow
,
alright
?
so
,
you
might
think
that
the
functions
value
at
352
is
325.
because
325
is
some
rearrangement
of
the
digits
of
352
,
right
,
i
took
the
five
and
the
two
,
swapped
their
positions
.
but
then
,
the
functions
value
at
352
should
also
be
235
because
235
is
also
a
rearrangement
of
352.
the
function
's
value
with
352
should
also
be
532
because
532
is
some
rearrangement
of
the
digits
of
352.
this
is
terrible
,
alright
?
a
function
is
suppose
to
take
its
input
and
produce
unambiguously
a
single
output
value
.
but
this
so-called
function
takes
this
single
input
value
and
purportedly
produces
all
these
possible
outputs
.
this
thing
here
is
not
a
function
,
alright
?
a
function
takes
one
input
and
produces
one
output
.
