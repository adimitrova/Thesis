music calculus study functions this 
course is exception 
going to studying functions in 
this course, alright 
functions like f x sine 
function square root function 
that raises a question 
functionsif if going to 
studying functions, we know 

that question is pretty metaphysical 
i mean numbers 
numbers 
i mean that question doesnt make a lot 
sense 
i, you know, like a number four 
is a physical object that i go look 
see if got polka dots 
striped something, 
right 
i know four objects i see them, 
right 
i sort understand numbers 
in metaphysical 
sense 
is true functions, 
right 
im really going to tell you a 
function is 
im going to tell you is a 
function 
this is a function 
a function assigns to number in 
domain another number 
this definition doesnt say anything 
function that 
assignment 
lets see an example 
make example 
suppose ive got function, ill call 
f, f function 
maybe this function assigns to number 
two, number four 
so, ill write f is f is 
f is f is 
im making this 
this is a function 
im telling you number 
assigns to number, 
right 
f assigns number two, number 
four 
f is , right 
so, f assigns to number three, 
number nine 
well, look, 
im going to list every 
single assignment that f makes 
so instead, one way to talk 
assignments is to use a rule, like fx 
x 
this single rule explains 
assignments made, 
alright 
this rule said that f assigns to 
number x, number x 
so in particular, f assigns number 
five, five squared , f assigns 
number four, four squared is 
sixteen f assigns number three, 
three squared is nine, alright 
so, a lot times, you actually 
want to talk assignments 
made, use sort rule 
like this you write f x is 
something, to compute output value, 
right 
so, a function assigns to number in 
domain another number 
one way to that is a rule 
course, this definition function 
involves another word, domain 
is a domain 
unless, i say otherwise, domain 
consists numbers 
rule makes sense, 
right 
a function assigns to number in 
domain another number 
domain is numbers that i 
plug in 
lets take a look to see i mean 
this 
suppose ive got a function fx x 
so, thats a function given a rule 
takes an input x produces 
output x, 
right 
assigns number x, number 
x 
this rule doesnt always make sense, 
right 
im dividing x, 
alright 
to divide x, i need 
well, 
i must that x is zero, 
permitted to divide zero 
so, i plug in number x except 
zero 
thats this rule makes sense 
so, ill summarize that saying that 
domain f is real numbers 
except zero 
so, a function takes input 
produces output 
thats 
is that supposed to make us feel, 
you know 
we supposed to imagine that 
well, heres one metaphor that you could 
use to try to think a function 
is actually doing, right 
you could imagine a, a conveyor belt 
function, 
you know, 
you could imagine numbers coming 
in 
boom 
hit function going 
transformed somehow, whatever 
rule is function 
heres im talking 
ive got a conveyor belt here, i got this 
big box, imagine if that big box is 
function 
in here, ive got input, imagine 
number five 
lets see this machine is going to 

maybe this is function fx x x 
ive got this number five here 
ill start conveyer belt going so 
number five starts moving 
machine machine is done 
processing it, comes 
side now, number , 
alright 
f is , is 
is 
so, we seen you write a 
function using a, a rule involving 
these, mathematical symbols, 
right 
x x 
you also write a function 
using english words 
so, lets see an example that, 
make a new function here 
ill call rx ill define rx 
to thrice, that means three times, 
thrice square root x 
here, ive computed some, values 
function, you know, like 
function that four is six 
well, is that 
well, r would three times 
square root four, is three times 
two is six 
okay now, course, i 
calculation this way, you know, 
surprising that instead writing 
this in words, thrice square root 
x, 
i mean i could written three 
times square root x 
so, maybe youre impressed 
this 
point is that you define a 
function writing 
function is supposed to using english 
words 
so, weve seen an example a function 
that we defined in terms algebra, 
fx x x 
ive also seen an example a function 
that i define entirely english 
words 
we kind combine two things, 
alright 
we use english to sort pick 
different kinds algebra 
lets see an example that 
so, heres another function i made 

gx is x if x is bigger equal 
to five 
twice x if x is less five 
point here is that im using a 
little bit english 
so, this word, if, in order to select 
based big x is, 
a different algebraic rule 
calculating function this is a 
little abstract 
let calculations 
that might convince you, you know, how, 
this notation is, 
this socalled piecewise notation works 
so, is g 
well, lets take a look 
one is less five so that means i use 
this second rule calculating g, 
so two times one is two 
whats g of, say, four 
well, four is still less five so i 
use second rule 
twice input, two times four that 
means output is eight 
is, say, g 
ooh 
five is less five 
five is greater equal to five 
so, this if is telling to use 
first two rules calculating g 
so im going to use five squared 
output that will 
g 
well, ten is definitely bigger 
equal to five bigger five 
so, i use first rule 
output to this function is computed 
ten squared 
so, this is, you know, really 
complicated using algebra, 
right 
im using if statements to select 
two rules g will use to 
compute output 
in principle, functions really 
complicated 
i mean, examples weve seen 
various kinds algebra 
i mean, maybe different algebra, 
depending upon value x im 
plugging in 
all, you know, adding, 
subtracting, multiplying, dividing that 
sort thing 
you really complicated things 
with, functions 
lets see an example something that is 
you know really different 
straight algebra 
ill a much crazier example 
alright 
cx is number even digits in 
number x, x is a whole number 
is zero if x isnt a whole number, so 
otherwise 
is a really different crazy 
function, right 
so, c of, say, is two, is 
that 
this is a whole number so i use first 
part rule 
number even digits in this 
number, 
well, i count 
thats odd, 
even, 
odd, 
even 
so, two six two even digits 
value that function is two 
well, lets take a look this number 
here, , 
that is a whole number, so 
value function , is 
number even digits in x 
this number many even digits 
one, two, three, four, five, theyre 
even digits so that value is five 
heres another example 
heres another digit number 
again, a whole number so i use 
first part rule, number 
even digits 
i count many digits 
even 
five is odd, odd, odd, odd, odd 
there even digits 
so, value this function is zero 
this point 
now, if i plug in a number thats a 
whole number like this, this is a 
whole number, i use otherwise 
part definition 
function that point is a 
zero 
so, we use english to define a 
function you got to careful, 
alright sometimes, you write 
another definition a function, you 
might write something thats 
ambiguous than, you intended 
so, lets try to define a function 
making this stuff up, ill call 
function bx bad 
ill say that value bx is 
rearrangement digits x 
okay that im using english to 
define functions 
theres nothing wrong that 
this definition is ambiguous to 
definition a function 
heres a definition goes wrong 
is functions value 
well, function takes input 
rearranges digits somehow, alright 
so, you might think that functions 
value is 
is rearrangement 
digits , right, i took five 
two, swapped positions 
then, functions value 
also is also a 
rearrangement 
functions value also 
is rearrangement 
digits 
this is terrible, 
alright 
a function is suppose to take input 
produce unambiguously a single output 
value 
this socalled function takes this 
single input value purportedly 
produces possible outputs 
this thing here is a function, 
alright 
a function takes one input produces 
one output
