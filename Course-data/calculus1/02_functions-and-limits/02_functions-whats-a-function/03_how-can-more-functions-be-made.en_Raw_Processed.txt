functions going to main star 
course 
so we building in sort a 
repertoire library functions that 
we might interested in studying 
heres first function in library 
fx x, 
identity function 
whatever you plug in, this function 
outputs that thing 
heres another function, 
a constant function 
you pick number c, 
c stands constant 
alright 
you define this function, 
fx c 
whatever you plugin x, f ignores 
that outputs original value, 
c 
heres a function, fx x 
if youre thinking stuff like 
that, stuff like this pick two 
numbers, a b, you define 
a function like this, fx ax b 
you think fifth fx x 
nth power, fx xn fixed 
value n 
polynomials, like this 
complicated looking polynomial, fx 
x x x 
if youre thinking polynomials, you 
might want to think roots, 
fx equals, say square root x 
you might remember absolute value 
function fx equals absolute value 
x 
you might experience trig 
functions, 
like sines, cosines, tangents, 
transcendental functions 
like logarithms exponentials 
so weve got small library 
functions, 
identity function, constant 
functions, polynomials, trig 
functions, 
i want functions 
i, i want way to able to take two 
functions produce a new function 

okay 
so in this setup ive got a conveyor belt 
ive got two functions, 
a function here a function here 
lets pick functions 

maybe first function ill call f 
fx would x 
so ill call this function f maybe 
second function ill call g g 
will take input square it, so 
gx will x 
so ill label this function, g 
here, ive got a number i 
going to run that number 
first function whatever comes 
first function, im going to plug in 
to second function to see comes 

so lets take that number , lets start 
moving conveyor belt 
going to go function f, 
f is to , is 
so weve got a right there 
so went function came 
a 
im going to take output to f 
put in to input g 
so g, well going to 
thatll 
so here now, coming function 
g, is number 
i could written this in a little 
bit a little bit a shorthand way 
i could written gf, 
right, f is g is 
so ive got this sort conveyor 
belt metaphor going in head, i 
could following trick 
i take two functions 
i take output to first 
function plug in to input 
second function
