sound so, knows a function is, 
right 
i know 
takes an input value, produces an 
output value 
weve got a whole bunch functions, 
right 
we take functions start 
asking questions 
happens you plug in a really 
big number, a really small number 
or, happens you plug in two 
numbers that nearby 
outputs related, right 
kinds questions that 
going to occupy us rest 
term 
even we start thinking 
questions like that, right there 
things that we still ask 
functions 
like, you know two functions 
function 
instance, heres two functions 
fx x, gx x x 
function 
now, lets try 
look value like f 
f , start replacing x 
two, 
well, whats whats g 
well, g would 
, , 
look, f g, i plug in x give 
output value nine 
that a little bit 
surprising, right 
way that f g telling 
to compute output is totally 
different 
f takes input two, adds one to 
squares to get nine 
g takes two, squares it, doubles it, adds 
two numbers to one, to get nine 
so, method f g 
calculations is totally different, 
right 
this sequence operations is 
this sequence operations 
the, rules different 
yet, look this 
fx, value x, right is x 
x, 
right thats x 
well, i could expand this out, right 
x, x x 
i could combine terms, 
right x x x 
x x x 
look, x x, thats gx 
this is really quite surprising 
f g dont compute output in 
way, right 
this one is something different 
this function, yet, 
input value, fs output value is this, 
is expanding 
gx 
now, going to deal this 
going to say that f g 
function, 
right 
rule, 
right 
every input value, 
output value 
heres a much subtle example 
again, i got two functions 
f is defined like this 
fx x x, 
g is defined like this, 
gx is x, identity function 
question, is f g 
function 
now, theyre rule, right 
this is this 
so, you know, a little subtle, 
you know 
thats okay, right 
two functions if 
output input 
so, lets see if that happens here 
lets pick value to get a first 
test 
lets take a look f, right 
f would , 
thats 
, thats 
well, thats g, right if 
i plug anything g, i get 
thing 
so, plug in five, you get five 
so, least value five, f g 
agree 
you might think this always works, 
right 
something like this 
you might want to say, well, fx thats 
x x, 
matter x is 
you might rewrite this x x x x 
then, youd tempted to say, cancel 
one xes x in 
denominator 
then, youd write equals x 
x, well thats, thats gx 
so, this looks like a pretty convincing 
argument, right 
here, ive got f x, 
ive got a bunch equal signs 
here, ive got gx 
so maybe that means f g 
function 
ha, so fast 
happens if you plug in zero 
whats f 
well, i know g is 
g is zero, right 
zero is in domain g zero 
makes sense this rule 
but, whats f 
well, that would zero squared 
zero, 
whoa 
okay 
you see this is terrible, 
right 
i cannot divide zero 
this rule, x x doesnt make sense 
x is equal to zero 
so, zero is in domain f, 
is in domain g 
so, im going to say that 
function 
dont domain, 
right 
f isnt defined zero, 
g is defined zero 
in that sense, really different 
functions 
this example suggests that theres a real 
richness to this theory functions, 
right 
going to studying a lot 
this term
