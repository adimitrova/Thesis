1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:05,652
[MUSIC] So, before we talk about the 
domain of the square root function, we 

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:10,316
just want to remind ourselves what the 
square root function even is. 

3
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:14,131
So here, I've made a graph of the square 
root function. 

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:19,926
And along the x-axis, I plot the numbers 
one to sixteen and in the y-axis I've got 

5
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:24,730
the numbers one through four. 
And then in this green curve here, I've 

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,840
plotted the the, the square root 
function. 

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,316
What is the square root, right? 
Well, here's an example. 

8
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:36,563
Here, I've got the square root of four. 
And I'm saying the square root of four is 

9
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,448
two. 
What that means, is if I take the number 

10
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:44,402
two and I square it, I get back four. 
I don't know, if I move over to, say, the 

11
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:49,255
square root of nine, I get three. 
And that's because three squared is nine, 

12
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:52,379
alright, 
or if I move over a little bit further, 

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,032
the square root of sixteen is four. 
And that's because four squared is 

14
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:00,156
sixteen. 
I know there's some crazier values, too. 

15
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:03,414
If I move over here to the square root of 
two, 

16
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:08,532
well, the square root of two is this sort 
of crazy number 1.414213 blah, blah, 

17
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:11,457
blah. 
And maybe it's a little bit surprising, 

18
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:15,800
that if I take that number and square it, 
I get back two. 

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,167
So, what's going on here, alright? 
The square root function takes a number 

20
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:24,958
and spits out a new number, that new 
number when you multiply it by itself and 

21
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,870
you square it, you get back your original 
number. 

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,456
Now, here's the question, what sorts of 
numbers can I take the square root of? 

23
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:36,862
That's asking the question, what's the 
domain of the square root function? 

24
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:41,811
Now, that we've seen the graph, let's try 
to write down in words a definition of 

25
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,790
the square root function. 
So, in light of what we just seen, you 

26
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:51,265
might think that the definition of the 
function f(x) equals square root of x is 

27
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:55,472
a number which squares to x. 
There's a problem with this though. 

28
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:59,211
Take a look at say, f(9). 
What would f(9) be? 

29
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:04,619
Well, if you're thinking the square root 
of x is a number which squares to x, then 

30
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,625
you might think that f(9) would be -3, 
alright? 

31
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:16,597
Because -3^2 is 9. 
But then, you might also think that half 

32
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:23,820
of nine should be three, right? 
Because 3^2 is also 9. 

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,933
This is bad, alright? 
A function is supposed to be unambiguous. 

34
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,460
It's supposed to have one output for each 
input. 

35
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,479
If you take this as the definition of the 
square root function, just any number 

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,482
which squares to x, you've introduced 
some ambiguity, alright? 

37
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:45,120
What's the square root of nine? 
Is it -3 or is it +3? 

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,441
Both of those numbers square to nine. 
So, this is, this is bad, alright? 

39
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:54,651
The solution is to change the definition. 
Instead of having the the square root 

40
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:59,290
function be just a number which squares 
to x, you're going to take it to be the 

41
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,672
nonnegative number which squares to x. 
This is better, alright? 

42
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:13,222
In our example here, if I only am allowed 
to choose the nonnegative number, which 

43
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:21,147
squares to x, then f(9) equals -3, well, 
-3 is not nonnegative, -3 is negative. 

44
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:25,029
So, that means that this isn't the case, 
right? 

45
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:32,226
All I'm left with is f(9) = 3, right? 
Three is the nonnegative number which 

46
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,112
squares to nine. 
Alright. 

47
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:39,949
So, this will be our definition for for, 
for the square root function. 

48
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:44,860
The square root of x is the nonnegative 
number which squares to x. 

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,410
There's one particular place where this 
plays out and it's extraordinarily 

50
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,020
important. 
So, let's take a look at that now. 

51
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,261
We've got our definition. 
The squared of x is the nonnegative 

52
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:01,372
number which squares to x. 
Now, there's one popular misconception 

53
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:06,910
that comes up because of this definition. 
So, in light of the definition of the 

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,999
square root, right, 
the square root of a number being the 

55
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,025
nonnegative number which squares the 
number to the radical, you might be 

56
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,390
tricked into thinking that the square 
root of x squared is x. 

57
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,734
That's not true and let's see why. 
Let's do a specific example where say, x 

58
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:28,240
is -4. 
So, if I replace the x's here by -4, the 

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,225
left hand side is the square root of -4 
squared, 

60
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:34,770
right? 
Square root of x squared but with x 

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,890
replaced with -4. 
Now, - 4 * -4 is 16. 

62
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,980
This is the square root of 16 and the 
square root of sixteen, the definition of 

63
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,100
the square root is the nonnegative number 
which squares to 16. 

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,220
There's two numbers that square to 16, +4 
and -4. 

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,250
But the square root is by convention, the 
nonnegative one, so this is equal to 4. 

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,410
Duh, 
look at what happened. 

67
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,893
-4, square root of -4^2 + 4, 
that's the x over here. 

68
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:11,129
This is not true, right. 
You should not be tricked into thinking 

69
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,451
that that's the case. 
Instead, something else is true, 

70
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,695
right? 
What is true is this. 

71
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,350
The square root of x squared is the 
absolute value of x. 

72
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,697
And that works in this specific case, 
right? 

73
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:33,781
When x is -4, the square root of -4 
squared, the square root of 16 is 4. 

74
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:40,924
And 4 really is the absolute value of -4. 
Alright. So, this is a mistake that comes 

75
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,143
up quite a bit. 
People are often tricked into thinking 

76
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,765
that the square root of x squared is just 
x, 

77
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:50,998
alright? They're just trying to cancel 
the square roots in the squaring. 

78
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:54,574
That's not possible. 
Instead, what is true is the square root 

79
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:59,343
of x^2 is the absolute value of x. 
So, we've got a definition of the square 

80
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:03,932
root function and we've seen that the 
square root of x^2 is not just x, 

81
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:05,900
it's the absolute value of x. 
Now, 

82
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,124
that doesn't actually address the 
original question, right? 

83
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:13,128
The original question is, what's the 
domain of this square root function? 

84
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:17,631
What sorts of numbers can I take root of? 
For instance, can I take the square root 

85
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,800
of a negative number? 
Let's see why not. 

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,266
Very concretely. 
Does it make sense, say, to talk about 

87
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,995
the square root of -16? 
Well, if it did that would be some 

88
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,873
number. 
So, I'll call that number k for crazy, 

89
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:33,078
alright? 
And what do I know about that number k? 

90
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:37,657
Well, k^22 would have to be -16. 
Remember, the definition of the square 

91
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:41,189
root function? 
It's a number that I square to get back 

92
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:45,245
the original number. 
So, if there were a square root of -16, 

93
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:50,341
when I square it, I get back -16. 
And imagining here that k is some real 

94
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,872
number. 
And that means there's three 

95
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:56,386
possibilities. 
Either k is positive, k is zero, or k is 

96
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:59,831
negative. 
If k is positive, then k squared would 

97
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:05,173
also be positive because a positive 
number times a positive number is still 

98
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:08,477
positive. 
But that can't be, because k squared is 

99
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:12,905
supposed to be -16. 
So, this first possibility doesn't 

100
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:16,209
happen. 
Now, if k were zero, then k squared would 

101
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,935
be zero, but k squared is supposed to be 
-16. 

102
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:22,230
So, k isn't zero. 
Is k negative? 

103
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,108
Well then, what's k squared? 
That would be a negative number times a 

104
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,223
negative number, and that would still be 
positive. 

105
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:33,546
And that can't be because k squared is 
supposed to be -16. 

106
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:38,128
So, this possibility also doesn't happen. 
So, all of our possibilities have been 

107
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,704
eliminated, 
alright? There can't be a real number k, 

108
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:44,888
which is the square root of -16. 
Because if k were positive, k squared 

109
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:47,571
would be positive but k squared has to be 
negative. 

110
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:51,541
k can't be zero because then k squared 
isn't negative and k can't be negative 

111
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,511
because then k squared is positive but k 
squared is supposed to be negative, 

112
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:59,589
alright? The upshot is that it just 
doesn't make any sense to talk about the 

113
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,753
square root of a negative number. 
In contrast, it does make sense to talk 

114
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:07,911
about the square root of zero, which is 
just zero, 

115
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:11,971
zero squared is zero. 
And it also makes sense to talk about the 

116
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:16,418
square root of positive numbers. 
So, to summarize the situation, we can 

117
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:21,574
say that the domain of the square root 
function is all the numbers between zero 

118
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:25,440
and infinity, including zero. 
So, I'm using the square bracket. 

119
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,630
But, of course, not including infinity 
because infinity is not a number. 

120
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,706
Sometimes, you're asked to calculate the 
domain of a function that's more 

121
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,912
complicated than, than just the square 
root of x. 

122
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,052
Let's see an example of that. 
So, let's try this. 

123
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:46,396
Let's try to find the domain of this 
function g, which is the square root of 

124
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:49,869
2x + 4. 
And remember, the domain consists of all 

125
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,674
the inputs for which the rule makes 
sense. 

126
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:56,950
So, I just have to think which x values 
makes sense for this rule? 

127
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,253
Well, in order to take the square root of 
2x + 4, I'm going to need that 2x + four 

128
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:07,363
is not negative because I can't take the 
square root of a negative number so I 

129
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:12,407
need to guarantee that 2x + 4 is not 
negative, meaning greater than or equal 

130
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,512
to zero. 
Now, I can subtract four from both sides 

131
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:20,492
and I get that 2x is at least -4. 
Then, I can divide both sides by two. 

132
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,855
Two is positive, so it doesn't change the 
inequality. 

133
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:29,705
x is bigger than or equal to -2. 
So, as long as x is at least -2, then 2x 

134
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:36,286
+ 4 is at least zero, which means it 
makes sense to take the square root. 

135
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:40,790
So, I can summarize the situation, the 
domain of g consists of all numbers 

136
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,987
greater than or equal to -2. 
This is our notation for that. 

137
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:50,348
I used a square bracket to include the -2 
and the round bracket here on the 

138
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:54,740
infinity, because infinity is not number, 
it's not part of the domain. 

139
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,014
So, that example was a little bit harder. 
Let's do an even harder example where 

140
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:03,123
I've got multiple square roots, all 
right, the square root of something plus 

141
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:06,904
the square root of something. 
And let's figure out the domain of this 

142
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:09,315
function that has two separate square 
roots. 

143
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:14,082
This is the function T(x) equals the 
square root of 1 - x plus the square root 

144
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,720
of 1 + x. 
Now, in order for this rule to make 

145
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,729
sense, I have to be able to take this 
square root and also take this square 

146
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,187
root. 
In other words, in order to do this first 

147
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:27,250
square root, I'm going to need that 1 - x 
is bigger than or equal to zero, 

148
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,021
alright? 
I need the thing under the square root to 

149
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,516
be nonnegative in order to do a square 
root. 

150
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:37,117
In order to take this square root, I need 
1 + x to be bigger than or equal to zero. 

151
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:41,496
And both of these things have to be true 
in order to take both of these square 

152
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:45,700
roots and then add them together. 
So, I'll put an and between them. 

153
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,109
Now, I go to x to both sides and this 
inequality and I get one is bigger than 

154
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:53,826
or equal to x. 
And I can subtract one from both sides of 

155
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,850
this and I'll get x is bigger or equal to 
-1. 

156
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,126
And again, both of these things have to 
happen, right? 

157
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:05,733
I need x less than one and x bigger than 
or equal to -1 in order to evaluate this 

158
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,697
function. 
Let me write this in in a more reasonable 

159
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:09,230
way, 
right? 

160
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,907
Instead of writing one bigger than or 
equal to x, I can write what I just said, 

161
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:16,011
x less than one. 
And here, I'll write, this is x bigger 

162
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:20,315
than or equal to -1. 
Now, I could write these inequalities as 

163
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:25,347
something about an interval. 
I could say that x is in the interval -1 

164
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:26,208
to 1, 
alright? 

165
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:32,035
To say that x is less than one and bigger 
than or equal to -1, exactly means that 

166
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:36,074
your inside this interval. 
And I'm using square brackets here, 

167
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:40,444
because I've got greater than or equal 
to, less than or equal to. 

168
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:45,344
And then, I can summarize the situation 
by writing the domain of T is this 

169
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:45,344
interval, 
alright? 

170
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:51,295
And this is describing the values of x 
for which this rule makes sense at the 

171
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,985
domain of the function T. 
Let's do one more example. 

172
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:59,545
some square root problem where I've also 
got an x squared term. 

173
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:02,873
Let's calculate the domain of this 
function C. 

174
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:09,959
C of x is the square root of 1 - x^2. 
So, the domain consists of all the inputs 

175
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,734
for which the rule makes sense. 
So, I'm looking for which values of x 

176
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,246
make the thing under the square root 
nonnegative. 

177
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:23,794
There's lots of different ways to think 
about which values of x make this true. 

178
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:31,659
one way is to factor 1 - x^2. 
So, I could factor 1 - x^2 as 1 + x * 1 - 

179
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,960
x, alright? 
That is equal to 1 - x^2. 

180
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,831
I'm looking for when that's nonnegative. 
This is a little bit easier to think 

181
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:44,029
about because now, I just got to figure 
out when these two terms have the same 

182
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:44,728
sign, 
alright? 

183
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:48,711
When they're both positive or they're 
both negative, then their product is 

184
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,510
bigger than or equal to zero. 
So, to think about that, 

185
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:59,223
I'll draw a number line. 
And I'll first think about when 1 + x is 

186
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:04,937
positive and negative. 
So, something special happens at -1, 

187
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:09,794
alright? 
When x is minus one, 1 + x is zero. 

188
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:14,841
When x is less than -1, 1 + x is 
negative. 

189
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:20,460
And when x is bigger than -1, 1 plus x is 
positive. 

190
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:30,785
Alright. Now, compare this with 1 - x, 
alright? 1 - x, something exciting 

191
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:38,060
happens at one, alright When X is less 
then one, 1 - x is positive. 

192
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,643
And when x is bigger than one, 1 - x is 
negative. 

193
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:52,648
Now, I'm not trying really to understand 
1 + x or 1 - x, I'm trying to understand 

194
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,651
their product. 
So, when I multiply those two together, I 

195
00:13:56,651 --> 00:14:03,580
get 1 - x^2 and I want to know, you know, 
when is that positive or or negative. 

196
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,503
Let me mark down the special points -1 
and 1. 

197
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:15,337
And now, 1 - x^2 is the product of these 
so I can think about various values of x. 

198
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:22,099
So, when x is less than -1, then 1 + x is 
negative and 1 - x is positive, and a 

199
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:25,801
negative number times a positive number 
is negative. 

200
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:33,061
When x is between -1 and 1, then 1 + x is 
positive and 1 - x is also positive in 

201
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:35,980
that region, so their product is 
positive. 

202
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,803
And when x is bigger than one, 1 + x is 
positive and 1 - x is negative, so their 

203
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:45,621
product is negative. 
Now, this gets me most of the way there, 

204
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:48,792
alright? 
Because what I'm trying to understand is 

205
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:53,645
when this product is nonnegative and I 
can see that it's positive in this 

206
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:58,562
region, I could also think about what 
happens when I plug in -1 and 1. 

207
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:02,380
When I plug in -1, I get 1 - 1 which is 
zero. 

208
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,068
And when I plug in one, I get 1 - 1 which 
is zero. 

209
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:12,126
So, the function is, in fact, is zero in 
between here at -1 and 1. 

210
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:18,850
So, I'm just trying to figure out which 
values of x make 1 - x^2 nonnegative. 

211
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,197
Well, -1, 1, and anything in between. 
So, one way to summarize the situation is 

212
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:31,770
to say that the domain of my function C 
consists of all real numbers between -1 

213
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,581
and 1, including -1 and 1. 
So, I'm using the square brackets. 

214
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:46,863
As long as x is inside here, 
then 1 - x^2 is nonnegative. 

215
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:56,394
That means it makes sense to take the 
square root and that's the domain of C. 

216
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:56,394
