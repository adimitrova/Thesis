music so, we talk 
domain square root function, we 
want to remind 
square root function even is 
so here, ive made a graph square 
root function 
along xaxis, i plot numbers 
one to sixteen in yaxis ive got 
numbers one four 
in this green curve here, ive 
plotted the, square root 
function 
is square root, right 
well, heres an example 
here, ive got square root four 
im saying square root four is 
two 
that means, is if i take number 
two i square it, i get back four 
i dont know, if i move to, say, 
square root nine, i get three 
thats three squared is nine, 
alright, 
if i move a little bit further, 
square root sixteen is four 
thats four squared is 
sixteen 
i know theres crazier values, 
if i move here to square root 
two, 
well, square root two is this sort 
crazy number blah, blah, 
blah 
maybe a little bit surprising, 
that if i take that number square it, 
i get back two 
so, whats going here, alright 
square root function takes a number 
spits a new number, that new 
number you multiply 
you square it, you get back original 
number 
now, heres question, sorts 
numbers i take square root 
thats asking question, whats 
domain square root function 
now, that weve seen graph, lets try 
to write in words a definition 
square root function 
so, in light we seen, you 
might think that definition 
function fx equals square root x is 
a number squares to x 
theres a problem this though 
take a look say, f 
would f 
well, if youre thinking square root 
x is a number squares to x, 
you might think that f would , 
alright 
is 
then, you might also think that half 
nine three, right 
is also 
this is bad, alright 
a function is supposed to unambiguous 
supposed to one output 
input 
if you take this definition 
square root function, number 
squares to x, youve introduced 
ambiguity, alright 
whats square root nine 
is is 
numbers square to nine 
so, this is, this is bad, alright 
solution is to change definition 
instead square root 
function a number squares 
to x, youre going to take to 
nonnegative number squares to x 
this is better, alright 
in example here, if i allowed 
to choose nonnegative number, 
squares to x, f equals , well, 
is nonnegative, is negative 
so, that means that this isnt case, 
right 
im left is f , right 
three is nonnegative number 
squares to nine 
alright 
so, this will definition for, 
square root function 
square root x is nonnegative 
number squares to x 
theres one particular place this 
plays extraordinarily 
important 
so, lets take a look that 
weve got definition 
squared x is nonnegative 
number squares to x 
now, theres one popular misconception 
that comes this definition 
so, in light definition 
square root, right, 
square root a number 
nonnegative number squares 
number to radical, you might 
tricked thinking that square 
root x squared is x 
thats true lets see 
lets a specific example say, x 
is 
so, if i replace xs here , 
left hand side is square root 
squared, 
right 
square root x squared x 
replaced 
now, is 
this is square root 
square root sixteen, definition 
square root is nonnegative number 
squares to 
theres two numbers that square to , 

square root is convention, 
nonnegative one, so this is equal to 
duh, 
look happened 
, square root , 
thats x here 
this is true, right 
you tricked thinking 
that thats case 
instead, something else is true, 
right 
is true is this 
square root x squared is 
absolute value x 
that works in this specific case, 
right 
x is , square root 
squared, square root is 
really is absolute value 
alright so, this is a mistake that comes 
quite a bit 
people often tricked thinking 
that square root x squared is 
x, 
alright theyre trying to cancel 
square roots in squaring 
thats possible 
instead, is true is square root 
x is absolute value x 
so, weve got a definition square 
root function weve seen that 
square root x is x, 
absolute value x 
now, 
that doesnt actually address 
original question, right 
original question is, whats 
domain this square root function 
sorts numbers i take root 
instance, i take square root 
a negative number 
lets see 
concretely 
make sense, say, to talk 
square root 
well, if that would 
number 
so, ill call that number k crazy, 
alright 
i know that number k 
well, k would to 
remember, definition square 
root function 
a number that i square to get back 
original number 
so, if there a square root , 
i square it, i get back 
imagining here that k is real 
number 
that means theres three 
possibilities 
either k is positive, k is zero, k is 
negative 
if k is positive, k squared would 
also positive a positive 
number times a positive number is still 
positive 
that cant be, k squared is 
supposed to 
so, this first possibility doesnt 
happen 
now, if k zero, k squared would 
zero, k squared is supposed to 
so, k isnt zero 
is k negative 
well then, whats k squared 
that would a negative number times a 
negative number, that would still 
positive 
that cant k squared is 
supposed to 
so, this possibility also doesnt happen 
so, possibilities 
eliminated, 
alright there cant a real number k, 
is square root 
if k positive, k squared 
would positive k squared to 
negative 
k cant zero k squared 
isnt negative k cant negative 
k squared is positive k 
squared is supposed to negative, 
alright upshot is that 
doesnt make sense to talk 
square root a negative number 
in contrast, make sense to talk 
square root zero, is 
zero, 
zero squared is zero 
also makes sense to talk 
square root positive numbers 
so, to summarize situation, we 
say that domain square root 
function is numbers between zero 
infinity, including zero 
so, im using square bracket 
but, course, including infinity 
infinity is a number 
sometimes, youre asked to calculate 
domain a function thats 
complicated than, square 
root x 
lets see an example that 
so, lets try this 
lets try to find domain this 
function g, is square root 
x 
remember, domain consists 
inputs rule makes 
sense 
so, i to think x values 
makes sense this rule 
well, in order to take square root 
x , im going to need that x four 
is negative i cant take 
square root a negative number so i 
need to guarantee that x is 
negative, meaning greater equal 
to zero 
now, i subtract four sides 
i get that x is least 
then, i divide sides two 
two is positive, so doesnt change 
inequality 
x is bigger equal to 
so, long x is least , x 
is least zero, means 
makes sense to take square root 
so, i summarize situation, 
domain g consists numbers 
greater equal to 
this is notation that 
i used a square bracket to include 
round bracket here 
infinity, infinity is number, 
part domain 
so, that example a little bit harder 
lets an even harder example 
ive got multiple square roots, 
right, square root something plus 
square root something 
lets figure domain this 
function that two separate square 
roots 
this is function tx equals 
square root x plus square root 
x 
now, in order this rule to make 
sense, i to able to take this 
square root also take this square 
root 
in words, in order to this first 
square root, im going to need that x 
is bigger equal to zero, 
alright 
i need thing square root to 
nonnegative in order to a square 
root 
in order to take this square root, i need 
x to bigger equal to zero 
things to true 
in order to take square 
roots add together 
so, ill put an between 
now, i go to x to sides this 
inequality i get one is bigger 
equal to x 
i subtract one sides 
this ill get x is bigger equal to 
again, things to 
happen, right 
i need x less one x bigger 
equal to in order to evaluate this 
function 
let write this in in a reasonable 
way, 
right 
instead writing one bigger 
equal to x, i write i said, 
x less one 
here, ill write, this is x bigger 
equal to 
now, i could write inequalities 
something an interval 
i could say that x is in interval 
to , 
alright 
to say that x is less one bigger 
equal to , exactly means that 
inside this interval 
im using square brackets here, 
ive got greater equal 
to, less equal to 
then, i summarize situation 
writing domain is this 
interval, 
alright 
this is describing values x 
this rule makes sense 
domain function 
lets one example 
square root problem ive also 
got an x squared term 
lets calculate domain this 
function c 
c x is square root x 
so, domain consists inputs 
rule makes sense 
so, im looking values x 
make thing square root 
nonnegative 
theres lots different ways to think 
values x make this true 
one way is to factor x 
so, i could factor x x 
x, alright 
that is equal to x 
im looking thats nonnegative 
this is a little bit easier to think 
now, i got to figure 
two terms 
sign, 
alright 
theyre positive theyre 
negative, product is 
bigger equal to zero 
so, to think that, 
ill draw a number line 
ill first think x is 
positive negative 
so, something special happens , 
alright 
x is minus one, x is zero 
x is less , x is 
negative 
x is bigger , plus x is 
positive 
alright now, compare this x, 
alright x, something exciting 
happens one, alright x is less 
one, x is positive 
x is bigger one, x is 
negative 
now, im trying really to understand 
x x, im trying to understand 
product 
so, i multiply two together, i 
get x i want to know, you know, 
is that positive negative 
let mark special points 

now, x is product 
so i think various values x 
so, x is less , x is 
negative x is positive, a 
negative number times a positive number 
is negative 
x is between , x is 
positive x is also positive in 
that region, so product is 
positive 
x is bigger one, x is 
positive x is negative, so 
product is negative 
now, this gets way there, 
alright 
im trying to understand is 
this product is nonnegative i 
see that positive in this 
region, i could also think 
happens i plug in 
i plug in , i get is 
zero 
i plug in one, i get 
is zero 
so, function is, in fact, is zero in 
between here 
so, im trying to figure 
values x make x nonnegative 
well, , , anything in between 
so, one way to summarize situation is 
to say that domain function c 
consists real numbers between 
, including 
so, im using square brackets 
long x is inside here, 
x is nonnegative 
that means makes sense to take 
square root thats domain c
