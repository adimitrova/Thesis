music so, theres different 
ways taking two functions 
producing new functions 
you could add, subtract, multiply, divide 
two functions, could take two 
functions compose them, meaning that 
output one becomes input 

in light to this, id encourage you 
to pick pen write 
extraordinarily complicated 
functions, 
alright 
function that you write 
probably never written in 
history humankind 
i mean, theres so many different 
choices that you could make you 
combining algebraic operations 
thats part makes calculus so 
amazing, 
right 
theres a huge variety functions 
there 
not, every function really 
source in combinations 
algebraic symbols, 
right 
a lot functions that we want to 
study really functions that 
somehow coming real world 
so, i want to see real world 
examples of, functions right 
so, heres one unit conversion 
celsius to fahrenheit 
two different temperature 
scales 
so, function would f x, 
x 
so, this is a linear function 
a number times x plus a number 
lets take a look whats f zero 
that would 
well, thats zero plus , that 
and, course, zero degrees celsius is 
thing degrees fahrenheit 
heres another example 
whats f of, say, 
well, thats nine 
is 
is , so is 
indeed, degrees celsius is 
thing degrees fahrenheit 
so, this function takes in something in 
celsius spits something in 
fahrenheit 
unit conversion is an example a 
function, hardly coolest example 
this is a much cooler example 
real world 
is this thing 
well, this thing here is a 
microcontroller 
so, a small computer 
attached to a couple light emitting 
diodes, leds 
a name like light emitting diode, 
you might think that light up, 
could 
in this circuit, im using light 
emitting diodes in reverse 
im using light sensors 
this one happens to a red one 
this one happens to a green one 
so, this circuit is let 
detect much red green light is 
falling sensors 
end is a usb cable 
plugs computer so i record 
results 
data that i gathered real 
world using microcontroller 
really two different functions 
a function red led a function 
green led 
along xaxis, ive plotted number 
seconds that elapsed since june 
th, pm 
yaxis, im plotting 
number clock cycles took to 
discharge led 
so, is red function 
input is a number a number 
seconds that elapsed since this 
particular moment in time 
output is many clock cycles 
takes that particular moment in time 
to discharge red led 
now, this thing sitting in 
windowsill, right 
sun rising 
sun rises, theres light 
shining sensors means fewer 
clock cycles necessary to discharge 
led 
you see that in this graph, 
right 
red function is decreasing sun 
rises 
theres tons examples functions 
coming real world 
heres one, human population 
a function 
input is a year, output is 
number people alive that year 
if you want to see this function 
take a look wikipedia 
article population growth theres a 
graph that function, along xaxis 
is years along yaxis is human 
population 
long researching internet, 
heres another example a real world 
function 
a function ill call f n, 
itll defined rule f n 
equals number google hits we 
search number n 
lets try 
lets figure values this 
function like f 
so i plug google, i find 
that theres billion hits 
so, function is a 
billion, alright, input is 
output this function is number 
google hits 
lets try , thats 
if i search that, theres million 
hits, 
alright 
so, f, function, is 
million 
if persistent, we plug inn lots 
numbers, make a really 
nicelooking chart like this 
now, you this hundreds numbers, 
right 
you type google, you see 
many google hits you get 
you plot them, right 
a function so you graph 
function 
along xaxis is number that i 
typed google yaxis is 
millions google hits that i get 
you look graph this 
function, random 
theres real structure here, right 
function is decreasing, right 
larger values get smaller outputs 
because, you know, there is fewer 
webpages that talk really large 
numbers popular small numbers 
even dramatically, you plot 
this this special log, log graph 
paper, graph looks like sitting 
near a straight line 
i mean, thats, thats really amazing 
you think 
i mean, this is sort pattern 
thats hidden in number pages 
that talk numbers 
i mean 
is this coming from, right 
a function real world 
input is a number 
output is a number 
we want to understand that function 
calculus is part tool kit 
analyzing problems like this 
so, weve seen functions 
take input transform 
in output 
weve even sort got this mental 
image now, 
this metaphor a machine 
a conveyor belt thats transforming 
input output 
weve seen to build a lot new 
functions using algebra 
say, composing two functions 
weve thought real world 
examples 
music now, going to thinking 
functions rest 
term 
if youve got questions right now, i 
encourage you to contact soon 
possible 
i encourage you to get started 
homework right away 
good luck
