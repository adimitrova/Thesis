1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
[MUSIC] So, there's all these different 
ways of taking two functions and 

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,250
producing new functions. 
You could add, subtract, multiply, divide 

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,712
two functions, and could take two 
functions and compose them, meaning that 

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,073
the output for the one becomes the input 
for the other. 

5
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:20,962
In light to this, I'd encourage you just 
to pick up your pen and just write down 

6
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:22,979
some extraordinarily complicated 
functions, 

7
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,851
alright? 
The function that you write down has 

8
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:29,580
probably never been written down in the 
history of humankind. 

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,710
I mean, there's just so many different 
choices that you could make when you are 

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,951
combining all the algebraic operations. 
And that's part of what makes Calculus so 

11
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:38,684
amazing, 
right? 

12
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:41,357
There's just a huge variety of functions 
out there. 

13
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:45,183
But not, not every function really has 
its source in just combinations of 

14
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,441
algebraic symbols, 
right? 

15
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:50,266
A lot of the functions that we want to 
study are really functions that are 

16
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,725
somehow coming from the real world. 
So, I want to see some real world 

17
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,862
examples of, of functions right now. 
So, here's one unit conversion from 

18
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:03,474
Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
These are two different temperature 

19
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:06,574
scales. 
So, the function would be f of x, 

20
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:12,140
it's 9 * x / 5 + 32. 
So, this is just a linear function. 

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,023
It's a number times x plus a number. 
let's take a look what's f of zero. 

22
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:24,934
And that would be 9 * 0 / 5 + 32. 
Well, that's zero plus 32, that just 32 

23
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:31,286
and, of course, zero degrees Celsius is 
the same thing as 32 degrees Fahrenheit. 

24
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:35,673
Here's another example. 
What's f of, say, 37? 

25
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:46,653
Well, that's nine * 37 / 5 + 32. 
9 * 37 is 333 / 5 + 32. 

26
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:57,633
333 / 5 is 66.6, so 66.6 + 32 is 98.6. 
And indeed, 37 degrees Celsius is the 

27
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:06,906
same thing as 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
So, this function takes in something in 

28
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:11,080
Celsius and spits out something in 
Fahrenheit. 

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,622
Unit conversion is an example of a 
function, but hardly the coolest example. 

30
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:18,611
This is a much cooler example from the 
real world. 

31
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:21,002
What is this thing? 
Well, this thing here is a 

32
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:24,051
microcontroller. 
So, a very small computer and it's 

33
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,980
attached to a couple light emitting 
diodes, LEDs. 

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,158
With a name like light emitting diode, 
you might think that they light up, and 

35
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:33,926
they could. 
But in this circuit, I'm using the light 

36
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:37,128
emitting diodes in reverse. 
I'm using them as light sensors. 

37
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:40,818
This one happens to be a red one. 
This one happens to be a green one. 

38
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,888
So, what this circuit does is let me 
detect how much red and green light is 

39
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:48,362
falling on these sensors. 
At the other end is a USB cable and it 

40
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:51,130
plugs into my computer so I can record 
the results. 

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,674
The data that I gathered from the real 
world using the microcontroller. 

42
00:02:55,674 --> 00:03:00,888
It's really two different functions. 
A function for the red LED and a function 

43
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,831
for the green LED. 
Along the x-axis, I've plotted the number 

44
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:08,975
of seconds that have elapsed since June 
5th, 2012 at 6:0303 p.m. 

45
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:13,586
And on the y-axis, I'm plotting the 
number of clock cycles it took to 

46
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:17,010
discharge the LED. 
So, what is the red function do? 

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,306
It's input is a number a number of 
seconds that have elapsed since this 

48
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:25,086
particular moment in time. 
It's output is how many clock cycles it 

49
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:28,810
takes at that particular moment in time 
to discharge the red LED. 

50
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,985
Now, this thing was sitting in my 
windowsill, right? 

51
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:35,986
And the sun was rising. 
And as the sun rises, there's more light 

52
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:41,130
shining on the sensors which means fewer 
clock cycles are necessary to discharge 

53
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,861
the LED. 
And you can see that in this graph, 

54
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,909
right? 
The red function is decreasing as the sun 

55
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:49,830
rises. 
There's tons more examples of functions 

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,323
coming from the real world. 
Here's one, human population. 

57
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:56,890
It's a function. 
The input is a year, the output is the 

58
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,126
number of people alive during that year. 
If you want to see this function just 

59
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:07,094
take a look at Wikipedia and their 
article on population growth. There's a 

60
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:12,531
graph of that function, along the x-axis 
is years and along the y-axis is human 

61
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,061
population. 
And as long as researching the Internet, 

62
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,106
here's another example of a real world 
function. 

63
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:23,737
It's a function I'll call f of n, and 
it'll be defined by the rule f of n 

64
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:27,861
equals the number of Google hits when we 
search for the number n. 

65
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:32,775
Let's try it out. 
Let's figure out some values of this 

66
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:37,888
function like f of 188. 
So I plug 188 into Google, and I find 

67
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:44,294
that there's about 1.08 billion hits. 
So, the function at 188 is about a 

68
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:51,602
billion, alright, the input is 188 and 
the output of this function is the number 

69
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:57,377
of Google hits. 
let's try about 4 * 188, that's 752. And 

70
00:04:57,377 --> 00:05:01,527
if I search for that, there's 308 million 
hits, 

71
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:05,858
alright? 
So, f, the function, at 752 is about 300 

72
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:09,694
million. 
if we're persistent, we can plug inn lots 

73
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:13,800
of numbers, and make a really 
nice-looking chart like this. 

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,453
Now, you do this for hundreds of numbers, 
right? 

75
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:20,088
You type them into Google, you see how 
many Google hits you get. 

76
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:23,781
And you can plot them, right? 
It's a function so you can the graph of 

77
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,434
the function. 
Along the x-axis is the number that I 

78
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:30,704
typed into Google. On the y-axis is the 
millions of Google hits that I get. 

79
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:34,396
And when you look at the graph of this 
function, it's not random. 

80
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,204
There's real structure here, right? 
The function is decreasing, right? 

81
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:42,012
Larger values get smaller outputs 
because, you know, there is fewer 

82
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:46,570
webpages that talk about really large 
numbers than about popular small numbers. 

83
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,282
But even more dramatically, when you plot 
this on this special log, log graph 

84
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:55,064
paper, the graph looks like it's sitting 
near a straight line. 

85
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,785
I mean, that's, that's really amazing 
when you think about it. 

86
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:03,621
I mean, this is some sort of pattern 
that's just hidden in the number of pages 

87
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,768
that talk about numbers. 
I mean why? 

88
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:09,840
Where is this coming from, right? 
It's a function from the real world. 

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,800
Input is a number. 
The output is a number. 

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,901
We want to understand that function. 
Calculus is part of the tool kit for 

91
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:19,903
analyzing problems like this. 
So, we've seen what functions do. 

92
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,906
They take their input and they transform 
in into some output. 

93
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,318
And we've even sort of got this mental 
image now, 

94
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,616
this metaphor of a machine. 
A conveyor belt that's transforming the 

95
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:31,520
input into the output. 
We've seen how to build a lot of new 

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,228
functions using algebra. 
or say, composing two functions. 

97
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,875
And we've thought about some real world 
examples. 

98
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:43,145
[MUSIC] Now, we're going to be thinking 
more about functions for the rest of the 

99
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:46,672
term. 
But if you've got questions right now, I 

100
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,434
encourage you to contact me as soon as 
possible. 

101
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:55,294
And I encourage you to get started on the 
homework right away. 

102
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:56,078
Good luck.
