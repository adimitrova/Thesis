1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,265
Here we are at a lecture hall at The Ohio 
State University. 

2
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:13,122
I'm Bart Snap. 
Today, we're going to see how we can use 

3
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:21,797
Calculus to study the path of an object 
through space, in particular this orange 

4
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:22,340
ball. 

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:34,860

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,685
When the ball leaves my hand, it's going 
pretty fast. 

7
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:44,424
But as it approaches the ground, it's 
going faster and faster, and faster until 

8
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:48,470
it hits the ground, bounces up at nearly 
the same speed. 

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,914
And then it's going quickly, but slower, 
slower, slower, until, it reaches its 

10
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:58,770
pinnacle and then it stopped. 
And then it starts falling back down 

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,582
again, slowly at first, but then quicker, 
quicker and quicker, and then I, grab the 

12
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:10,400
ball. 
So how fast was the ball moving well lets 

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,346
see. 
The total distance the ball traveled was 

14
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:28,660
about, 3.14 meters and the total time the 
ball traveled for, was about 1.1 seconds. 

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:37,320
Dividing this, we find this is equal to 
2.85 meters per second. 

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,321
This is the average speed of the ball. 
Now, of course, I took the ball and I 

17
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:50,583
threw it down with some force and then it 
came back up and hovered here and then 

18
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:55,841
came back down if you recall. 
So, what I'm trying to say is the speed 

19
00:01:55,841 --> 00:02:01,871
of the ball was changing the entire time 
and this is the average speed and so 

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,433
sometimes the speed was faster and 
sometimes it was slower. 

21
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:11,063
Here. 
So, think about when I just threw the 

22
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:15,997
ball down. 
From leaving my hand to touching the 

23
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:23,450
ground, that was about 2. seconds. 
And the distance it traveled was about 

24
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,252
one meter. 
One meter divided by 2. seconds is 5 

25
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:37,084
meters per second. 
So we found the average speed to be 2.85 

26
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:41,836
meters per second. 
But that's not really the instantaneous 

27
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:44,937
speed of the ball. 
Because when I threw down the ball, the 

28
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,202
ball was traveling much faster. 
And then the ball bounced up. 

29
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:52,011
And then it started slowing down. 
And then it slowed down to almost no 

30
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:54,949
speed at all. 
And then it came back into my hand going 

31
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,900
a little faster. 
So how do we figure out how fast the 

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,910
balls going at say one of those other 
time intervals. 

33
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,737
We found the average speed over the 
course of the entire trajectory the full 

34
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:14,943
1.1 seconds to be 2.85 meters per second. 
However if we only consider the first 2. 

35
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:20,997
seconds we find the average speed to be 
five meters per second, this makes sense 

36
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:27,051
because if you watch the video you see 
the ball is moving rather quickly in the 

37
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:34,273
first 2. seconds of its trajectory. 
You probably asking yourself, how does 

38
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:40,459
Bart know that the ball traveled one 
meter during the first 2. seconds of its 

39
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,887
journey and 3.14 meters during the whole 
of 1.1 second journey down up and down? 

40
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:50,342
Well, we know this because we got the 
video. 

41
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:55,645
Alright, here Bart is just about to 
release the ball from his hand. 

42
00:03:55,645 --> 00:04:01,270
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 frames later, the 
ball hits the ground. 

43
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,537
There's 30 frames being shot in every 
second so that means that it took 6 / 30 

44
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,797
or 2. seconds for the ball to hit the 
ground. 

45
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:14,751
Making a bunch more measurements, I can 
combine all this information in a graph. 

46
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:19,767
This is a graph of a function the input 
to this function is time so along the x 

47
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:24,533
axis I'm plotting time and seconds. 
The output to the function is the height 

48
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,170
the height of the ball at that particular 
moment in time. 

49
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,722
Now, on this graph, I can go back now and 
try to figure out how fast the ball is 

50
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:38,993
moving at say 4. seconds after Bart 
releases it and at 8. seconds after Bart 

51
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:42,648
releases it. 
So let's try to figure out how fast the 

52
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:47,217
ball is moving at 4. seconds. 
Here I've marked the position of the 

53
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,380
ball, .4 seconds after Bart releases the 
ball. 

54
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,272
Now we don't really have any way of 
figuring how fast the ball is moving at 

55
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,327
that particular moment. 
What I can do is figure out the average 

56
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,160
speed of the ball during some time 
interval. 

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,181
So as sort of a first guess to how fast 
this thing is moving at 4. seconds, I'm 

58
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,751
going to figure out the average speed of 
the ball between 4. seconds and 6. 

59
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,648
seconds. 
Alright, so I've got this handy table 

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:20,802
here, of function values at 4. seconds. 
The the ball was 101.1 centimeters above 

61
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:27,404
the ground and 6. seconds after Bart 
released the ball, the ball was 16.8 

62
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:32,555
centimeters above the ground. 
So I can put that information together to 

63
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:37,924
figure out the speed of the ball between 
4. and 6. seconds. 

64
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:38,940
Alright. 
So 

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,634
4. seconds to say 6. seconds at 4. 
seconds on my chart the ball was a 101.1 

66
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:56,917
centimeters above the ground. 
At 6. seconds the ball was a 161.8 

67
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:04,983
centimeters above the ground. 
Now this time interval has a length of 2. 

68
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:11,567
seconds. 
And how far did the ball move during that 

69
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:16,789
time interval? 
Well 161.8 - 101.1 is 60.7 centimeters. 

70
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:23,751
So during the 2. seconds that elapsed 
from 4. seconds to 6. seconds after Bart 

71
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:30,988
released the ball, the ball traveled a 
distance of 60.7 centimeters, which means 

72
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:40,735
the speed, which is the distance traveled 
over time is 60.7 over 2. centimeters per 

73
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:51,225
second, which is 303.5 centimeters per 
second or 3.035 meters per second. 

74
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:59,990
Which is about seven miles per hour. 
Now I could do a little bit better, 

75
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,423
alright? 
Here I'm calculating the average speed of 

76
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,374
the ball between 4. and 6. seconds, but 
I'm trying to figure out how fast the 

77
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:13,391
ball is moving at this particular moment. 
So instead of just calculating the 

78
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:18,738
average speed during this time interval 
to be about seven miles per hour, I could 

79
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,709
do it over a shorter time interval, all 
right? 

80
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,280
Instead of 6. to 4,. I could go from 4. 
to say 5.. 

81
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,596
Here's half a second after Bart released 
the ball. 

82
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:33,703
And I could figure out the average speed 
of the ball during this part of its 

83
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,556
trajectory. 
Let's see how we calculate that. 

84
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:41,199
Well, it's the same kind of game. 
All right?.4 seconds after Bart released 

85
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,680
the ball, the ball was 101.1 centimeters 
above the ground. 

86
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,319
5. seconds after Barb released the ball, 
looking back at my table I find that the 

87
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,560
ball was 136.5 centimeters above the 
ground. 

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,986
136.5 centimeters. 
This time interval was 1. seconds long. 

89
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:11,412
And how far did the ball move during that 
time interval? 

90
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:18,289
Well, that's 35.4 centimeters. 
136.5 minus 101.1 is 35.4. 

91
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:25,502
So, the ball moved 35.4 centimeters. 
During the point one seconds that elapsed 

92
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:30,189
point four seconds to 5. seconds after 
Bart released the ball. 

93
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:35,545
Speed is how far you've traveled over how 
long it took you so if I divide these 

94
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:41,103
this is the speed of the ball the average 
speed of the ball between point four and 

95
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:46,593
point five seconds and this works out to 
be 354 centimeters per second I mean I'm 

96
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,540
dividing by this very nice number point 
one. 

97
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:56,243
which is the same as 3.45 meters per 
second which is about eight miles per 

98
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,937
hour. 
And indeed, if you look back at this, 

99
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,467
this chart, between 4. and 6. seconds, 
yeah. 

100
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:05,136
Maybe the average speed was u, about 
seven miles per hour. 

101
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:09,311
Between 4. and 5. seconds the average 
speed was a little bit higher. 

102
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:14,435
You know, the average speed here worked 
out to be eight miles per hour instead of 

103
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:18,421
seven miles per hour. 
The average speed of the ball during this 

104
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:22,600
time interval is higher than during this 
whole time interval. 

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,126
We're still not there. 
We are trying to figure out how fast the 

106
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:31,052
ball is moving at this particular moment 
right not the average speed between 4. 

107
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:34,818
and 5. seconds. 
To get closer, right, we should take an 

108
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:39,031
even smaller time interval. 
Instead of 4. to 5. well, why not look 

109
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:44,003
back on our handy chart here and see 
well, here is where the ball is at 4. 

110
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:47,204
seconds. 
Here's where the ball is at 42. seconds. 

111
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:52,994
We could use this information to figure 
out the speed of the ball just during the 

112
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:58,306
very tiny time interval between 4. and 
42. seconds after Bart releases the ball. 

113
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,281
Well, let's do that. 
All right. 

114
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:05,662
So again, .4 seconds after Bart releases 
the ball, the ball is 101.1 centimeters 

115
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:10,528
above the ground. 
.42 seconds after Bart releases the ball, 

116
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:17,674
the ball is 109 centimeters above the 
ground, that's what this chart is telling 

117
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:25,320
me .42 seconds after Bart releases the 
ball, 109 centimeters above the ground. 

118
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,051
So that means during the very tiny time 
interval 02. seconds that elapsed between 

119
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:37,111
4. seconds and 42. seconds after Bart 
releases the ball, the ball has traveled 

120
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:42,777
how far well 109 - 101.1 centimeters is 
just 7.9 centimeters. 

121
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:48,310
So in two hundredths of a second the ball 
has traveled 7.9 centimeters. 

122
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:57,579
To figure out the speed I again divide 
7.9 / 02. is 395 centimeters per second. 

123
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:06,540
Which is 3.95 meters per second. 
Which is about 9 miles per hour. 

124
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,050
This is a much better approximation to 
the instantaneous speed of the ball at 4. 

125
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,684
seconds. 
Look, here's the graph again. 

126
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:21,682
Between point four and point six seconds, 
the ball is travelling maybe seven miles 

127
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,633
per hour on average. 
Between point four and point five 

128
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:31,719
seconds, the ball is travelling maybe. 
Eight miles per hour between 4. and 42. 

129
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:38,398
seconds we just calculated that the speed 
of the ball is about nine miles per hour. 

130
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,778
And that makes a whole lot of sense. 
Right? 

131
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:48,055
The speed of the ball from here to here 
is slower than the average speed from 

132
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:52,320
here to here. 
Which is slower than average speed from 

133
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,883
0.4 to 0.42 seconds. 
The ball's slowing down in its 

134
00:11:55,883 --> 00:12:00,230
trajectory, so the average speed over 
these shorter time intervals is 

135
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,318
decreasing. 
So, let's figure out how fast the ball 

136
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:07,287
was moving at 8. seconds. 
That's when the ball was at the top of 

137
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,933
its trajectory. 
we can't really do that. 

138
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:14,911
All I can really do is figure out the 
average speed of the ball over some time 

139
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:19,320
interval but I've got a table of values 
of the function. 

140
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,969
And I know how high the ball was at 8. 
seconds after release. 

141
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:27,957
It was 182 centimeters, and I can compute 
its average speed over a very short time 

142
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:32,519
interval, like the time interval between 
8. and 81. seconds after release, all 

143
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,378
right? 
And the ball didn't move very far during 

144
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:40,000
that time interval but of course that 
time interval also isn't very long, so 

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,745
it's not super clear how fast the ball 
might be moving on average during that 

146
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:47,604
time interval. 
We can do the calculation though. 

147
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:52,420
Let's do it now, so. 
0.8 seconds after the ball was released, 

148
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,680
the ball was 182 centimeters above the 
ground. 

149
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,156
0.81 seconds after the ball was released, 
the ball was 181.9 centimeters above the 

150
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:09,279
ground. 
Now this time interval between 8. and 81. 

151
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,257
seconds has the duration of just one 
hundredth of a second. 

152
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:17,770
81. - 8. is 01.. 
That's a very short amount of time and 

153
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,360
during that short amount of time, how far 
do the ball move? 

154
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,281
Well, 181.9 - 182 centimeters, that's 
just.1 centimeters. 

155
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:30,424
And if we're being pedantic, it's 
negative 1. centimeters. 

156
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:34,049
All right? 
The ball fell between 8. and 81. seconds, 

157
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:40,116
so this number is recording not only how 
far it moved but also the direction that 

158
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,815
it moved in. 
It's really displacement instead of a 

159
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:47,219
distance. 
Anyhow, .01 centimeters divided by 01. 

160
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:50,548
seconds, that will give me the velocity, 
right? 

161
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:56,978
Displacement over time. 
So if I divide these, this ratio here is 

162
00:13:56,978 --> 00:14:02,515
10 centimeters per second or -10 if I am 
keeping track of the direction its moving 

163
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:05,075
in. 
It's falling down at a speed on average 

164
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,410
of ten centimeters per second during this 
time interval. 

165
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,442
That's -.1 meters per second. 
Which is about.2 miles per hour or -.2 

166
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:19,142
miles hour if I'm keeping track of the 
direction it's going. 

167
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:22,902
Anyway, .2 miles per hour is a really 
slow speed, 

168
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,193
right? 
The ball is not moving very much on 

169
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:31,335
average between 8. and 81. seconds. 
In light of this, it might make sense to 

170
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:36,961
say that the instantaneous speed of the 
ball at.4 seconds is nine miles per hour. 

171
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:40,226
Now, why? 
Well, the average speed between 4. and 6. 

172
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:45,644
seconds is maybe 7 miles per hour. 
The average speed from 4. and 5. is about 

173
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:49,534
eight miles per hour. 
The average speed between 4. and 42. 

174
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,980
seconds is about 9 miles per hour. 
You know and based on this, 

175
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,671
it seems like if we took a really short 
time interval, just after 4. seconds and 

176
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:03,482
tried to calculate how fast the ball was 
going on average during that very small 

177
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,996
time interval, you might conclude that 
the average speed during a very small 

178
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:12,829
time interval is about 9 miles per hour. 
It's in that sense that we're going to 

179
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,797
say that the instantaneous speed of the 
ball at point four seconds is 9 miles per 

180
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,772
hour. 
When you play the same game 8. seconds 

181
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:25,290
into the balls journey, alright. 
When it's just to the top of its 

182
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,396
trajectory. 
So the average speed of the ball, between 

183
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:33,972
8. and 81. seconds is exceedingly slow, 
and you can see that in the video, 

184
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:37,361
alright. 
The ball is barely moving, at the top of 

185
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:42,014
its trajectory. 
What's the instantaneous speed of the 

186
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:45,414
ball at the top of its trajectory? 
It's zero, right? 

187
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:49,177
I mean yes. 
The average speed over a time interval 

188
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:52,263
between 8. and 8000001. seconds isn't 
zero. 

189
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:58,435
But if you look at an average speed over 
an exceedingly small time interval, those 

190
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:04,381
average speeds over shorter and shorter 
time intervals are as close to zero as 

191
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,317
you like. 
That's the sense in which the 

192
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:13,112
instantaneous velocity at the top of the 
trajectory, the limit of the average 

193
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,960
velocities over small time intervals, is 
zero. 

194
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:25,883
Isn't calculus amazing? 
We're using the idea of limits to compute 

195
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:33,296
instantaneous speed. 
Using a little bit of math, we can 

196
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:41,532
understand the world around us. 
That's the power of calculus. 

197
