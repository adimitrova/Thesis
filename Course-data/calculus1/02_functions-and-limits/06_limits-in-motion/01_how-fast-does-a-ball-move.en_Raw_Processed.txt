here we a lecture hall ohio 
state university 
im bart snap 
today, going to see we use 
calculus to study path an object 
space, in particular this orange 
ball 
ball leaves hand, going 
pretty fast 
approaches ground, 
going faster faster, faster until 
hits ground, bounces nearly 
speed 
going quickly, slower, 
slower, slower, until, reaches 
pinnacle stopped 
starts falling back 
again, slowly first, quicker, 
quicker quicker, i, grab 
ball 
so fast ball moving well lets 
see 
total distance ball traveled 
about, meters total time 
ball traveled for, seconds 
dividing this, we find this is equal to 
meters per second 
this is average speed ball 
now, course, i took ball i 
threw force 
came back hovered here 
came back if you recall 
so, im trying to say is speed 
ball changing entire time 
this is average speed so 
sometimes speed faster 
sometimes slower 
here 
so, think i threw 
ball 
leaving hand to touching 
ground, that seconds 
distance traveled 
one meter 
one meter divided seconds is 
meters per second 
so we found average speed to 
meters per second 
thats really instantaneous 
speed ball 
i threw ball, 
ball traveling much faster 
ball bounced 
started slowing 
slowed to almost 
speed 
came back hand going 
a little faster 
so we figure fast 
balls going say one 
time intervals 
we found average speed 
course entire trajectory full 
seconds to meters per second 
however if we consider first 
seconds we find average speed to 
five meters per second, this makes sense 
if you watch video you see 
ball is moving rather quickly in 
first seconds trajectory 
you probably asking yourself, 
bart know that ball traveled one 
meter first seconds 
journey meters whole 
second journey 
well, we know this we got 
video 
alright, here bart is to 
release ball hand 
, , , , , frames later, 
ball hits ground 
theres frames shot in every 
second so that means that took 
seconds ball to hit 
ground 
making a bunch measurements, i 
combine this information in a graph 
this is a graph a function input 
to this function is time so along x 
axis im plotting time seconds 
output to function is height 
height ball that particular 
moment in time 
now, this graph, i go back 
try to figure fast ball is 
moving say seconds bart 
releases seconds bart 
releases 
so lets try to figure fast 
ball is moving seconds 
here ive marked position 
ball, seconds bart releases 
ball 
we dont really way 
figuring fast ball is moving 
that particular moment 
i is figure average 
speed ball time 
interval 
so sort a first guess to fast 
this thing is moving seconds, im 
going to figure average speed 
ball between seconds 
seconds 
alright, so ive got this handy table 
here, function values seconds 
ball centimeters 
ground seconds bart 
released ball, ball 
centimeters ground 
so i put that information together to 
figure speed ball between 
seconds 
alright 
so 
seconds to say seconds 
seconds chart ball a 
centimeters ground 
seconds ball a 
centimeters ground 
this time interval a length 
seconds 
far ball move that 
time interval 
well is centimeters 
so seconds that elapsed 
seconds to seconds bart 
released ball, ball traveled a 
distance centimeters, means 
speed, is distance traveled 
time is centimeters per 
second, is centimeters per 
second meters per second 
is seven miles per hour 
i could a little bit better, 
alright 
here im calculating average speed 
ball between seconds, 
im trying to figure fast 
ball is moving this particular moment 
so instead calculating 
average speed this time interval 
to seven miles per hour, i could 
a shorter time interval, 
right 
instead to , i could go 
to say 
heres half a second bart released 
ball 
i could figure average speed 
ball this part 
trajectory 
lets see we calculate that 
well, kind game 
right seconds bart released 
ball, ball centimeters 
ground 
seconds barb released ball, 
looking back table i find that 
ball centimeters 
ground 
centimeters 
this time interval seconds long 
far ball move that 
time interval 
well, thats centimeters 
minus is 
so, ball moved centimeters 
point one seconds that elapsed 
point four seconds to seconds 
bart released ball 
speed is far youve traveled 
long took you so if i divide 
this is speed ball average 
speed ball between point four 
point five seconds this works to 
centimeters per second i mean im 
dividing this nice number point 
one 
is meters per 
second is eight miles per 
hour 
indeed, if you look back this, 
this chart, between seconds, 
yeah 
maybe average speed u, 
seven miles per hour 
between seconds average 
speed a little bit higher 
you know, average speed here worked 
to eight miles per hour instead 
seven miles per hour 
average speed ball this 
time interval is higher this 
whole time interval 
still there 
we trying to figure fast 
ball is moving this particular moment 
right average speed between 
seconds 
to get closer, right, we take an 
even smaller time interval 
instead to well, look 
back handy chart here see 
well, here is ball is 
seconds 
heres ball is seconds 
we could use this information to figure 
speed ball 
tiny time interval between 
seconds bart releases ball 
well, lets that 
right 
so again, seconds bart releases 
ball, ball is centimeters 
ground 
seconds bart releases ball, 
ball is centimeters 
ground, thats this chart is telling 
seconds bart releases 
ball, centimeters ground 
so that means tiny time 
interval seconds that elapsed between 
seconds seconds bart 
releases ball, ball traveled 
far well centimeters is 
centimeters 
so in two hundredths a second ball 
traveled centimeters 
to figure speed i divide 
is centimeters per second 
is meters per second 
is miles per hour 
this is a much better approximation to 
instantaneous speed ball 
seconds 
look, heres graph 
between point four point six seconds, 
ball is travelling maybe seven miles 
per hour average 
between point four point five 
seconds, ball is travelling maybe 
eight miles per hour between 
seconds we calculated that speed 
ball is nine miles per hour 
that makes a whole lot sense 
right 
speed ball here to here 
is slower average speed 
here to here 
is slower average speed 
to seconds 
balls slowing in 
trajectory, so average speed 
shorter time intervals is 
decreasing 
so, lets figure fast ball 
moving seconds 
thats ball top 
trajectory 
we cant really that 
i really is figure 
average speed ball time 
interval ive got a table values 
function 
i know high ball 
seconds release 
centimeters, i compute 
average speed a short time 
interval, like time interval between 
seconds release, 
right 
ball didnt move far 
that time interval course that 
time interval also isnt long, so 
super clear fast ball 
might moving average that 
time interval 
we calculation though 
lets now, so 
seconds ball released, 
ball centimeters 
ground 
seconds ball released, 
ball centimeters 
ground 
this time interval between 
seconds duration one 
hundredth a second 
is 
thats a short amount time 
that short amount time, far 
ball move 
well, centimeters, thats 
centimeters 
if pedantic, 
negative centimeters 
right 
ball fell between seconds, 
so this number is recording 
far moved also direction that 
moved in 
really displacement instead a 
distance 
anyhow, centimeters divided 
seconds, that will give velocity, 
right 
displacement time 
so if i divide these, this ratio here is 
centimeters per second if i 
keeping track direction moving 
in 
falling a speed average 
ten centimeters per second this 
time interval 
thats meters per second 
is miles per hour 
miles hour if im keeping track 
direction going 
anyway, miles per hour is a really 
slow speed, 
right 
ball is moving much 
average between seconds 
in light this, might make sense to 
say that instantaneous speed 
ball seconds is nine miles per hour 
now, 
well, average speed between 
seconds is maybe miles per hour 
average speed is 
eight miles per hour 
average speed between 
seconds is miles per hour 
you know based this, 
seems like if we took a really short 
time interval, seconds 
tried to calculate fast ball 
going average that small 
time interval, you might conclude that 
average speed a small 
time interval is miles per hour 
in that sense that going to 
say that instantaneous speed 
ball point four seconds is miles per 
hour 
you play game seconds 
balls journey, alright 
to top 
trajectory 
so average speed ball, between 
seconds is exceedingly slow, 
you see that in video, 
alright 
ball is barely moving, top 
trajectory 
whats instantaneous speed 
ball top trajectory 
zero, right 
i mean yes 
average speed a time interval 
between seconds isnt 
zero 
if you look an average speed 
an exceedingly small time interval, 
average speeds shorter shorter 
time intervals close to zero 
you like 
thats sense in 
instantaneous velocity top 
trajectory, limit average 
velocities small time intervals, is 
zero 
isnt calculus amazing 
using idea limits to compute 
instantaneous speed 
using a little bit math, we 
understand world around us 
thats power calculus 
music
