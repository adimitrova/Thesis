well now, time to calculus 
calculus is relationships 
throughout world, 
theres quantities 
quantities 
connected together 
well so 
maybe one quantities is 
input to sort machine, 
sort mathematical expression 
that transforms that quantity in 
to a new quantity, an output quantity 
maybe two quantities forced 
to vary together reason 
maybe youve got a table 
numbers that tell you 
to take certain input values 
to certain output values 
maybe youve got a graph that 
youre reading that tells you 
to take an x coordinate 
output a y coordinate 
regardless you 
conceptualize this idea, 
theres relationships between different 
quantities in real world 
often encoding 
relationships functions 
big idea i wanna 
think limits 
sometimes im interested in 
a functions value a single point 
sometimes i wanna know happens 
if i evaluated that function 
nearby points well 
try to make sense that precisely, 
thats limits gonna us 
so to begin quest in calculus, 
gonna look two big ideas 
gonna look functions 
gonna look limits
