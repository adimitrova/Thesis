2
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:07,500
Well now, it's time to do some calculus.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,050
Calculus is all about relationships.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,260
All throughout the world,
there's these quantities.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,930
And some of those quantities
are connected together.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,390
Well how so?

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,980
Maybe one of those quantities is
the input to some sort of machine,

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,010
or some sort of mathematical expression
that transforms that quantity in

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,001
to a new quantity, an output quantity.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,710
Maybe two of those quantities are forced
to vary together for some reason.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,360
Maybe you've just got a table
of numbers that tell you

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,484
how to take certain input values
to certain output values.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,970
Maybe you've got a graph that
you're reading that tells you

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,130
how to take an x coordinate and
output a y coordinate.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,570
But regardless of how you
conceptualize this idea,

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,700
there's relationships between different
quantities in the real world and

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,249
we're often encoding those
relationships through functions.

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,630
The other big idea I wanna
think about now are limits.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,980
Sometimes I'm not just interested in
a function's value at a single point.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,770
Sometimes I wanna know what happens
if I evaluated that function

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,670
at nearby points as well.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,120
And try to make sense of that precisely,
that's what limits are gonna do for us.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,309
So to begin our quest in calculus,
we're gonna look at two big ideas.

24
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:31,817
We're gonna look at functions and
we're gonna look at limits.
