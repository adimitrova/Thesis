00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,264
[MUSIC] We want to capture precise 
information about how wiggling the input 

2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:11,350
effects the output. 
Here's the difinition of derivative that 

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,983
will allow us to do exactly that. 
The derivative of f at the point x is 

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:21,916
defined to be this limit. 
The limit of f(x+h)-f(x)/h as h 

5
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:26,063
approaches 0. 
Now, when this limit exists, I'm going to 

6
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:29,582
say the function is differentiable, 
alright? 

7
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:35,287
If the derivative of f exists at the 
point x, I'm going to to say the function 

8
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:40,217
is differentiable at that point x. 
Sometimes, you'll see different 

9
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:44,191
definitions of the derivative. 
Here's an equivalent one. 

10
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,873
The derivative of f at x could 
equivalently be defined as this limit, 

11
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:52,717
the limit as w approaches x of f(w)-f(x) 
all over w-x. 

12
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:58,082
Now, how does this definition relate to 
our original definition of derivative? 

13
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:01,539
The derivative of f at x is this limit 
involving h. 

14
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,638
Well, look. 
In both cases, the numerators are 

15
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:10,145
measuring how the output is changing. 
Here, I'm plugging in a nearby input and 

16
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:14,913
I'm looking at how much the output 
changed compared to the output at x. 

17
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:18,912
And h is measuring exactly how much that 
input changed by. 

18
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,787
Here, I'm again measuring the difference 
of two output values. 

19
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:26,017
Here, w is my new output value, which is 
close to x. 

20
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:29,992
Alright, down here, h is just measuring 
how much I wiggled x by. 

21
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:33,003
Here, w is actually just some nearby 
value of x. 

22
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:38,058
And in both cases, the denominator is 
measuring how much the input was changed. 

23
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,382
Here, h is exactly how much the input was 
changed by. 

24
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:46,492
Here, w-x is measuring how much the input 
changed by. The other thing that makes 

25
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:51,092
these definitions sometimes a little bit 
tricky is that people will give you a 

26
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:55,872
definition that's not at the point of x. 
For instance, here's a definition of the 

27
00:01:55,872 --> 00:02:00,787
derivative of f at the point a. 
It's the limit of f(x)-f(a)/x-a as x 

28
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,144
approaches a. 
You can compare the first and the third 

29
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,714
definitions here. 
This first one has a w and an x and w is 

30
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:12,825
approaching x to get the derivative at x. 
This bottom one, I'm trying to compute 

31
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:17,798
the derivative at a and x is approaching 
a, alright? So, the roles of w and x and 

32
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,819
the role of x and a are somehow analogous 
here. 

33
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,395
Now, think back to when we were talking 
about continuity last week. 

34
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,676
We started out with a definition of 
continuity at a single point and then we 

35
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:32,290
expanded that definition to be continuity 
on a whole interval. 

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,949
We played the same game with the 
derivative. Here we go. 

37
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:41,122
If the derivative of f exists at x, 
whenever x is between a and b, but not at 

38
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:45,734
a, or at b, we won't worry about that, 
just whenever x is between a and b. 

39
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,445
And if this happens, then, we say that f 
is differentiable on the interval (a,b). 

40
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,693
So, as a little bit of a warning here, 
this is not a point. 

41
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:57,850
This is an interval. 
It's all the numbers between a and b, 

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,472
not including a, 
not including b. 

43
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:18,554
Now, contrast this with continuity, 
when we talked about continuity on an 

44
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:18,554
interval, 
I also had separate definitions for 

45
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:18,554
continuity and closed intervals or 
half-open intervals. 

46
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:18,554
But that doesn't really make so much 
sense for the derivative. 

47
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:18,554
here's why. 
The derivative is measuring how much 

48
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:21,178
wiggling x affects f(x). 
And if I'm standing in the middle of an 

49
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:27,222
interval, I can wiggle x. 
Even if I'm standing pretty close to b or 

50
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:31,442
pretty close to a, I can always wiggle 
just a little bit to the left and a 

51
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:36,077
little bit to the right, no matter how 
close I'm standing to a or how close I'm 

52
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:39,442
standing to b, unless I'm standing, say, 
at the point b. 

53
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:42,622
If I'm standing right at b, I can wiggle 
to the left. 

54
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,718
But I can't wiggle at all to the right 
without walking right outside of the 

55
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,626
interval. 
So, in light of this, I don't really want 

56
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:51,632
to talk about differentiability on closed 
intervals. 

57
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,348
I only want to talk about 
differentiablity when I can honestly talk 

58
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:59,150
about wiggling the input and that's only 
true on open intervals. 

59
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,642
There's plenty of other subtleties to 
this. 

60
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:07,445
If I differentiate a function which is 
differentiable on a whole interval, then 

61
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:13,373
I get a new function, f'. Specifically, 
the derivative of f at the point x will 

62
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:17,740
be written like this, f with this little 
tick mark, and we're going to pronounce 

63
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,220
that prime, f'(x). 
The point here is that I can define the 

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,438
derivative, right, as this limit of this 
quotient. 

65
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:30,537
And when you think of it this way, if 
this is really a function, right? This is 

66
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:36,245
a rule that defines some new function, so 
I can regard f'(x) not just as a specific 

67
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:41,452
values that I get by plugging specific 
values of x, but honestly as a function. 

68
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:44,317
Alright. 
This thing is the sort of thing I can 

69
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,232
plug any value of x into and see what I 
get out. 

70
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:50,047
It's a function that somehow derived from 
f. 

71
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,337
Maybe hence, the name derivative. 
There's a whole bunch of different 

72
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:58,472
notation that you're going to see for the 
derivative in the wild. 

73
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:02,557
Here are some of these. 
Alright, the derivitive of f at the point 

74
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:06,197
x might be written as f'(x), like we've 
just been seeing. 

75
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:10,612
Or it might be written d/dxf(x) or 
Dxf(x), or a bunch of other things, 

76
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,862
right? 
Lots of different people have their 

77
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:17,412
favorite notation for these. 
But really, this f' notation and this 

78
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:21,322
d/dx notation are what we're going to be 
using in this course. 

79
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:26,283
There are upsides and downsides to these 
various choices of notation. 

80
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:30,425
For instance, here's a huge upside to 
this d/dx notation. 

81
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:35,515
It's really emphasizing that the 
derivative is a ratio, right? It looks 

82
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:40,547
like df, the change in the output, dx, 
the change in the input, somehow 

83
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:45,202
revealing a little bit of how the 
derivative is actually defined. 

84
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:50,342
The f'(x) notation doesn't emphasize that 
the derivative is a ratio, but it does 

85
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:55,202
emphasize the derivative is a function. 
When we use the f'(x) notation, at least 

86
00:05:55,202 --> 00:06:00,062
you can tell this thing is a function. 
You've clearly labeled the input, x. 

87
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:03,725
Differentiating gives a new function, 
even the name suggests that. 

88
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,102
The derivative is somehow derived from 
the original function. 

89
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:10,933
And if the derivative is now a function, 
you can then differentiate the 

90
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,577
derivative. 
And differentiate that, and keep on 

91
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,010
going. 
And dig deeper and deeper and deeper, 

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,151
trying to uncover more and more secrets 
about the original function, 

93
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:24,837
f. 
All of that is yet to come. 

94
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:33,015
But the point is just that there's so 
much yet to explore. 

95
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,170
