here
i
've
graphed
some
function
.
notice
what
happens
if
i
zoom
in
on
one
little
piece
of
the
graph
,
right
?
if
i
just
focus
on
one
part
of
the
graph
,
well
,
that
little
bit
of
graph
sort
of
looks
like
part
of
a
straight
line
.
another
way
to
think
about
this
is
as
a
limit
of
secant
lines
.
by
secant
line
,
i
mean
,
i
'm
going
to
pick
two
points
on
the
graph
and
i
'm
going
to
put
a
line
,
the
secant
line
,
through
those
two
points
.
but
,
i
can
do
better
.
by
taking
this
point
and
moving
it
closer
to
a
,
this
red
line
is
going
to
be
a
better
approximation
to
the
orange
curve
near
the
point
a.
so
,
instead
of
putting
it
through
those
two
points
,
let
me
put
the
secant
line
through
,
say
,
these
two
points
,
this
point
at
a
and
this
point
that
's
nearby
.
and
now
,
the
line
segment
through
those
two
points
is
a
much
better
approximation
of
the
orange
curve
.
and
i
can
do
better
and
better
by
taking
a
limit
,
by
putting
those
two
points
closer
and
closer
together
,
i
can
get
my
secant
line
to
be
a
better
and
better
approximation
to
the
orange
curve
near
the
point
a.
what
we
're
really
calculating
here
is
a
limit
.
so
here
,
i
've
got
an
input
a
and
an
input
a+h
,
and
here
are
the
corresponding
points
on
the
graph
of
the
function
.
i
'm
going
to
put
a
secant
line
through
those
points
.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
's
the
slope
of
that
secant
line
because
i
'm
going
to
take
the
limit
as
this
a+h
point
is
moved
closer
to
a
as
h
goes
to
zero
in
other
words
,
and
that
'll
make
this
secant
line
move
closer
and
closer
to
the
tangent
line
,
to
the
curve
.
okay
,
so
what
's
the
slope
of
the
secant
line
?
well
,
the
rise
is
f
(
a
)
+h-f
(
a
)
.
the
run
is
h.
so
,
the
slope
of
that
secant
line
is
this
,
f
(
a+h
)
-f
(
a
)
/h
.
if
i
take
the
limit
as
h
goes
to
0
,
i
get
this
:
the
limit
as
h
goes
to
0
of
this
slope
.
we
've
seen
this
,
this
is
the
derivative
of
the
function
at
the
point
a.
let
's
find
the
equation
of
the
tangent
line
in
a
concrete
example
.
here
's
a
graph
of
y=x^2
.
let
's
figure
out
the
equation
of
the
tangent
line
to
that
graph
at
the
point
(
3,9
)
.
so
to
do
that
,
we
're
going
to
use
the
derivative
and
i
know
that
the
derivative
of
x^2
is
2x
.
so
,
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
at
the
point
3
is
2*3=6
,
and
that
's
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
.
i
also
know
a
point
that
the
tangent
line
passes
through
.
it
should
be
passing
through
the
point
(
3,9
)
,
right
?
the
point
(
3,9
)
is
on
the
tangent
line
.
so
,
if
i
know
the
slope
of
the
tangent
line
and
i
know
a
point
on
the
line
,
i
can
write
down
an
equation
for
the
line
using
point
slope
form
.
so
,
y
minus
the
y
coordinate
on
the
line
is
the
slope
time
x
minus
the
x
coordinate
on
the
line
.
so
,
this
is
an
equation
for
this
red
tangent
line
.
