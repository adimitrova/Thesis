i say a function is differentiable, 
i really mean is that i zoom 
in, function looks like a straight 
line 
this is graph absolute value 
function 
lets zoom in origin 
matter much i zoom in, this graph 
doesnt look like a straight line 
consequently, absolute value function 
is differentiable 
we also see this limit 
definition derivative 
so we going to name absolute 
value function f, time 
i trying to calculate is 
derivative f 
i want to know is this function 
differentiable 
definition derivative is 
limit 
h approaches , function, 
h h 
i simplify that a bit 
absolute value h, is 
absolute value h, absolute 
value , so i dont even need to 
subtract 
im dividing h 
whats limit approaches 
absolute value hh 
that limit doesnt exist consequently 
this functions differential zero 
if you wonder that limit doesnt 
exist, well think back to sided 
sided limit discussion 
whats limit h approaches 
righthand side h h 
well whats limit h approaches 
lefthand side h h 
is equal to 
onesided limits disagree 
two sided limit doesnt exist 
this limit calculating derivative 
means that this function is 
differentiable 
course, that raises question 
you care differentiable 
functions 
heres terrible looking function 
differentiable 
so if i zoom in point, thing 
looks like a straight line 
calculus is replacing 
curved objects that we cant understand 
straight lines, we 
hope understanding 
music
