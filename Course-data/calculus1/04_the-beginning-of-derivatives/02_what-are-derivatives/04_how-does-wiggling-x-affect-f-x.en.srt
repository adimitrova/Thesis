00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,576
[MUSIC] Remember, f prime of x is 
encoding how wiggling x affects f of x. 

2
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:14,492
We can see this by thinking about slopes 
of tangent lines as well. 

3
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:21,012
Here, I've drawn in orange the graph of 
some random function y=f(x). 

4
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:27,582
And this point, a f(a) I've drawn in red 
the tangent line to the graph. 

5
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:34,533
I want to know how is the output f 
affected when input moves from a to a+h. 

6
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:39,113
I want to know what happens when I wiggle 
the input over by adding h. 

7
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:42,048
Let me zoom in on this picture a little 
bit. 

8
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:47,008
Here, I've got this tangent line, and the 
slope of that tangent line is the 

9
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,922
derivative of the function at the point 
a. 

10
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:55,887
That means that this triangle can be 
understood, right? This slope being 

11
00:00:55,887 --> 00:01:00,173
f'(a), this base being h means this 
height is h*f'(a). 

12
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:09,227
In order to get this slope as f'(a), rise 
over run better be equal to f'(a), this 

13
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:14,637
divided by this is f'(a). 
this is giving me some information about 

14
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:17,982
how wiggling the input will affect the 
output. 

15
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:23,517
If I move from a to a+h, well, on the 
tangent line m' moving up to this point 

16
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:28,052
which isn't so far off of the real value 
of the function up here. 

17
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:33,227
Now, if I made h really, really small, 
I'd be doing an even better job of 

18
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:37,567
staying close to the graph of the 
function when I follow the tangent line. 

19
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:42,362
Instead of starting with the function and 
trying to figure out the derivative, we 

20
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:47,092
can imagine that we know a little bit of 
information about the derivative and try 

21
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,697
to figure out something about the 
function. 

22
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,882
Let's make up a concrete example. 
Suppose that I've got some function f, 

23
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:58,940
and all I know is that its derivative is 
3x, and its value at 2, is 4. 

24
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:06,149
Just knowing this information without a 
rule for the function at this point, can 

25
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,682
I say anything about the function's value 
at, say 2.01? Yes, I can. 

26
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:23,517
Right? f(2.01), well that's f(2) plus how 
much the output changes when I go from 2 

27
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:27,854
to 2.01. 
Well, the output change is approximately 

28
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:31,775
something that I can compute from the 
derivative, 

29
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,093
right? 
The derivative is infinitesimally the 

30
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:38,685
ratio between output change and input 
change. 

31
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:44,957
So if I multiply by how much I change the 
input by the ratio of input change to 

32
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:49,997
output change, 
this should be approximately the true 

33
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:54,816
output change. 
Now, in this case, I know what these 

34
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:59,289
numbers are. 
0.01 times the derivative of f(2) is 6. 

35
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:04,372
Which means that this is about 4+0.06 
which is 4.06. 

36
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:09,812
And that's about what this function at 
2.01 is equal to. 

37
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:17,825
One more cat moves into the neighborhood. 
What happens to the mouse population? 

38
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:24,078
Right? A small change to one thing will 
affect something else. 

39
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:28,940
That's what the derivative is encoding.
