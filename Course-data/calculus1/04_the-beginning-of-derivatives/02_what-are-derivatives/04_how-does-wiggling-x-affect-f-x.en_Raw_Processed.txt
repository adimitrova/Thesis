music remember, f prime x is 
encoding wiggling x affects f x 
we see this thinking slopes 
tangent lines well 
here, ive drawn in orange graph 
random function yfx 
this point, a fa ive drawn in red 
tangent line to graph 
i want to know is output f 
affected input moves a to ah 
i want to know happens i wiggle 
input adding h 
let zoom in this picture a little 
bit 
here, ive got this tangent line, 
slope that tangent line is 
derivative function point 
a 
that means that this triangle 
understood, right this slope 
fa, this base h means this 
height is hfa 
in order to get this slope fa, rise 
run better equal to fa, this 
divided this is fa 
this is giving information 
wiggling input will affect 
output 
if i move a to ah, well, 
tangent line m moving to this point 
isnt so far real value 
function here 
now, if i made h really, really small, 
id an even better job 
staying close to graph 
function i follow tangent line 
instead starting function 
trying to figure derivative, we 
imagine that we know a little bit 
information derivative try 
to figure something 
function 
lets make a concrete example 
suppose that ive got function f, 
i know is that derivative is 
x, value , is 
knowing this information without a 
rule function this point, 
i say anything functions value 
at, say yes, i 
right f, well thats f plus 
much output changes i go 
to 
well, output change is approximately 
something that i compute 
derivative, 
right 
derivative is infinitesimally 
ratio between output change input 
change 
so if i multiply much i change 
input ratio input change to 
output change, 
this approximately true 
output change 
now, in this case, i know 
numbers 
times derivative f is 
means that this is 
is 
thats this function 
is equal to 
one cat moves neighborhood 
happens to mouse population 
right a small change to one thing will 
affect something else 
thats derivative is encoding
