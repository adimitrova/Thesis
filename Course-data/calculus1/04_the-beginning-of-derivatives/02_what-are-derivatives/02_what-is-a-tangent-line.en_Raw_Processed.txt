music here ive graphed function 
notice happens if i zoom in one 
little piece graph, 
right 
if i focus one part graph, 
well, that little bit graph sort 
looks like part a straight line 
another way to think this is a 
limit secant lines 
secant line, i mean, im going to pick 
two points graph im going to 
put a line, secant line, 
two points 
but, i better 
taking this point moving closer 
to a, this red line is going to a 
better approximation to orange curve 
near point a 
so, instead putting 
two points, let put secant line 
through, say, two points, this 
point a this point thats nearby 
now, line segment 
two points is a much better approximation 
orange curve 
i better better taking 
a limit, putting two points 
closer closer together, i get 
secant line to a better better 
approximation to orange curve near 
point a 
really calculating here is a 
limit 
so here, ive got an input a an input 
ah, here corresponding 
points graph function 
im going to put a secant line 
points 
i want to know is whats slope 
that secant line im going to 
take limit this ah point is moved 
closer to a h goes to zero in 
words, thatll make this secant line 
move closer closer to tangent 
line, 
to curve 
okay, so whats slope secant 
line 
well, rise is fahfa 
run is h 
so, slope that secant line is 
this, fahfah 
if i take limit h goes to , i get 
this limit h goes to this 
slope 
weve seen this, this is derivative 
function point a 
lets find equation tangent 
line in a concrete example 
heres a graph yx 
lets figure equation 
tangent line to that graph point 
, 
so to that, going to use 
derivative i know that derivative 
x is x 
so, slope tangent line 
point is , 
thats slope tangent line 
i also know a point that tangent line 
passes 
passing point 
,, right point , is 
tangent line 
so, if i know slope tangent 
line i know a point line, i 
write an equation line 
using point slope form 
so, y minus y coordinate line 
is slope time x minus x 
coordinate line 
so, this is an equation this red 
tangent line
