when i say a function is differentiable,  what i really mean is that when i zoom  in, the function looks like a straight  line.
this is the graph of the absolute value  function.
let's zoom in on the origin.
no matter how much i zoom in, this graph  doesn't look like a straight line.
consequently, the absolute value function  is not differentiable at 0.  we can also see this from the limit  definition of derivative.
so we just going to name the absolute  value function f, for the time being.
what i am trying to calculate is the  derivative of f at 0.  i want to know is this function  differentiable at 0.  by the definition the derivative is the  limit.
as h approaches 0, of the function, at |0  + h| - |0| / h.  now i can simplify that a bit.
the absolute value of 0 + h, is just the  absolute value of h, and the absolute  value of 0, so i don't even need to  subtract 0.  and i"m dividing by h.  now what's the limit as it approaches 0  of absolute value h/h.
that limit doesn't exist and consequently  this function's not differential at zero.
if you wonder why that limit doesn't  exist, well think back to our 2 sided 1  sided limit discussion from before.
what's the limit as h approaches 0 from  the right-hand side of |h| / h?
it's 1.  well what's the limit as h approaches 0  from the left-hand side of |h| / h?
it's  -1.  and 1 is not equal to -1.  because the one-sided limits disagree the  two sided limit doesn't exist.
and this limit calculating the derivative  means that this function is not  differentiable at 0.  of course, that raises the question why  should you care about differentiable  functions at all?
here's some terrible looking function.
but it's differentiable.
so if i zoom in on some point, the thing  looks like a straight line.
calculus is all about replacing the  curved objects that we can't understand  with straight lines, which we have some  hope of understanding.
