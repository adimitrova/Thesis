music we want to capture precise 
information wiggling input 
effects output 
heres difinition derivative that 
will allow us to exactly that 
derivative f point x is 
defined to this limit 
limit fxhfxh h 
approaches 
now, this limit exists, im going to 
say function is differentiable, 
alright 
if derivative f exists 
point x, im going to to say function 
is differentiable that point x 
sometimes, youll see different 
definitions derivative 
heres an equivalent one 
derivative f x could 
equivalently defined this limit, 
limit w approaches x fwfx 
wx 
now, this definition relate to 
original definition derivative 
derivative f x is this limit 
involving h 
well, look 
in cases, numerators 
measuring output is changing 
here, im plugging in a nearby input 
im looking much output 
changed compared to output x 
h is measuring exactly much that 
input changed 
here, im measuring difference 
two output values 
here, w is new output value, is 
close to x 
alright, here, h is measuring 
much i wiggled x 
here, w is actually nearby 
value x 
in cases, denominator is 
measuring much input changed 
here, h is exactly much input 
changed 
here, wx is measuring much input 
changed thing that makes 
definitions sometimes a little bit 
tricky is that people will give you a 
definition thats point x 
instance, heres a definition 
derivative f point a 
limit fxfaxa x 
approaches a 
you compare first third 
definitions here 
this first one a w an x w is 
approaching x to get derivative x 
this bottom one, im trying to compute 
derivative a x is approaching 
a, alright so, roles w x 
role x a somehow analogous 
here 
now, think back to we talking 
continuity last week 
we started a definition 
continuity a single point we 
expanded that definition to continuity 
a whole interval 
we played game 
derivative here we go 
if derivative f exists x, 
whenever x is between a b, 
a, b, we wont worry that, 
whenever x is between a b 
if this happens, then, we say that f 
is differentiable interval a,b 
so, a little bit a warning here, 
this is a point 
this is an interval 
numbers between a b, 
including a, 
including b 
now, contrast this continuity, 
we talked continuity an 
interval, 
i also separate definitions 
continuity closed intervals 
halfopen intervals 
that doesnt really make so much 
sense derivative 
heres 
derivative is measuring much 
wiggling x affects fx 
if im standing in middle an 
interval, i wiggle x 
even if im standing pretty close to b 
pretty close to a, i always wiggle 
a little bit to left a 
little bit to right, matter 
close im standing to a close im 
standing to b, unless im standing, say, 
point b 
if im standing right b, i wiggle 
to left 
i cant wiggle to right 
without walking right outside 
interval 
so, in light this, i dont really want 
to talk differentiability closed 
intervals 
i want to talk 
differentiablity i honestly talk 
wiggling input thats 
true open intervals 
theres plenty subtleties to 
this 
if i differentiate a function is 
differentiable a whole interval, 
i get a new function, f specifically, 
derivative f point x will 
written like this, f this little 
tick mark, going to pronounce 
that prime, fx 
point here is that i define 
derivative, right, this limit this 
quotient 
you think this way, if 
this is really a function, right this is 
a rule that defines new function, so 
i regard fx a specific 
values that i get plugging specific 
values x, honestly a function 
alright 
this thing is sort thing i 
plug value x see i 
get 
a function that somehow derived 
f 
maybe hence, name derivative 
theres a whole bunch different 
notation that youre going to see 
derivative in wild 
here 
alright, derivitive f point 
x might written fx, like weve 
seeing 
might written ddxfx 
dxfx, a bunch things, 
right 
lots different people 
favorite notation 
really, this f notation this 
ddx notation going to 
using in this course 
there upsides downsides to 
various choices notation 
instance, heres a huge upside to 
this ddx notation 
really emphasizing that 
derivative is a ratio, right looks 
like df, change in output, dx, 
change in input, somehow 
revealing a little bit 
derivative is actually defined 
fx notation doesnt emphasize that 
derivative is a ratio, 
emphasize derivative is a function 
we use fx notation, least 
you tell this thing is a function 
youve clearly labeled input, x 
differentiating gives a new function, 
even name suggests that 
derivative is somehow derived 
original function 
if derivative is a function, 
you differentiate 
derivative 
differentiate that, keep 
going 
dig deeper deeper deeper, 
trying to uncover secrets 
original function, 
f 
that is yet to come 
point is that theres so 
much yet to explore
