When I say a function is differentiable, 

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,271
what I really mean is that when I zoom 
in, the function looks like a straight 

3
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:15,332
line. 
This is the graph of the absolute value 

4
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:18,713
function. 
Let's zoom in on the origin. 

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,009
No matter how much I zoom in, this graph 
doesn't look like a straight line. 

6
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:33,549
Consequently, the absolute value function 
is not differentiable at 0. 

7
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:39,242
We can also see this from the limit 
definition of derivative. 

8
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:44,187
So we just going to name the absolute 
value function f, for the time being. 

9
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:48,401
What I am trying to calculate is the 
derivative of f at 0. 

10
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:52,135
I want to know is this function 
differentiable at 0. 

11
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,742
By the definition the derivative is the 
limit. 

12
00:00:55,742 --> 00:01:00,492
As h approaches 0, of the function, at |0 
+ h| - |0| / h. 

13
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:06,467
Now I can simplify that a bit. 
The absolute value of 0 + h, is just the 

14
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:12,717
absolute value of h, and the absolute 
value of 0, so I don't even need to 

15
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:15,538
subtract 0. 
And I"m dividing by h. 

16
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:20,587
Now what's the limit as it approaches 0 
of absolute value h/h. 

17
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:26,816
That limit doesn't exist and consequently 
this function's not differential at zero. 

18
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:32,243
If you wonder why that limit doesn't 
exist, well think back to our 2 sided 1 

19
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:38,862
sided limit discussion from before. 
What's the limit as h approaches 0 from 

20
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:46,267
the right-hand side of |h| / h? It's 1. 
Well what's the limit as h approaches 0 

21
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:50,417
from the left-hand side of |h| / h? It's 
-1. 

22
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:56,857
And 1 is not equal to -1. 
Because the one-sided limits disagree The 

23
00:01:56,857 --> 00:02:02,012
two sided limit doesn't exist. 
And this limit calculating the derivative 

24
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:05,782
means that this function is not 
differentiable at 0. 

25
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:11,017
Of course, that raises the question why 
should you care about differentiable 

26
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:15,292
functions at all? 
Here's some terrible looking function. 

27
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:21,603
But it's differentiable. 
So if I zoom in on some point, the thing 

28
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:27,839
looks like a straight line. 
Calculus is all about replacing the 

29
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:35,693
curved objects that we can't understand 
with straight lines, which we have some 

30
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:37,884
hope of understanding.
