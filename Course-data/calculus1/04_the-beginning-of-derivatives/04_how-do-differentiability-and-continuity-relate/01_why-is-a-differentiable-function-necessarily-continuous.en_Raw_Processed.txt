remember, continuity is nearby 
inputs sent to nearby outputs 
differentiability is wiggling 
input affects output 
in light this, seemed related, 
right 
something like following seems 
plausible 
heres theorem 
theorem 
if f is differentiable a, f is 
continuous a 
in words, a differentiable function 
is continuous 
morely, we know that a differentiable 
function is continuous 
advanced enough is point 
in course to give a precise argument 
using limit 
here we go 
lets suppose that f prime a exists 
in words, that means a certain 
limit exists 
limit well, limit 
fxfxxa x approaches a 
this limit a difference quotients 
computes derivative function 
a so, to say that derivative 
exists is to say that this limit exists 
now, here comes trick 
id like to compute is limit 
fxfa x approaches a, i dont 
know to that directly 
but, i rewrite this thing im taking 
limit a product 
watch 
instead taking this limit, im going 
to take limit x approaches a 
xa times this difference quotient, times 
fxfaxa 
now, long x isnt equal to a, this 
product is equal to this difference 
now, that help well, this is a 
limit a product 
so, one limit laws, limit 
a products product limits 
long limits exist 
in this case, 
so, this limit this product is, 
product limits 
limit xa x approaches a, 
times limit fxfaxa 
im allowed to use this limit law 
i know limits 
exist 
now, this first limit, limit xa 
x approaches a, thats 
this second limit, well, this limit 
exists precisely im assuming 
differentiability, 
functions differentiable 
so, this limit is calculating 
derivative a, zero times 
number is equal to zero 
upshot here is that weve shown that 
limit fxfa x approaches 
a 
would you care this 
that help us we know that limit 
fxfa x approaches a is equal to 
that means is that limit fx 
x approaches a is equal to fa, 
this is definition 
continuity 
so we know that f is continuous 
point a 
thats we ended 
remember, we started 
we started assuming that f 
differentiable a 
this work, we ended 
concluding that f is continuous 
point a 
so, differentiability implies continuity 
one way to keep track arguments like 
this is to think clouds rain 
theorem 
if is rainy, is cloudy 
a shorter way saying this, rainy 
implies cloudy 
question is, go 
way if cloudy, is necessarily 
rainy you think a cloudy day 
rain yes, today 
lets look window 
is cloudy theres rain 
beyond clouds rain, lets bring this 
back to mathematics a differentiable 
function is continuous, you think 
a continuous function isnt 
differentiable 
you might want to hit pause right now, 
if you dont want puzzle given away 
heres an example a function is 
continuous differential, 
function fxx 
we recently saw that absolute value 
function wasnt differentable zero 
we know that absolute 
value function is continuous everywhere 
we know that absolute value function 
is continuous 
i mean, look 
one piece 
but, we better 
we use limit knowledge to make a 
precise argument 
we know that fxx is continuous 
positive inputs 
continuous open interval 
zero to infinity function x 
is continuous there 
this function, absolute value 
function, agrees function x if i 
plug in positive numbers 
likewise, i know that function is 
continuous negative inputs 
function x is continuous there, 
function x agrees this function 
this interval 
sticking point is to check that 
functions continuous zero if 
i know continuous positive 
inputs, negative inputs, 
continuous zero, i know that 
continuous inputs 
now, i know that absolute 
value function is continuous zero 
well, thats another limit argument, 
right limit absolute value 
function i push righthand 
side is limit 
absolute value function i push 
lefthand side, theyre zero 
two onesided limits 
exist agree, i know 
twosided limit absolute value 
function is equal to zero, 
is also functions value 
zero 
therefore, abslute value function 
is continuous 
in end, theres relationship 
between differentiability continuity 
differentiable functions continuous
