Remember, continuity is all how nearby 

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:09,590
inputs are sent to nearby outputs. 
Differentiability is how wiggling the 

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,632
input affects the output. 
In light of this, they seemed related, 

4
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:18,002
right? 
Something like the following seems 

5
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,961
plausible. 
Here's the theorem. 

6
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,807
Theorem. 
If f is differentiable at a, then f is 

7
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:26,432
continuous at a. 
In other words, a differentiable function 

8
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:29,697
is continuous. 
Morely, we know that a differentiable 

9
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:33,255
function is continuous. 
But were advanced enough at the is point 

10
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,852
in the course to give a precise argument 
using limit. 

11
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:42,369
Here we go. 
Let's suppose that f prime of a exists. 

12
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:47,600
In other words, that means a certain 
limit exists. 

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,472
What limit? Well, the limit of 
f(x)-f(x)/x-a as x approaches a. 

14
00:00:55,472 --> 00:01:01,118
This limit of a difference quotients 
computes the derivative for the function 

15
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:06,509
at a. So, to say that the derivative 
exists is to say that this limit exists. 

16
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:11,177
Now, here comes the trick. 
What I'd like to compute is the limit of 

17
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:17,215
f(x)-f(a) as x approaches a, but I don't 
know how to do that directly. 

18
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:21,860
But, I can rewrite this thing I'm taking 
the limit of as a product. 

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,167
Watch. 
Instead of taking this limit, I'm going 

20
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:32,160
to take the limit as x approaches a of 
x-a times this difference quotient, times 

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,533
f(x)-f(a)/x-a. 
Now, as long as x isn't equal to a, this 

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:41,355
product is equal to this difference. 
Now, why does that help? Well, this is a 

23
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:44,766
limit of a product. 
So, by one of the limit laws, the limit 

24
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:49,099
of a product's the product of the limits 
as long as the limits exist. 

25
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,043
And in this case, they do. 
So, this limit of this product is, the 

26
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:57,952
product of the limits. 
It's the limit of x-a as x approaches a, 

27
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:04,452
times the limit of f(x)-f(a)/x-a. 
I'm only allowed to use this limit law 

28
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:08,177
because I know both of these limits 
exist. 

29
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:14,182
Now, this first limit, the limit of x-a 
as x approaches a, that's 0. 

30
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:19,653
And this second limit, well, this limit 
exists precisely because I'm assuming 

31
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:23,621
differentiability, 
the function's are differentiable. 

32
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:28,262
So, this limit is calculating the 
derivative at a, and zero times any 

33
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:32,762
number is equal to zero. 
The upshot here is that we've shown that 

34
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:37,240
the limit of f(x)-f(a)=0 as x approaches 
a. 

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,629
Why would you care about this? How does 
that help us? We know that the limit of 

36
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,993
f(x)-f(a) as x approaches a is equal to 
0. 

37
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:51,560
What that means is that the limit of f(x) 
as x approaches a is equal to f(a), but 

38
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,568
this is just the definition of 
continuity. 

39
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:58,202
So now we know that f is continuous at 
the point a. 

40
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:01,698
That's where we ended up. 
Remember, what we started with. 

41
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:05,033
We started by assuming that f was 
differentiable at a. 

42
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:09,946
And after doing all this work, we ended 
up concluding that f is continuous at the 

43
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:13,231
point a. 
So, differentiability implies continuity. 

44
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:18,062
One way to keep track of arguments like 
this is to think about clouds and rain. 

45
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:21,337
Theorem. 
If it is rainy, then it is cloudy. 

46
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:25,267
A shorter way of saying this, rainy 
implies cloudy. 

47
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:31,267
Now the question is, does it go the other 
way? If it's cloudy, is it necessarily 

48
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:35,942
rainy? Can you think of a cloudy day with 
no rain? Yes, today. 

49
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:40,467
Let's look out the window. 
It is very cloudy but there's no rain. 

50
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:45,577
Beyond clouds and rain, let's bring this 
back to the mathematics. A differentiable 

51
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:50,312
function is continuous, can you think of 
a continuous function which isn't 

52
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,932
differentiable? 
You might want to hit pause right now, 

53
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:58,804
if you don't want the puzzle given away. 
Here's an example of a function which is 

54
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,698
continuous but not differential, 
the function f(x)=|x|. 

55
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:08,596
We recently saw that the absolute value 
function wasn't differentable at zero. 

56
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:13,472
But how do we know that the absolute 
value function is continuous everywhere? 

57
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:16,918
We know that the absolute value function 
is continuous. 

58
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,097
I mean, look at it. 
It's all one piece. 

59
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:22,804
But, we can do better. 
We can use our limit knowledge to make a 

60
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,971
more precise argument. 
We know that f(x)=|x| is continuous for 

61
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,621
positive inputs. 
It's continuous on the open interval from 

62
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:35,160
zero to infinity because the function x 
is continuous there. 

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,048
And this function, the absolute value 
function, agrees with the function x if I 

64
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:44,052
plug in positive numbers. 
Likewise, I know that the function is 

65
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:49,397
continuous on negative inputs because the 
function -x is continuous there, and the 

66
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:52,937
function -x agrees with this function on 
this interval. 

67
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:57,887
The only sticking point is to check that 
the function's continuous at zero. And if 

68
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:02,342
I know it's continuous for positive 
inputs, negative inputs, and it's 

69
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:06,662
continuous at zero, then I know that it's 
continuous for all inputs. 

70
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:10,447
Now, how do I know that the absolute 
value function is continuous at zero? 

71
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:14,666
Well, that's another limit argument, 
right? The limit of the absolute value 

72
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,873
function when I push from the right-hand 
side is the same as the limit of the 

73
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:23,055
absolute value function when I push from 
the left-hand side, they're both zero. 

74
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,778
And because these two one-sided limits 
exist and agree, then I know the 

75
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:30,092
two-sided limit of the absolute value 
function is equal to zero, 

76
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,155
which is also the function's value at 
zero. 

77
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:37,508
And therefore, the abslute value function 
is continuous. 

78
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:43,717
In the end, there's some relationship 
between differentiability and continuity. 

79
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:49,840
Differentiable functions are continuous.

unrelated concepts.
