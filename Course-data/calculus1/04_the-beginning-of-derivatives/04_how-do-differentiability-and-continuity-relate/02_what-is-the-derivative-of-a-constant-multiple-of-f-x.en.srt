00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,978
[MUSIC] Here is the question that I want 
to address right now. 

2
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:11,243
What's the derivative of some constant 
multiple of some function? Now, in this 

3
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:17,852
case the constant multiple is 2 but of 
course that 2 could be replaced by any 

4
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,252
sixth number. 
If you don't like the D D X notation, 

5
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:26,477
another way to ask this question is this. 
If you've got some new function G and 

6
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:32,027
it's the constant multiple times F, again 
in this case I'm using 2 as the constant, 

7
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:37,232
the question is, what's the derivative of 
G in terms of the derivative of F? 

8
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:42,183
To gain some intuition, let's pick a 
specific example, and look at a graph. 

9
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:45,622
So here's the graph, of, just some random 
function. 

10
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:49,597
Let's suppose that I stretch this graph, 
in the y direction. 

11
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:54,644
So now I stretch the y axis, and that 
corresponds to multiplying the function 

12
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,302
by a constant value. 
In this case, to, 

13
00:00:57,302 --> 00:01:02,666
how do the tangent lines change when I do 
this stretching? So if I double the Y 

14
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:07,565
axis, the function changes by twice as 
much for the same input change. 

15
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:12,851
So if I double the Y axis, the slope of 
the tangent line also doubles and that 

16
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,045
makes sense numerically. 
Here's what I know. 

17
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:20,341
I know that g of x is twice f of x. 
G is this constant multiple of f. 

18
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,511
I also know something about the 
derivative of f. 

19
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:28,704
The derivative encodes how input changes 
become output changes, or, a bit more 

20
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:33,751
precisely, the derivative in the limit is 
the ratio of output change to input 

21
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,135
change. 
So if I multiply the ratio of output 

22
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:43,339
change to input change by an actual input 
change, this at least approximately is 

23
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:49,009
telling me how much the output should 
change when I move from x to x plus h. 

24
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,382
Right, f's new output at the input x plus 
h. 

25
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:57,067
Is it's old output plus how much I expect 
the output to change. 

26
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:02,237
This is a really nice way to summarize 
what the derivative's saying. 

27
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:06,682
I know another thing. 
I know that g of x plus h is twice f of x 

28
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:12,377
plus h just because g is twice f for any 
input value x, so in particular that's 

29
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:17,927
true when the input is x plus h. 
These two statements are connected. 

30
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:24,177
Alright, G of X plus H is twice F of X 
plus H and F of X plus H is approximately 

31
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,822
this. 
So I can combine those two statements 

32
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:33,748
together in this statement. 
G of X plus H is about twice f(x)+h is 

33
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:42,846
approximate value, right. 
2f(x)+2h*f-prime(x), which I've written 

34
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:49,248
as h*2f-prime(x). 
I made this a little bit nicer. 

35
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:55,308
Since 2f(x) is g(x), 
I can replace this 2*f(x), with g(x). 

36
00:02:55,308 --> 00:03:02,178
And this is really looking good. 
This is telling me that g's output at x+h 

37
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:08,966
is about, g's output at x, plus how much 
I change the input by, times some 

38
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,336
quantity. 
Now, considering that the actual 

39
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:16,115
derivative of g would tell me some 
information like this. 

40
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:20,872
That g's output is about, g's old output 
plus how much I change the input by times 

41
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:24,553
the derivative. 
You're beginning to see what's going on 

42
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:28,115
here, right? Look, I've got the 
derivative of g here. 

43
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:31,012
And I've got twice the derivative of f 
here. 

44
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:36,677
And if you sort of believe that these 
statements are connected in this way, you 

45
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:41,912
might then believe that the derivative of 
g is twice the derivative of f. 

46
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,776
The derivative of g here is twice the 
derivative of f. 

47
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:51,708
We can formalize this as a rule. 
Here's the constant multiple rule. 

48
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:56,619
So let k be constant and suppose that f 
is just some function which is 

49
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:01,742
differentiable at the point a. 
G is that constant multiple of f, so g of 

50
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,382
x is k*f(x). 
Given this setup, what the constant 

51
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:11,542
multiple rule is concluding, is that the 
derivatives are related in the same way. 

52
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:17,212
The derivative at the point A is K times 
the derivative of F at the point A. 

53
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:23,230
Now if you don't like this prime notation 
you could also write it using the D D X 

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,674
notation. 
So here's how I write the constant 

55
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:33,591
multiple law using the D D X notation. 
The derivative of k times a function is k 

56
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:41,375
times the derivative of that function. 
I encourage you to keep practicing. 

57
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:50,091
With time, you'll be able to calculate 
the derivative of just a ton of different 

58
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,296
functions.
