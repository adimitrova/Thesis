music here is question that i want 
to address right 
whats derivative constant 
multiple function now, in this 
case constant multiple is 
course that could replaced 
sixth number 
if you dont like d d x notation, 
another way to ask this question is this 
if youve got new function g 
constant multiple times f, 
in this case im using constant, 
question is, whats derivative 
g in terms derivative f 
to gain intuition, lets pick a 
specific example, look a graph 
so heres graph, of, random 
function 
lets suppose that i stretch this graph, 
in y direction 
so i stretch y axis, that 
corresponds to multiplying function 
a constant value 
in this case, to, 
tangent lines change i 
this stretching so if i double y 
axis, function changes twice 
much input change 
so if i double y axis, slope 
tangent line also doubles that 
makes sense numerically 
heres i know 
i know that g x is twice f x 
g is this constant multiple f 
i also know something 
derivative f 
derivative encodes input changes 
become output changes, or, a bit 
precisely, derivative in limit is 
ratio output change to input 
change 
so if i multiply ratio output 
change to input change an actual input 
change, this least approximately is 
telling much output 
change i move x to x plus h 
right, fs new output input x plus 
h 
is old output plus much i expect 
output to change 
this is a really nice way to summarize 
derivatives saying 
i know another thing 
i know that g x plus h is twice f x 
plus h g is twice f 
input value x, so in particular thats 
true input is x plus h 
two statements connected 
alright, g x plus h is twice f x 
plus h f x plus h is approximately 
this 
so i combine two statements 
together in this statement 
g x plus h is twice fxh is 
approximate value, right 
fxhfprimex, ive written 
hfprimex 
i made this a little bit nicer 
since fx is gx, 
i replace this fx, gx 
this is really looking good 
this is telling that gs output xh 
is about, gs output x, plus much 
i change input by, times 
quantity 
now, considering that actual 
derivative g would tell 
information like this 
that gs output is about, gs old output 
plus much i change input times 
derivative 
youre beginning to see whats going 
here, right look, ive got 
derivative g here 
ive got twice derivative f 
here 
if you sort believe that 
statements connected in this way, you 
might believe that derivative 
g is twice derivative f 
derivative g here is twice 
derivative f 
we formalize this a rule 
heres constant multiple rule 
so let k constant suppose that f 
is function is 
differentiable point a 
g is that constant multiple f, so g 
x is kfx 
given this setup, constant 
multiple rule is concluding, is that 
derivatives related in way 
derivative point a is k times 
derivative f point a 
if you dont like this prime notation 
you could also write using d d x 
notation 
so heres i write constant 
multiple law using d d x notation 
derivative k times a function is k 
times derivative that function 
i encourage you to keep practicing 
time, youll able to calculate 
derivative a ton different 
functions
