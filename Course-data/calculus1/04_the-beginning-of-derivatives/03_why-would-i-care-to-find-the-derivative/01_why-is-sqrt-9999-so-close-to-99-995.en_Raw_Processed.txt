music sometime in future, 
going to see following derivative 
rule 
but, i want to mention so we 
see an example derivatives 
play in practice 
derivative x is x 
you might already believe this if you 
believe power rule, 
right 
derivative xn is nxn so, if n 
is , ive got that derivative 
xn, , is n, , times xn 
conveniently, 
this is really this, 
written here square root 
symbol instead exponents 
we use this derivative rule to help 
explain certain numerological 
coincidences 
lets take a look 
look, is , okay, so 
keeps going forever 
irrational 
but, this is bizarrely close to 
instead saying close to 
is this a coincidence this isnt a 
coincidence 
look 
square is is 
im really here is wiggling 
input 
im going , to , 
in words, im trying to calculate 
, wiggling input a 
bit 
derivative calculate well, 
derivative calculates ratio 
between output change to input change 
so, wiggled a little bit 
is minus much i 
change input times ratio 
much i expect output change 
compared to input change 
now, we try to calculate 
derivative , 
whats derivative , well, 

is , so 
is , is 
look, is so close to 
is 
and, i shift input one, 
this derivative calculation is suggesting 
that output shifted 
, indeed is 
this is a great example calculus 
yes, you could asked calculator 
to compute , you couldnt 
asked calculator to tell you 
is that answer so mysteriously 
close to 
in short, calculus is 
calculating 
answers, 
reasons explanations 
stories that human beings tell to 
that number 
another 
but, thats say that numbers 
arent fun to play themselves, 
we use this trick to 
amazing feats like , we try to 
estimate 
i know is 
im trying to say something 
im trying to wiggle input a 
little bit 
well, derivatives something to say 
that 
, , would 
, is , plus much i expect 
output to change 
i wiggled input, 
i expect output to change 
amount 
well, derivative is measuring 
much i expect output to change 
so, im going to take derivative 
function , square root 
function , im going to multiply 
much im wiggling input this 
will much i expect output to 
change i change input 
now, in this specific case, whats 
derivative well, thats , 
is is , is 
so, i would expect to 
i expect wiggling 
input to wiggle output 

this is pretty good 
theres actually two different ways to 
tell if this isnt a bad guess 
heres heres one way to tell 
whats whats well, 
repeating 
and, whats actual value 

look, pretty close to plus this 
thats pretty good 
another way to see that this isnt a 
bad guess is to take , 
square 
i square , i get 
this is , is 
small number 
so, either way you look it, 
pretty good to guess is 
this, 
derivatives 
again, derivatives win 
relating input change to 
output change, able to estimate 
values functions that would 
hard to access directly
