00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,143
[MUSIC] Sometime in the future, we're 
going to see the following derivative 

2
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:09,561
rule. 
But, I want to mention it now just so we 

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:14,565
can see an example of how derivatives 
play out in practice. 

4
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:24,195
The derivative of the √x is 1/2√x. 
You might already believe this if you 

5
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,394
believe the power rule, 
right? 

6
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:35,396
The derivative of x^n is nx^n-1. So, if n 
is 1/2, then I've got that the derivative 

7
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:42,172
of x^n, now 1/2, is n, 1/2, times x^n-1. 
And conveniently, 1/2-1=-1/2. 

8
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:49,082
This is really the same as this, it's 
just written here with the square root 

9
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:56,177
symbol instead of with the exponents. 
We can use this derivative rule to help 

10
00:00:56,177 --> 00:01:00,502
explain certain numerological 
coincidences. 

11
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:08,194
Let's take a look. 
Look, the √9999 is 99.9949998, okay, so 

12
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:13,374
it keeps on going forever. 
It's irrational. 

13
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:22,758
But, this is bizarrely close to 99.99 
instead of 499 just saying it's close to 

14
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:27,246
99.995. 
Is this just a coincidence? This isn't a 

15
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,553
coincidence. 
Look. 

16
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:32,215
The square √10000 is 100 because 100^2 is 
10,000. 

17
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,376
What I'm really doing here is wiggling 
the input. 

18
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:39,940
I'm going from 10,000 to 9,999. 
In other words, I'm trying to calculate 

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,027
the √10000-1, wiggling the input down a 
bit. 

20
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:49,343
What does the derivative calculate? Well, 
the derivative calculates the ratio 

21
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:55,645
between output change to input change. 
So, the √10000 wiggled down a little bit 

22
00:01:55,645 --> 00:02:01,339
is about the √10000 minus how much I 
change the input by times the ratio of 

23
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:06,052
how much I expect the output change 
compared to the input change. 

24
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:09,803
Now, we can try to calculate the 
derivative at 10,000. 

25
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:13,043
What's the derivative at 10,000? Well, 
it's 1/2√10000. 

26
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:22,587
The √10000 is 100, so it's 1/2*100. 
1/2*100 is 1/200, which is 0.005. 

27
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:30,072
Look, the √9999 is so close to 99.995 
because the √10000 is 100. 

28
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:36,585
And, when I shift the input down by one, 
this derivative calculation is suggesting 

29
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:42,492
that the output should be shifted down by 
about 0.005, and indeed it is. 

30
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:48,371
This is a great example of calculus. 
Yes, you could have asked your calculator 

31
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:55,246
to compute the √9999, but you couldn't 
have asked your calculator to tell you 

32
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:59,815
why. Why is that answer so mysteriously 
close to 99.995? 

33
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,912
In short, calculus is more than 
calculating. 

34
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:07,080
It's not about answers, it's about 
reasons. It's about explanations about 

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,567
the stories that human beings can tell to 
each other about why that number and not 

36
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,049
another. 
But, that's not say that the numbers 

37
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,231
aren't fun to play with themselves, and 
we can use this same trick to do other 

38
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,992
amazing feats like · , we can try to 
estimate the √82. 

39
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:26,236
I know the √81 is 9. 
I'm trying to say something about the 

40
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:29,442
√82. 
I'm trying to wiggle the input up a 

41
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,640
little bit. 
Well, derivatives have something to say 

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,495
about that. 
The √81+1, the √82, would be about the 

43
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:41,806
√81, which is 9, plus how much I expect 
the output to change. 

44
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:45,280
I wiggled the input, 
I expect the output to change by some 

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,091
amount. 
Well, the derivative is measuring how 

46
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:52,794
much I expect the output to change by. 
So, I'm going to take the derivative of 

47
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:57,014
the function at 81, at the square root 
function at 81, I'm going to multiply by 

48
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:01,880
how much I'm wiggling the input by. This 
will be how much I expect the output to 

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,188
change when I change the input. 
Now, in this specific case, what's the 

50
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:14,652
derivative at 81? Well, that's 1/2√81, 
which is 1/2*9. The √81 is 9, which is 

51
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:23,572
1/18. So, I would expect the √82 to be 
about 9+1/18 because I expect wiggling 

52
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:27,962
the input up to wiggle the output up by 
about 1/18. 

53
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:33,439
And this is pretty good. 
There's actually two different ways to 

54
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,326
tell if this isn't such a bad guess. 
Here's here's one way to tell. 

55
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,628
What's what's 1/18? Well, it's 0.05 
repeating. 

56
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:45,901
And, what's the actual value of the √82? 
It's 9.055. 

57
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:51,119
Look, it's pretty close to 9 plus this. 
That's pretty good. 

58
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:59,096
Another way to see that this isn't such a 
bad guess is just to take 9+1/18, and 

59
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:03,147
square it. 
When I square 9+1/18, I get 

60
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,759
9^2+2*9/18+1/1/8^2. 
2*1/2=1. 

61
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:12,530
This is 81+1=82, and 1/18^2 is the very 
small number 1/324. 

62
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:20,413
So, either way you look at it, we're 
doing pretty good to guess the √82 is 

63
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:25,094
about this, 
and we're doing it with derivatives. 

64
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:31,889
Again, it's derivatives for the win. 
By relating the input change to the 

65
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:39,433
output change, we're able to estimate the 
values of functions that would be very 

66
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,567
hard to access directly.
