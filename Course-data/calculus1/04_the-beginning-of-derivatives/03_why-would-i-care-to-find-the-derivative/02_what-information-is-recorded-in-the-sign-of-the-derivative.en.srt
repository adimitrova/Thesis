00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,669
[MUSIC] In the future, we're going to 
have a lot of very precise statements 

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:11,749
about the derivative. But before we get 
there, I want us to have some intuition 

3
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:16,089
as to what's going on. 
Let's take a look at just the S, I, G, N, 

4
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:20,745
the sign of the derivative. 
The thick green line of the plot is some 

5
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:25,724
random function, and the thin red line is 
its derivative. And note that when its 

6
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:30,672
derivative is positive, the function's 
increasing, and when the derivative is 

7
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:35,576
negative, the function's decreasing. 
We can try to explain what we're seeing 

8
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:38,662
here formally, where that calculation on 
paper. 

9
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:43,044
So let's suppose that the derivative is 
positive over a whole range of values. 

10
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:47,552
And, we also know something about how the 
derivative is related to the functions 

11
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:50,561
values. 
The function's output or x+h is close to 

12
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:55,157
the functions output of x plus how much 
the derivative tells us the output should 

13
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:59,438
change by, which is how the input changed 
by times the ratio change of output 

14
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:05,337
change to input change. 
Alright. Now let's suppose that x+h is a 

15
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:11,922
bit bigger than than x. 
Well, what that's really saying is that h 

16
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:17,417
is positive, right? 
I shift the input to the right a little 

17
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:20,882
bit. 
Well then, h*f'(x) is going to be 

18
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:27,122
positive because a positive number times 
a positive number is positive. 

19
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:32,177
And that means that f(x)+h*f'(x) will be 
bigger than f(x). 

20
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:36,612
We're just add something to both sides of 
this inequality. 

21
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:44,095
Now, f(x)+h*f'(x), that's about f(x)+h. 
So, although this argument isn't entirely 

22
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:50,266
precise yet, what it looks like it's 
saying is that the function's output at 

23
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,062
x+h is bigger than the function's output 
at x. 

24
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:58,622
So, if you plug in bigger inputs, you get 
bigger outputs. 

25
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:02,300
What about when the derivative is 
negative? 

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,820
We can play the same kind of game when 
the derivative's negative. 

27
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,218
Here we go. So again, x+h is just a bit 
bigger than x. 

28
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:17,506
And in that case, h is positive. 
But I've got a positive number times a 

29
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:22,867
negative number, h times the derivative 
of f is negative. 

30
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:27,942
Now, if I add f(x) to both sides, 
got that f(x)+h*f'(x) is less than f(x). 

31
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:40,312
But this is approximately the new output 
value of the function at x+h. 

32
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:45,502
So, I've got that the function's output 
at x+h is a little bit less than its 

33
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,908
output at f. 
So, a bigger input is giving rise to a 

34
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:53,054
smaller output. 
Even a little bit of information, whether 

35
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:58,119
or not the derivative is positive or 
negative, says something about the 

36
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:01,147
function. 
And you can see the same thing in your 

37
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,301
own life. 
For instance, suppose that the derivative 

38
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,389
of your happiness with respect to coffee 
is positive. 

39
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,013
What does that really mean? Well, that 
means that you should be drinking more 

40
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:16,141
coffee because an increase in coffee will 
lead to greater happiness. 

41
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:18,677
Of course, this is only true up to a 
point. 

42
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:22,977
After you've had a whole bunch of coffee, 
you might find that the derivative of 

43
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,532
your happiness, with respect to coffee, 
is zero. 

44
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:29,302
You should stop drinking coffee. 
Now, this makes sense because the 

45
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:33,602
derivative depends upon x, right? It 
depends upon how much coffee you've had. 

46
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:37,757
Not very much coffee, the derivative 
might be positive. But after a certain 

47
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:40,792
point, you might find that the 
derivative, vanishes. 

48
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:44,351
This seems like a silly example. 
coffee and happiness. 

49
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,043
But, so many things in our world are 
changing. 

50
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:49,883
And those changing things affect other 
things. 

51
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:54,548
The question is that when one of those 
things changes, does the other thing move 

52
00:03:54,548 --> 00:04:00,853
in the same direction or do they move in 
opposite directions? And the sign, the S, 

53
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:10,851
I, G, N of the derivative records exactly 
that information. 

54
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,355
