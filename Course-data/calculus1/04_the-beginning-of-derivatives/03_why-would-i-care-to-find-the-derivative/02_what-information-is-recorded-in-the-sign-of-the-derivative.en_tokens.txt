in
the
future
,
we
're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
very
precise
statements
about
the
derivative
.
but
before
we
get
there
,
i
want
us
to
have
some
intuition
as
to
what
's
going
on
.
let
's
take
a
look
at
just
the
s
,
i
,
g
,
n
,
the
sign
of
the
derivative
.
the
thick
green
line
of
the
plot
is
some
random
function
,
and
the
thin
red
line
is
its
derivative
.
and
note
that
when
its
derivative
is
positive
,
the
function
's
increasing
,
and
when
the
derivative
is
negative
,
the
function
's
decreasing
.
we
can
try
to
explain
what
we
're
seeing
here
formally
,
where
that
calculation
on
paper
.
so
let
's
suppose
that
the
derivative
is
positive
over
a
whole
range
of
values
.
and
,
we
also
know
something
about
how
the
derivative
is
related
to
the
functions
values
.
the
function
's
output
or
x+h
is
close
to
the
functions
output
of
x
plus
how
much
the
derivative
tells
us
the
output
should
change
by
,
which
is
how
the
input
changed
by
times
the
ratio
change
of
output
change
to
input
change
.
alright
.
now
let
's
suppose
that
x+h
is
a
bit
bigger
than
than
x.
well
,
what
that
's
really
saying
is
that
h
is
positive
,
right
?
i
shift
the
input
to
the
right
a
little
bit
.
well
then
,
h*f
'
(
x
)
is
going
to
be
positive
because
a
positive
number
times
a
positive
number
is
positive
.
and
that
means
that
f
(
x
)
+h*f
'
(
x
)
will
be
bigger
than
f
(
x
)
.
we
're
just
add
something
to
both
sides
of
this
inequality
.
now
,
f
(
x
)
+h*f
'
(
x
)
,
that
's
about
f
(
x
)
+h
.
so
,
although
this
argument
is
n't
entirely
precise
yet
,
what
it
looks
like
it
's
saying
is
that
the
function
's
output
at
x+h
is
bigger
than
the
function
's
output
at
x.
so
,
if
you
plug
in
bigger
inputs
,
you
get
bigger
outputs
.
what
about
when
the
derivative
is
negative
?
we
can
play
the
same
kind
of
game
when
the
derivative
's
negative
.
here
we
go
.
so
again
,
x+h
is
just
a
bit
bigger
than
x.
and
in
that
case
,
h
is
positive
.
but
i
've
got
a
positive
number
times
a
negative
number
,
h
times
the
derivative
of
f
is
negative
.
now
,
if
i
add
f
(
x
)
to
both
sides
,
got
that
f
(
x
)
+h*f
'
(
x
)
is
less
than
f
(
x
)
.
but
this
is
approximately
the
new
output
value
of
the
function
at
x+h
.
so
,
i
've
got
that
the
function
's
output
at
x+h
is
a
little
bit
less
than
its
output
at
f.
so
,
a
bigger
input
is
giving
rise
to
a
smaller
output
.
even
a
little
bit
of
information
,
whether
or
not
the
derivative
is
positive
or
negative
,
says
something
about
the
function
.
and
you
can
see
the
same
thing
in
your
own
life
.
for
instance
,
suppose
that
the
derivative
of
your
happiness
with
respect
to
coffee
is
positive
.
what
does
that
really
mean
?
well
,
that
means
that
you
should
be
drinking
more
coffee
because
an
increase
in
coffee
will
lead
to
greater
happiness
.
of
course
,
this
is
only
true
up
to
a
point
.
after
you
've
had
a
whole
bunch
of
coffee
,
you
might
find
that
the
derivative
of
your
happiness
,
with
respect
to
coffee
,
is
zero
.
you
should
stop
drinking
coffee
.
now
,
this
makes
sense
because
the
derivative
depends
upon
x
,
right
?
it
depends
upon
how
much
coffee
you
've
had
.
not
very
much
coffee
,
the
derivative
might
be
positive
.
but
after
a
certain
point
,
you
might
find
that
the
derivative
,
vanishes
.
this
seems
like
a
silly
example
.
coffee
and
happiness
.
but
,
so
many
things
in
our
world
are
changing
.
and
those
changing
things
affect
other
things
.
the
question
is
that
when
one
of
those
things
changes
,
does
the
other
thing
move
in
the
same
direction
or
do
they
move
in
opposite
directions
?
and
the
sign
,
the
s
,
i
,
g
,
n
of
the
derivative
records
exactly
that
information
.
