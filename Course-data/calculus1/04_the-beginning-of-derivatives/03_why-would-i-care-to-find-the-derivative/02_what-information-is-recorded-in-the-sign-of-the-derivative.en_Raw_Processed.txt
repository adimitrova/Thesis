music in future, going to 
a lot precise statements 
derivative we get 
there, i want us to intuition 
to whats going 
lets take a look s, i, g, n, 
sign derivative 
thick green line plot is 
random function, thin red line is 
derivative note that 
derivative is positive, functions 
increasing, derivative is 
negative, functions decreasing 
we try to explain seeing 
here formally, that calculation 
paper 
so lets suppose that derivative is 
positive a whole range values 
and, we also know something 
derivative is related to functions 
values 
functions output xh is close to 
functions output x plus much 
derivative tells us output 
change by, is input changed 
times ratio change output 
change to input change 
alright lets suppose that xh is a 
bit bigger x 
well, thats really saying is that h 
is positive, right 
i shift input to right a little 
bit 
well then, hfx is going to 
positive a positive number times 
a positive number is positive 
that means that fxhfx will 
bigger fx 
add something to sides 
this inequality 
now, fxhfx, thats fxh 
so, although this argument isnt entirely 
precise yet, looks like 
saying is that functions output 
xh is bigger functions output 
x 
so, if you plug in bigger inputs, you get 
bigger outputs 
derivative is 
negative 
we play kind game 
derivatives negative 
here we go so again, xh is a bit 
bigger x 
in that case, h is positive 
ive got a positive number times a 
negative number, h times derivative 
f is negative 
now, if i add fx to sides, 
got that fxhfx is less fx 
this is approximately new output 
value function xh 
so, ive got that functions output 
xh is a little bit less 
output f 
so, a bigger input is giving rise to a 
smaller output 
even a little bit information, whether 
derivative is positive 
negative, says something 
function 
you see thing in 
life 
instance, suppose that derivative 
happiness respect to coffee 
is positive 
that really mean well, that 
means that you drinking 
coffee an increase in coffee will 
lead to greater happiness 
course, this is true to a 
point 
youve a whole bunch coffee, 
you might find that derivative 
happiness, respect to coffee, 
is zero 
you stop drinking coffee 
now, this makes sense 
derivative depends upon x, right 
depends upon much coffee youve 
much coffee, derivative 
might positive a certain 
point, you might find that 
derivative, vanishes 
this seems like a silly example 
coffee happiness 
but, so many things in world 
changing 
changing things affect 
things 
question is that one 
things changes, thing move 
in direction move in 
opposite directions sign, s, 
i, g, n derivative records exactly 
that information 
music
