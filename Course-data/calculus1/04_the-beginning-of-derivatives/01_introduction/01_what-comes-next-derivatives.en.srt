00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:08,706
A major theme in calculus is change.

3
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:12,367
You've got one thing affecting something
else, you want to

4
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:16,330
know, how does changing this one thing
affect this other thing.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,370
Often the relationship between these two
things is given by a function, right?

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,460
You've got some kind of function that has
inputs and outputs.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,610
And you're wiggling that input point, and
you

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,120
want to know how the output value view
changes.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,820
Very concretely.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,740
You might ask for the ratio of change in
the output valve view to

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,040
change in the input point and that ratio,
that's the derivative.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,490
Alright.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,065
Derivatives measure how change in the
import affects the out port.

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,293
At least infinitesimally.

15
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:55,840
And studying derivatives is exactly what
we're going to do now.
