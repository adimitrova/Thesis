a
major
theme
in
calculus
is
change
.
you
've
got
one
thing
affecting
something
else
,
you
want
to
know
,
how
does
changing
this
one
thing
affect
this
other
thing
.
often
the
relationship
between
these
two
things
is
given
by
a
function
,
right
?
you
've
got
some
kind
of
function
that
has
inputs
and
outputs
.
and
you
're
wiggling
that
input
point
,
and
you
want
to
know
how
the
output
value
view
changes
.
very
concretely
.
you
might
ask
for
the
ratio
of
change
in
the
output
valve
view
to
change
in
the
input
point
and
that
ratio
,
that
's
the
derivative
.
alright
.
derivatives
measure
how
change
in
the
import
affects
the
out
port
.
at
least
infinitesimally
.
and
studying
derivatives
is
exactly
what
we
're
going
to
do
now
.
