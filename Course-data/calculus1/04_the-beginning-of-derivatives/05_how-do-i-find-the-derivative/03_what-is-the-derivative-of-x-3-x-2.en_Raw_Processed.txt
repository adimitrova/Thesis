music 
youve heard the, ask 
country you, you 
country rule 
chiastic rules limits 
limits sum limits 
thing is true derivatives 
lets go to board 
heres rule derivatives 
derivative f g 
is derivative f derivative 
g 
in short, derivative sum is 
sum derivatives 
this make sense well, think 
back to derivative is measuring 
derivative is measuring changing 
input affects output 
in this case, i want to know changing 
x affects sum f x g x 
well, sum is affected sum 
effects 
sum derivative f 
derivative g 
let see this in a specific case 
heres a specific case 
function fx x x 
lets differentiate this 
im going to calculate d dx 
xx 
this is a derivative a sum, 
is sum derivatives 
we to figure whats 
derivative x whats 
derivative x 
thats power law 
derivative x is x, 
derivative x is x 
theres ddxs 
weve calculated derivative 
derivative xxx 
we know this, we figure 
derivative is positive 
negative 
so, derivative xx i want 
to know thats positive 
negative, values x make that 
bigger , values x make 
that less 
one approach to thinking this is to 
factor xx 
i write that xx 
i factor like this i 
figure sign this figuring 
sign two terms 
separately 
visualize this a direct whole number 
line 
so x, heres a number line 
x is positive is bigger 
negative x is less 
thats complicated 
well look x 
well, x, i draw a number line 
that 
exciting point is 
x is less , x is 
negative 
x is bigger s, 
x 
is positive 
now, i really dont care x x 
separately 
i want to put together right 
i want to know product is 
positive negative 
so, i write product x x 
make a new number line here 
ill record points 
i think happens 
x is less x is 
negative x is negative 
so product is a negative a 
negative, is positive 
x is between , x is 
negative x is positive a 
negative times a positive number is 
negative 
finally, x is bigger , 
well x is positive also x is 
positive 
so is positive 
so, here this number line, ive 
recorded information x 
x is positive negative 
we use this information to say 
something graph 
heres graph function xx 
goes up, up, thats exactly 
youd expect derivative, 
right we calculated that if 
youre standing to left s, 
derivative positive, 
indeed functions going 

you get to , derivative 
is here, between 
derivative is negative indeed 
graph is moving until you get to 
derivative this function is 
positive graph is going 
look, sign derivative 
positive, negative, positive is reflected 
in direction that this graph is 
moving 
increasing, decreasing, increasing 
incredible 
able to differentiate xx, 
able to gain real insight 
graph function 
plotting a whole bunch 
points hoping that we fill in 
a straight line 
looking derivative, we know 
that function is increasing 
decreasing 
able to say something, sure
