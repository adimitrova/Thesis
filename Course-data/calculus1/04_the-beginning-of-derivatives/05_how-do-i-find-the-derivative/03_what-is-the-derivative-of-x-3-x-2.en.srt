[MUSIC]. 
You've heard of the, ask not what your 

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:08,139
country can do for you, but what you can 
do for your country rule. 

3
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:13,187
These chiastic rules for limits. 
The limit's the sum of the limits. 

4
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:17,400
Same thing is true for derivatives. 
Let's go to the board. 

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,772
Here's the rule for derivatives. 
The derivative of f + g. 

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,963
Is the derivative of f + the derivative 
of g. 

7
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:29,712
In short, the derivative of the sum is 
the sum of the derivatives. 

8
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:35,522
Why does this make sense? Well, think 
back to what the derivative is measuring. 

9
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:41,162
The derivative is measuring how changing 
the input affects the output. 

10
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:47,166
In this case, I want to know how changing 
x affects the sum of f of x and g of x. 

11
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:51,229
Well, the sum is affected by the sum of 
the effects. 

12
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,622
The sum of the derivative of f and the 
derivative of g. 

13
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:00,860
Let' see this in a specific case. 
Here's a specific case. 

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,148
The function f(x) = x^3 + x^2. 
Let's differentiate this. 

15
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,703
I'm going to calculate d / dx 
(x^3+3=x^2). 

16
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:15,812
Now this is a derivative of a sum, which 
is the sum of derivatives. 

17
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:21,476
Now we have to figure out what's the 
derivative of x ^ 3 and what's the 

18
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:25,254
derivative of x^2. 
That's the power law. 

19
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:30,266
derivative of x^3 is 3x^2, 
and the derivative of x^2 is 2x. 

20
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:35,736
And now there's no more d/dx's. 
We've calculated the derivative. 

21
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:41,491
The derivative of x^3+x^2+2x. 
Once we know this, we can figure out 

22
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:45,318
where the derivative is positive and 
where it's negative. 

23
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:50,659
So, the derivative was 3x^3+2x and I want 
to know where that's positive and 

24
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,537
negative, which values of x make that 
bigger than 0, which values of x make 

25
00:01:55,537 --> 00:02:00,785
that less than 0. 
one approach to thinking about this is to 

26
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:05,666
factor through the x^2+2x. 
I can write that as x(3x+2). 

27
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:12,031
And once I factor it like this I can 
figure out the SIGN of this by figuring 

28
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,872
out the SIGN of these two terms 
separately. 

29
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:19,673
visualize this as a direct whole number 
line. 

30
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:24,570
So x, here's a number line. 
X is positive when it is bigger than 0 

31
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,392
and negative when X is less than 0. 
That's not too complicated. 

32
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:33,909
Well look 3x+2. 
Well, 3x+2, I draw a number line for 

33
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,691
that. 
The exciting point is -2/3. 

34
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,671
When x is less than -2/3, 3x+2 is 
negative. 

35
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:47,852
And when x is bigger than -2/3's, then 
3x+2. 

36
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:51,255
Is positive. 
Now, I really don't care about x and 3x+2 

37
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,274
separately. 
I want to put them together right. 

38
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,886
I want to know when their product is 
positive or negative. 

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,142
So, I write down the product x * 3x+2 
make a new number line here. 

40
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:08,027
I'll record both of these points -2/3 and 
0 then I can think about what happens. 

41
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:12,820
When x is less than -2/3 then x is 
negative and 3x+2 is negative. 

42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,452
So the product is a negative * a 
negative, which is positive. 

43
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:23,734
When x is between -2/3 and 0, then x is 
negative but 3x+2 is positive and a 

44
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:27,756
negative times a positive number is 
negative. 

45
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:34,357
And finally, when x is bigger than 0, 
well then x is positive and also 3x+2 is 

46
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:36,841
positive. 
So the Is positive. 

47
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:42,508
So, here on this number line, I've 
recorded the information about when 3x^2 

48
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:47,503
+ 2x is positive or negative. 
Now we can use this information to say 

49
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:52,772
something about the graph. 
Here's the graph of the function x^3+x^2. 

50
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:58,081
Goes up, down and up, And that's exactly 
what you'd expect from the derivative, 

51
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:03,069
right? We calculated before that if 
you're standing to the left of - 2/3's, 

52
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,732
then the derivative was positive, and 
indeed the functions going up. 

53
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:11,319
Up. 
Now once you get to -2/3, the derivative 

54
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,816
is 0 but then over here, between -2/3 and 
0 the derivative is negative and indeed 

55
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:24,405
the graph is moving down until you get to 
0 when the derivative of this function is 

56
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:30,512
positive again and the graph is going up. 
Look, the sign of the derivative 

57
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:35,218
Positive, negative, positive is reflected 
in the direction that this graph is 

58
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,058
moving. 
Increasing, decreasing, increasing. 

59
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:41,303
Incredible. 
By being able to differentiate x^2+x^3, 

60
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:45,060
we're able to gain real insight into the 
graph of the function. 

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,775
We're not just plotting a whole bunch of 
points and hoping that we can fill it in 

62
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:55,655
with a straight line. 
By looking at the derivative, we know 

63
00:04:55,655 --> 00:05:01,308
that the function is increasing and 
decreasing. 

64
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:06,733
We're able to say something, for sure.
