looks like ive got two functions fx 
gx, theyre differentiable 
a 
i define a new function 
hx is sum f g 
alright a new function, to compute 
hx i plug x f i plug x 
g i add together whatever f 
g give 
alright so thats a new function that i 
build f g 
heres conclusion, right 
prime a is sum 
derivative f a derivative 
g a 
to prove something like this, this is 
a really a theorem, right this is a 
theorem that tells to compute 
derivative sum functions 
i prove something like this 
i go back to definition 
derivative 
alright 
derivative this function h 
point a is limit x goes to a of, 
hxhaxa 
i know hx is 
hx is fx gx 
so i plug that in 
alright, so this is limit x goes 
to a fxgx 
i also know ha is, right i 
plug in a x 
i get that ha is faga 
this is divided 
denominator, xa 
great 
i want to calculate that limit, right 
well, i rearrange numerator, so 
numerator is this 
is fx gx fa 
minus g a, rearrange numerator 
get f x minus f a plus g a x 
minus g a this is divided x 
minus a 
i well i actually 
split this separate fractions, 
alright this is fxfaxa, 
gxgaxa 
so this is limit 
fxfaxaxagxgaxa 
thats a a limit is x goes to a 
i calculate that limit 
okay 
im applying these, rules 
calculating limits one rules 
calculating limits is limit 
sum is sum limits provided 
limits exist 
limits well, this is 
really derivative fa this is 
really derivative ga 
i assume that f g 
differentiable a 
so, limits do, exist i 
apply limit sum sum 
limits 
so this limit x goes to a 
fxfaxa limit x goes to 
a gxgaxa, i know 
limits exist 
i even know theyre equal to, 
right i a name limits 
this st limit is derivative f 
a, this nd limit is derivative g 
a 
so this is f prime a plus g prime a 
thats exactly i wanted to 
show,right i wrote definition 
derivative h point a, there 
is is i applied properties limits 
until i conclude that that limit is 
equal 
to derivative fa 
derivative ga, alright this is 
tells to calculate 
derivative a sum 
alright, if ive got a sum 
functions, this is telling that 
long functions 
differentiable a, i calculate 
derivative adding together 
derivatives f g 
hopefully this, this seem 
reasonable, right is 
derivative measuring, right, 
measuring much change in input 
changes output 
right, i want to know much wiggling 
input a, would effect output 
h, thats this derivative is 
measuring 
right well, thats really going to be, 
you know, somehow connected to 
wiggling input to f changes f 
wiggling input to g changes g im 
adding together 
so i think this makes sense that, 
the, output changes would 
sum component 
functions change
