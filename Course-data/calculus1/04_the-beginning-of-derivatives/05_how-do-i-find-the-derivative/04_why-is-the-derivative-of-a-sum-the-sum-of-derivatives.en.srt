[MUSIC]. 
Looks like I've got two functions f(x) 

2
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:14,984
and g(x), and they're both differentiable 
at a. 

3
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:22,017
Then I can define a new function. 
h(x) which is the sum of f and g. 

4
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:28,165
Alright it's a new function, to compute 
h(x) I just plug x into f and I plug x 

5
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:32,210
into g and I add together whatever f and 
g give me. 

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,102
Alright so that's a new function that I 
build from f and g. 

7
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:42,946
Now here's the conclusion, right? Then 
each prime of a is just the sum of the 

8
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:46,664
derivative of f at a and the derivative 
of g at a. 

9
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:52,620
And to prove something like this, this is 
a really a theorem, right? This is a 

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,851
theorem that tells me how to compute. 
The derivative of the sum of functions. 

11
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:02,270
And how do I prove something like this? 
Why I just go back to the definition of 

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,567
derivative. 
Alright. 

13
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:08,820
The derivative of this function h at the 
point a is the limit as x goes to a of, 

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,272
h(x)-h(a)/x-a. 
Now I know what h(x) is. 

15
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:17,674
h(x) is f(x) + g(x). 
So I can plug that in. 

16
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:22,415
Alright, so this is the limit as x goes 
to a of f(x)+g(x). 

17
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:29,792
And I also know what h(a) is, right? I 
just plug in a for x. 

18
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:36,512
And I get that h(a) is f(a)+g(a). 
And this is all divided by the same 

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,220
denominator, x-a. 
Great. 

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:47,194
I want to calculate that limit, right?. 
Well, I can rearrange the numerator, so 

21
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:53,282
the numerator is the same as what? This 
is f(x) + g(x) - f(a). 

22
00:01:53,282 --> 00:02:02,289
Minus g of a, but rearrange the numerator 
and get f of x minus f of a plus g of a x 

23
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,374
minus g of a and this is divided by x 
minus a. 

24
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:16,722
Now what do I do? Well I can actually 
split this up into 2 separate fractions, 

25
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:21,224
alright? This is f(x)-f(a)/x-a, 
g(x)-g(a)/x-a. 

26
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,186
So this is the limit of 
f(x)-f(a)/x-a/x-a+g(x)-g(a)/x-a). 

27
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:34,117
That's a As a limit is x goes to a How do 
I calculate that limit. 

28
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,902
Okay. 
I'm just applying these, these rules for 

29
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:41,697
calculating limits and one for the rules 
of calculating limits is the limit of the 

30
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:45,012
sum is the sum of the limits provided the 
limits exist. 

31
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:49,932
What are these 2 limits? Well, this is 
really the derivative of f(a) and this is 

32
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:53,893
really the derivative of g(a). 
And I assume that f and g are both 

33
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,600
differentiable at a. 
So, those limits do, do exist and I can 

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,442
apply the limit of the sum and the sum of 
the limits. 

35
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:11,795
So this = the limit as x goes to a of 
f(x)-f(a)/(x-a) + the limit as x goes to 

36
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:20,222
a of g(x)-g(a)/x-a, because I know those 
2 limits exist. 

37
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:25,069
And I even know what they're equal to, 
right? I have a name for those 2 limits. 

38
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,960
This 1st limit is the derivative of f at 
a, this 2nd limit is the derivative of g 

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,681
at a. 
So this is f prime of a plus g prime of a 

40
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,378
and that's exactly what I wanted to 
show,right? I wrote down the definition 

41
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,313
of derivative of h at the point a, there 
is is and I applied properties of limits 

42
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:45,172
until I conclude that that limit is 
equal. 

43
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:49,153
To the derivative of f(a) + the 
derivative of g(a), alright? And this is 

44
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:52,108
what tells me how to calculate the 
derivative of a sum. 

45
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:55,778
Alright, if I've got a sum of 2 
functions, this is telling me that as 

46
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,811
long as those 2 functions are both 
differentiable at a, I can calculate the 

47
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:03,382
derivative by just adding together the 
derivatives of f and g. 

48
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:07,469
And hopefully this, this should seem 
reasonable, right? Because what is the 

49
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,390
derivative measuring, right, it's 
measuring how much change in the input 

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,698
changes the output. 
Right, I want to know how much wiggling 

51
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,777
the input a, would effect the output of 
H, and that's what this derivative is 

52
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:21,571
measuring. 
Right? Well, that's really going to be, 

53
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:25,368
you know, somehow connected to how 
wiggling the input to f changes f and 

54
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:29,062
wiggling the input to g changes g and I'm 
just adding them together. 

55
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:39,151
So I think this makes sense that, then 
the, how the output changes which would 

56
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:46,070
be the sum of how these 2 component 
functions change.
