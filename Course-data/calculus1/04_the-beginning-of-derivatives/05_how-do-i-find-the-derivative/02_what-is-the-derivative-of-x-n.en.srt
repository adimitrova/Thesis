1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,132
[MUSIC] Here is the so-called power rule 
for differentiating x^n. 

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:13,443
Nevertheless, here we go. 
When n=1, the derivative of just x^1, 

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:19,829
which is just x, is equal to 1. 
This should make sense because what's the 

4
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:26,729
derivative measuring? The derivative is 
measuring output change compared to input 

5
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:32,370
change. And, in this case, the function 
is just the function that sends x to x. 

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,736
The input and the output are exactly the 
same. 

7
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,726
So, the input and the output change is 
exactly the same, 

8
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:43,735
their ratio is just 1. 
And consequently, the derivative of x, 

9
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:46,582
the derivative of the identity function 
is 1. 

10
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:51,191
For the time being, we're just going to 
think about this when n is a positive 

11
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,270
whole number. But even there, it's pretty 
tricky. 

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,672
Admittedly, when n=1, you're probably 
going to be pretty unimpressed. 

13
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:05,462
The derivative of x^n is n*x^n-1. 
What's n? n can be any real number except 

14
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:09,105
for zero. 
You should think about what you don't 

15
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:13,271
want to plug in zero for n. 
When n=2, that means we're 

16
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,237
differentiating x^2, which we studied a 
little bit ago. 

17
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:22,357
Now, here is the power rule. 
If I plug in 2 for n, I've got the 

18
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:27,075
derivative of x^2=2*x^2-1. 
Or a bit more nicely written, the 

19
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:32,100
derivative of x^2=2x. 
I really remember, we really did study 

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,743
this in quite some detail, you know, 
algebraically, numerically, 

21
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:41,438
geometrically. 
When n=3, we can still study the 

22
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:48,080
derivative of x^3 in a geometric way. 
So, here's the power rule. 

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,072
You plug in n=3, and you get the 
derivative of x^3=3*x^3-1, 3*x^2. 

24
00:01:56,072 --> 00:02:00,840
We can see this geometrically. 
We start with a cube of side length x. 

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,115
And we're going to glue on three green 
slabs of side length x, x, h. 

26
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:10,298
Now, in order to actually thicken up the 
cube, we've got to glue on a few more 

27
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:14,005
pieces, these blue pieces and this red 
corner piece. 

28
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:19,222
But once we've done that, now we've built 
a cube of side length x+h. 

29
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:25,952
How is the volume changed? Well, most of 
the change in volume happened in these 

30
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:30,886
three green slabs, and those three green 
slabs have volume 3x^2h. 

31
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:34,459
The change in the side length of cube is 
h. 

32
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,622
Geometric argument is showing us that the 
derivative of x^3 is 3*x^2. 

33
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:45,621
When n=4, we're trying to differentiate 
x^4. 

34
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:49,807
But that would involve not a cube, but a 
hypercube. 

35
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:58,332
[SOUND] It seems a bit ridiculous to try 
to gain intuition about the derivative of 

36
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:03,902
x^3 by doing something as esoteric as 
studying 4-dimensional geometry. 

37
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:09,820
So instead, let's differentiate x^3 
directly by going back to the definition 

38
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,836
of derivative. 
So, let's proceed directly. I want to 

39
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,833
compute the limit as h approaches 0 of 
x+h^4-x^4/h. 

40
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:22,646
What is this computing? This is the limit 
of the difference quotient. 

41
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,549
This is the derivative of x^4 at the 
point x. 

42
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,574
Now, to proceed, I'm going to make this a 
little bit smaller. 

43
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:33,624
It's a bit too big to work with. 
This is the limit I'm trying to 

44
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,842
calculate. 
The first step is to expand out x+h^4. 

45
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,583
And if I expand x+h^4, this is what I 
get. 

46
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:49,573
(h^4+4h^3x+6h^2x^2+4hx^3+x^4). 
And now, you'll notice something very 

47
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:59,028
exciting. I've got an x^4-x^4 so I can 
cancel those two terms and I'll be left 

48
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:02,184
with a limit of everything else. 
h^4+4h^3x+6h^2x^2+4hx^3/h. 

49
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:12,529
But more good news, 
every single term up in the numerator 

50
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:16,817
here, has an h in it. 
So, I can cancel those h's without 

51
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:21,601
affecting the limit. 
And this limit is the same as the limit 

52
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,222
of h^3+4h^2x+6hx^2+4x^3. 
Why? Well, look. 

53
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:31,207
h^4/h gives me the h^3. 
4h^3x/h gives me the 4h^x/h gives me the 

54
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:35,417
4h^2x, and so forth. 
Now, we're practically there. 

55
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:39,946
I want to evaluate this limit. 
Most of these terms here have got an h in 

56
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,273
it, so when I take the limit, these terms 
are all 0. 

57
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:47,899
The only term that survives is this one 
which as far as h is concerned is a 

58
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:51,248
constant. 
It's the limit of 4x^3 as h approaches 0. 

59
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,403
That's just 4x^3. 
And because this whole mess is 

60
00:04:54,403 --> 00:05:00,102
calculating the derivative of x^4, what 
I've really done here is shown, from the 

61
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:05,134
definition of derivative, that the 
derivative of x^4 is 4x^3. 

62
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:11,076
This limit calculation is perhaps 
complicated enough to give us a glimpse 

63
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:16,226
into the whole story. 
What's the derivative of x^n? Trying to 

64
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:22,152
show the derivative of x^n is nx^n-1. 
And to do that, we go back to the 

65
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:27,077
definition of derivative and try to 
calculate this limit. 

66
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,796
The limit is h goes to 0 of 
(x+h^n)-x^n/h. 

67
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:34,967
Just like the case when n was 4, the 
first step is to expand this out. 

68
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:39,641
But here, it's a bit trickier, right? To 
expand out x+h^n, I don't know exactly 

69
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,738
what n is. 
n's just some positive whole number so I 

70
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:47,214
can't write down exactly what it is. 
But I can write down enough of it to get 

71
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:52,195
a sense of what's going on in the story. 
h^n+nh^n-1x+, and hidden in this dot, 

72
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:55,892
dot, dot is all kinds of other terms that 
have h's in them, 

73
00:05:55,892 --> 00:06:03,131
plus nhx^n-1+x^n-x^n/h. 
Just like before, I've got an x^n and a 

74
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:09,296
-x^n, so I can cancel those. And now, I'm 
left with just these terms, 

75
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:16,172
still a bunch of terms with h's in them. 
And note that every single term in the 

76
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:22,107
numerator here has an h, so I can then do 
the division just like before. 

77
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:29,660
The h^n/h becomes h^n-1, and h^n-1x 
becomes nh^n-2x. 

78
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:36,366
Everything in the dot, 
dot, dot here has at least an h^2 in it. 

79
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:43,760
So, when I divide it by h, everything 
that's left over still has at least one h 

80
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,113
in it. 
This last term nhx^n-1/h becomes nx^n-1 

81
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:52,353
after I divide by h. 
And now, look. 

82
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:57,273
This is a limit. 
As h approaches 0, this term dies, this 

83
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:01,739
term dies, all of these terms with h's in 
them dies. 

84
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:08,905
The only thing that's left is this term 
here, nx^n-1, and that means that this 

85
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:16,368
entire limit is equal to nx^n-1. 
This limit is calculated in the 

86
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:24,074
derivative of x^n. 
So, what we've really managed to do is 

87
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:30,009
show that the derivative of x^n is 
nx^n-1. 

88
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,149
