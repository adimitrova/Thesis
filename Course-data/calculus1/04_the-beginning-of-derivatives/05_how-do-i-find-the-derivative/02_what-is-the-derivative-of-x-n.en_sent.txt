[music] here is the so-called power rule  for differentiating x^n.
nevertheless, here we go.
when n=1, the derivative of just x^1,  which is just x, is equal to 1.  this should make sense because what's the  derivative measuring?
the derivative is  measuring output change compared to input  change.
and, in this case, the function  is just the function that sends x to x.  the input and the output are exactly the  same.
so, the input and the output change is  exactly the same,  their ratio is just 1.  and consequently, the derivative of x,  the derivative of the identity function  is 1.  for the time being, we're just going to  think about this when n is a positive  whole number.
but even there, it's pretty  tricky.
admittedly, when n=1, you're probably  going to be pretty unimpressed.
the derivative of x^n is n*x^n-1.
what's n?
n can be any real number except  for zero.
you should think about what you don't  want to plug in zero for n.  when n=2, that means we're  differentiating x^2, which we studied a  little bit ago.
now, here is the power rule.
if i plug in 2 for n, i've got the  derivative of x^2=2*x^2-1.
or a bit more nicely written, the  derivative of x^2=2x.
i really remember, we really did study  this in quite some detail, you know,  algebraically, numerically,  geometrically.
when n=3, we can still study the  derivative of x^3 in a geometric way.
so, here's the power rule.
you plug in n=3, and you get the  derivative of x^3=3*x^3-1, 3*x^2.
we can see this geometrically.
we start with a cube of side length x.  and we're going to glue on three green  slabs of side length x, x, h.  now, in order to actually thicken up the  cube, we've got to glue on a few more  pieces, these blue pieces and this red  corner piece.
but once we've done that, now we've built  a cube of side length x+h.
how is the volume changed?
well, most of  the change in volume happened in these  three green slabs, and those three green  slabs have volume 3x^2h.
the change in the side length of cube is  h.  geometric argument is showing us that the  derivative of x^3 is 3*x^2.
when n=4, we're trying to differentiate  x^4.
but that would involve not a cube, but a  hypercube.
[sound] it seems a bit ridiculous to try  to gain intuition about the derivative of  x^3 by doing something as esoteric as  studying 4-dimensional geometry.
so instead, let's differentiate x^3  directly by going back to the definition  of derivative.
so, let's proceed directly.
i want to  compute the limit as h approaches 0 of  x+h^4-x^4/h.
what is this computing?
this is the limit  of the difference quotient.
this is the derivative of x^4 at the  point x.  now, to proceed, i'm going to make this a  little bit smaller.
it's a bit too big to work with.
this is the limit i'm trying to  calculate.
the first step is to expand out x+h^4.
and if i expand x+h^4, this is what i  get.
(h^4+4h^3x+6h^2x^2+4hx^3+x^4).
and now, you'll notice something very  exciting.
i've got an x^4-x^4 so i can  cancel those two terms and i'll be left  with a limit of everything else.
h^4+4h^3x+6h^2x^2+4hx^3/h.
but more good news,  every single term up in the numerator  here, has an h in it.
so, i can cancel those h's without  affecting the limit.
and this limit is the same as the limit  of h^3+4h^2x+6hx^2+4x^3.
why?
well, look.
h^4/h gives me the h^3.
4h^3x/h gives me the 4h^x/h gives me the  4h^2x, and so forth.
now, we're practically there.
i want to evaluate this limit.
most of these terms here have got an h in  it, so when i take the limit, these terms  are all 0.  the only term that survives is this one  which as far as h is concerned is a  constant.
it's the limit of 4x^3 as h approaches 0.  that's just 4x^3.
and because this whole mess is  calculating the derivative of x^4, what  i've really done here is shown, from the  definition of derivative, that the  derivative of x^4 is 4x^3.
this limit calculation is perhaps  complicated enough to give us a glimpse  into the whole story.
what's the derivative of x^n?
trying to  show the derivative of x^n is nx^n-1.
and to do that, we go back to the  definition of derivative and try to  calculate this limit.
the limit is h goes to 0 of  (x+h^n)-x^n/h.
just like the case when n was 4, the  first step is to expand this out.
but here, it's a bit trickier, right?
to  expand out x+h^n, i don't know exactly  what n is.
n's just some positive whole number so i  can't write down exactly what it is.
but i can write down enough of it to get  a sense of what's going on in the story.
h^n+nh^n-1x+, and hidden in this dot,  dot, dot is all kinds of other terms that  have h's in them,  plus nhx^n-1+x^n-x^n/h.
just like before, i've got an x^n and a  -x^n, so i can cancel those.
and now, i'm  left with just these terms,  still a bunch of terms with h's in them.
and note that every single term in the  numerator here has an h, so i can then do  the division just like before.
the h^n/h becomes h^n-1, and h^n-1x  becomes nh^n-2x.
everything in the dot,  dot, dot here has at least an h^2 in it.
so, when i divide it by h, everything  that's left over still has at least one h  in it.
this last term nhx^n-1/h becomes nx^n-1  after i divide by h.  and now, look.
this is a limit.
as h approaches 0, this term dies, this  term dies, all of these terms with h's in  them dies.
the only thing that's left is this term  here, nx^n-1, and that means that this  entire limit is equal to nx^n-1.
this limit is calculated in the  derivative of x^n.
so, what we've really managed to do is  show that the derivative of x^n is  nx^n-1.
