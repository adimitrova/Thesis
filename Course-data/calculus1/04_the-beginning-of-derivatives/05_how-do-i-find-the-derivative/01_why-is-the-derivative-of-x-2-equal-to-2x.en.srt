1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,389
[MUSIC] We're going to calculate the 
derivative of x squared with respect to 

2
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,372
x. 
maybe a little bit more prosaically, I 

3
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:13,893
want to know how wiggling x affect x 
squared? 

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:18,366
There's a ton of different ways to 
approach this. 

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:22,462
Let's start by looking at this 
numerically. 

6
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:27,068
So let's start off by just noting that 2 
sqyared is 4, 

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:32,097
and I'm going to wiggle the 2 and see how 
the 4 wiggles. 

8
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,516
Instead of plugging in 2, let's plug in 
2.01. 

9
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:42,018
2.01 squared is 4.0401. 
And let's just keep on going with some 

10
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,672
more examples. 
2.02 squared is 4.0804. 

11
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:51,742
2.003 squared, say, is 4.012009. 
Alright, so those are a few examples. 

12
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:57,336
I've wiggled the inputs, and I've seen 
how the outputs are affected. 

13
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:03,398
And of course the, all the outputs are 
close to 4, alright? But they're not 

14
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:07,651
exactly 4. 
When I wiggled the input from 2 to 2.01, 

15
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:13,681
the output changed by about .04, and a 
little bit more, but that'ts a lot 

16
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:17,781
smaller. 
When I wiggled the input from 2 to 2.02, 

17
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:24,001
the output changed by about .08, not 
exactly .08, but pretty close to .08. 

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:29,492
And when I wiggled from 2 to 2.003, the 
output changed by about. 

19
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:33,469
About .012 and a little bit more, but, 
you know, it's close. 

20
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,491
Now look at the relationship between the 
input change and the output change. 

21
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:43,004
The input change by .01, the output 
change by 4 times as much, about. 

22
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:47,029
The input change by .02, the output 
change by 4 times as much. 

23
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:51,662
The input change by .003, the output 
change by about 4 times as much. 

24
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:57,421
I'm going to summarize that. 
The output change is the input change 

25
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:03,024
magnified by 4 times. 
Right? The input change by some factor. 

26
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:07,632
And the output change by about 4 times 
that amount. 

27
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:12,372
Let's see this at a different input 
point. 

28
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:20,200
Instead of plugging in 2, let's plug in 3 
and see what happens. 

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,581
So 3^2 is 9, but what's, say 3.1^2? 
That's 9.61. 

30
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:33,487
Or what's 3.01^2? Well, that's 9.0601. 
maybe wiggle down a little bit. 

31
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:39,667
What's 2.99 squared? That's close to 3 
but wiggling down by .01. 

32
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:44,757
That's 8.9401. 
Let's see how much roughly the output 

33
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:49,237
changed by. 
When I went from 3 to 3.1 the output 

34
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:56,002
changed by Out point 6. 
When I went from 3 to 3.01, the output 

35
00:02:56,002 --> 00:03:04,919
changed by about .06, and when I went 
from 3 down to 2.99, the output when down 

36
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,292
by about .06 again. 
Little bit less. 

37
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:14,674
Now what's the relationship between the 
input change and the output change? Well 

38
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:19,737
here the input changed by .1, the output 
change by .6, about 6 times as much. 

39
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:24,502
Again, the input change by .01, the 
output changed by About six times as 

40
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:27,369
much. 
And when the input went down by .01 the 

41
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,211
output went down by about six times as 
much. 

42
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:35,194
So again, we're seeing some sort of 
magnification of the output change to the 

43
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:39,951
input change, but now it's magnified not 
by four times But by six times. 

44
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:44,393
So the important lesson here is that the 
extent to which wiggling the input 

45
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,588
affects the output depends on where 
you're wiggling. 

46
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:52,278
If you're wiggling around 2, the output 
is being changed by about four times as 

47
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:54,970
much. 
If you're wiggling the input around 3, 

48
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,362
the output is being change by about six 
times as much. 

49
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:03,992
Instead of doing just a few numerical 
examples, let's generalize this by doing 

50
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,812
some algebra. 
So, I'm starting with x^2 and I'm going 

51
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:13,432
to wiggle x and see how x^2 is effected. 
So, instead of plugging in x, I'll plug 

52
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:16,992
in x + something, let's call the change 
in x, h. 

53
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:24,876
Now I want to know, how is this related 
to x ^ 2? Well I can expand out (x+h)^2, 

54
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:31,426
that's x^2+2xh+h^2. 
So when I wiggle the input from x to x+h, 

55
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:39,692
how is the output being affected? Well 
the output, is the old output value plus 

56
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:45,418
this change in output value 2xh+h^2, h^2 
is pretty small. 

57
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:52,476
When h is small, h^2 is really small so 
I'm going to throw that away for now. 

58
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:59,907
And just summarize this by saying that 
the output change is 2xh and the input 

59
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,227
change. 
Is h. 

60
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:07,797
Now the derivative is supposed to measure 
the relationship between the output 

61
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:12,992
change and the input change. 
So I'm going to take the ratio of the 

62
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:18,972
output change to the input change, and 
2xh/h=2x, as long as h isn't 0. 

63
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:23,947
This is the ratio of output change to 
input change and that makes sense, right? 

64
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:28,992
Think back to what just happened here a 
minute ago, when we were plugging in some 

65
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,532
nearby values and seeing how the outputs 
were affected. 

66
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:37,622
When I was wiggling the input around 2, 
the output was changing by about twice 2. 

67
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:43,814
When I was wiggling the input around 3, 
the output was changing by about twice 3, 

68
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:48,315
alright? 2x is the ratio of output change 
to input change. 

69
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:54,457
If the algebra's not really speaking to 
you, we can also do this geometrically, 

70
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:58,809
like drawing a picture. 
Here's a square of side length x. 

71
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:02,673
The area of this square is not, 
coincidentally, x^2. 

72
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:06,749
Now I want to now the derivative of x^2 
with respect to x. 

73
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:11,498
I want to know how changing x would 
affect the area of this square. 

74
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:17,188
Now to see this here is another square. 
This is a slightly larger square of side 

75
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:20,542
length x+h. 
h is a small but positive number. 

76
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:26,662
So how does the area of this new square 
compare to the area of this old square? 

77
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:32,652
Let me put the old square on top of the 
new square, and you can see that when I 

78
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:37,522
change the input from x to x+h, I gained 
a bit of extra area. 

79
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:43,607
The derivative is recording the ratio of 
output change to input change. 

80
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:49,817
So, I want to know what's the ratio of 
this new area as compared to just the 

81
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:54,633
change in the input H. 
So, let me pull off the extra area. 

82
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,512
There is extra area, is this L shaped 
region. 

83
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:04,900
How big is this L shaped region? Well, 
this short side here, has side length h. 

84
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,569
This side length here, is also h. 
This is the extra length that I added 

85
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,962
when I went from x to x+h. 
This inside has length x, and this inside 

86
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:20,896
edge has length x. 
Now I want to know the area of this 

87
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:25,032
region. 
To see that, I'm going to get out my 

88
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:29,728
scissors and cut this region up into 3 
pieces. 

89
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:37,148
Now here's one of those pieces. 
And, here's another one of those pieces. 

90
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:43,430
And, here's the third piece. 
So these are the 2 long thin rectangles, 

91
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,981
and they've both got height h, and length 
x. 

92
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:50,962
I'm also left with this little tiny 
corner piece. 

93
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:57,211
And that little tiny corner piece has 
side length h, and the other side is also 

94
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,222
length h. 
It's a little tiny square. 

95
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:04,892
Well the limit, this little tiny corner 
piece, is infinitesimal. 

96
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:10,344
I'm going to throw this piece away and 
most of the area is left in these 2 long, 

97
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:13,833
thin rectangles. 
If I rearrange these long, thin 

98
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,982
rectangles a bit, can put them end to 
end. 

99
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:23,322
They've both got height h. 
So I can put them next to each other like 

100
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:26,982
this. 
And their base is both length x. 

101
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:34,032
So how much area is in this long thin 
rectangle? Well, it's height h, it's 

102
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:37,212
width is 2x. 
So the area is 2x * h. 

103
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:43,142
Now this is the additional area, 
excepting for that little tiny square, 

104
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:48,614
which we gained when I changed the size 
of the square from x to x + h. 

105
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:51,915
So the change in output is about 2 * x * 
h. 

106
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:58,177
The change in input was h, so the ratio 
of output change to input change Is 2 * 

107
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:01,192
x. 
Maybe what we're doing here seems a 

108
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:05,312
little bit wishy washy, not really 
precise enough. 

109
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:11,637
But we can also calculate the derivative 
of x ^ 2 with respect to x, by just going 

110
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:16,142
back to the definition of derivative in 
terms of limits. 

111
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:22,723
Carefully, f of x is x^2. 
And the derivative of f is by definition 

112
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:29,424
the limit as h approaches 0. 
F of x plus h minus f of x, the change in 

113
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:37,462
output divided by h, the change in input. 
In this case f of x plus h is just x plus 

114
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:44,382
h squared and f of x is just x squared. 
I'm dividing by h. 

115
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:54,213
I can expand this out. 
This is the limit as h approaches 0 of 

116
00:09:54,213 --> 00:10:01,882
((x+h)^2-x^2)/h. 
Now I've got an x^2-x^2, so I can cancel 

117
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:10,082
those, and I'm just left with the limit, 
as h approaches 0, of (2xh+h^2)/h. 

118
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:17,782
More good news, in the limit I'm never 
going to be plugging h=0, so I can 

119
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:24,741
replace this With an equivalent function 
that agrees with it when h is close to 

120
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:29,027
but not equal to 0. 
In other words, maybe a little bit more 

121
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:34,632
simply, I'm canceling an h from the 
numerator to the denominator. 

122
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:38,902
So, 2xh over h is just 2x and h^x over h 
is just an h. 

123
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:43,922
Now what's the limit of this sum? Well 
that's the sum of the limits. 

124
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:49,185
It's the limit of 2x as h approaches 0 + 
the limit of h as h approaches 0. 

125
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:54,918
Now as far as wiggling h is concerned, 2x 
is a constant, so the limit of 2x as h 

126
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:59,745
approaches 0 is just 2x. 
And what's the limit of h as h approaches 

127
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:04,032
0? Well, what's h getting close to when h 
is close to 0. 

128
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:08,694
That's just 0. 
So, this limit is equal to 2x and that's 

129
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:14,188
the derivative of x^2. 
What that limit is really calculating is 

130
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:20,518
the slope of a tangent line at the point 
x and we can see that it's working. 

131
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:26,342
This is the graph of y=x^2. 
At -4 the slope of the tangent line is -8 

132
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:31,205
At 2, the slope of the tangent line is 4, 
and, at 6, the slope of the tangent line 

133
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,043
is 12. 
There's a ton of different perspectives 

134
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,923
here. 
We've been thinking about the derivative 

135
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:42,038
of x ^ 2 with respect to x, numerically, 
algebriaically, geometrically, going back 

136
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:46,659
to the definition of derivative in terms 
of limits, looking at it in terms of 

137
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,634
slopes of tangent lines. 
What makes derivatives so much fun is 

138
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:54,979
that there just so many different 
perspectives on this single topic, no 

139
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,654
matter how you slice it. 
We've shown that the derivative of x 

140
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:03,325
squared with respect to x is 2 times x. 
Maybe you like algebra, maybe you like 

141
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,481
geometry, maybe you just like to play
