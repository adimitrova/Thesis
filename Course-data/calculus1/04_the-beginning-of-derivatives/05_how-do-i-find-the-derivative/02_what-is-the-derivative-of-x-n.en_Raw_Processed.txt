music here is socalled power rule 
differentiating xn 
nevertheless, here we go 
n, derivative x, 
is x, is equal to 
this make sense whats 
derivative measuring derivative is 
measuring output change compared to input 
change and, in this case, function 
is function that sends x to x 
input output exactly 

so, input output change is 
exactly same, 
ratio is 
consequently, derivative x, 
derivative identity function 
is 
time being, going to 
think this n is a positive 
whole number even there, pretty 
tricky 
admittedly, n, youre probably 
going to pretty unimpressed 
derivative xn is nxn 
whats n n real number except 
zero 
you think you dont 
want to plug in zero n 
n, that means 
differentiating x, we studied a 
little bit ago 
now, here is power rule 
if i plug in n, ive got 
derivative xx 
a bit nicely written, 
derivative xx 
i really remember, we really study 
this in quite detail, you know, 
algebraically, numerically, 
geometrically 
n, we still study 
derivative x in a geometric way 
so, heres power rule 
you plug in n, you get 
derivative xx, x 
we see this geometrically 
we start a cube side length x 
going to glue three green 
slabs side length x, x, h 
now, in order to actually thicken 
cube, weve got to glue a few 
pieces, blue pieces this red 
corner piece 
weve done that, weve built 
a cube side length xh 
is volume changed well, 
change in volume happened in 
three green slabs, three green 
slabs volume xh 
change in side length cube is 
h 
geometric argument is showing us that 
derivative x is x 
n, trying to differentiate 
x 
that would involve a cube, a 
hypercube 
sound seems a bit ridiculous to try 
to gain intuition derivative 
x something esoteric 
studying dimensional geometry 
so instead, lets differentiate x 
directly going back to definition 
derivative 
so, lets proceed directly i want to 
compute limit h approaches 
xhxh 
is this computing this is limit 
difference quotient 
this is derivative x 
point x 
now, to proceed, im going to make this a 
little bit smaller 
a bit big to work 
this is limit im trying to 
calculate 
first step is to expand xh 
if i expand xh, this is i 
get 
hhxhxhxx 
now, youll notice something 
exciting ive got an xx so i 
cancel two terms ill left 
a limit everything else 
hhxhxhxh 
good news, 
every single term in numerator 
here, an h in 
so, i cancel hs without 
affecting limit 
this limit is limit 
hhxhxx 
well, look 
hh gives h 
hxh gives hxh gives 
hx, so forth 
now, practically there 
i want to evaluate this limit 
terms here got an h in 
it, so i take limit, terms 

term that survives is this one 
far h is concerned is a 
constant 
limit x h approaches 
thats x 
this whole mess is 
calculating derivative x, 
ive really done here is shown, 
definition derivative, that 
derivative x is x 
this limit calculation is perhaps 
complicated enough to give us a glimpse 
whole story 
whats derivative xn trying to 
show derivative xn is nxn 
to that, we go back to 
definition derivative try to 
calculate this limit 
limit is h goes to 
xhnxnh 
like case n , 
first step is to expand this 
here, a bit trickier, right to 
expand xhn, i dont know exactly 
n is 
ns positive whole number so i 
cant write exactly is 
i write enough to get 
a sense whats going in story 
hnnhnx, hidden in this dot, 
dot, dot is kinds terms that 
hs in them, 
plus nhxnxnxnh 
like before, ive got an xn a 
xn, so i cancel now, im 
left terms, 
still a bunch terms hs in 
note that every single term in 
numerator here an h, so i 
division like 
hnh becomes hn, hnx 
becomes nhnx 
everything in dot, 
dot, dot here least an h in 
so, i divide h, everything 
thats left still least one h 
in 
this last term nhxnh becomes nxn 
i divide h 
now, look 
this is a limit 
h approaches , this term dies, this 
term dies, terms hs in 
dies 
thing thats left is this term 
here, nxn, that means that this 
entire limit is equal to nxn 
this limit is calculated in 
derivative xn 
so, weve really managed to is 
show that derivative xn is 
nxn
