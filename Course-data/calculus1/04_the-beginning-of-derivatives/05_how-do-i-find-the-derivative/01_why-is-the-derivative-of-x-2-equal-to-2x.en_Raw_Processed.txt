music going to calculate 
derivative x squared respect to 
x 
maybe a little bit prosaically, i 
want to know wiggling x affect x 
squared 
theres a ton different ways to 
approach this 
lets start looking this 
numerically 
so lets start noting that 
sqyared is , 
im going to wiggle see 
wiggles 
instead plugging in , lets plug in 
squared is 
lets keep going 
examples 
squared is 
squared, say, is 
alright, so a few examples 
ive wiggled inputs, ive seen 
outputs affected 
course the, outputs 
close to , alright theyre 
exactly 
i wiggled input to , 
output changed , a 
little bit more, thatts a lot 
smaller 
i wiggled input to , 
output changed , 
exactly , pretty close to 
i wiggled to , 
output changed 
a little bit more, but, 
you know, close 
look relationship between 
input change output change 
input change , output 
change times much, 
input change , output 
change times much 
input change , output 
change times much 
im going to summarize that 
output change is input change 
magnified times 
right input change factor 
output change times 
that amount 
lets see this a different input 
point 
instead plugging in , lets plug in 
see happens 
so is , whats, say 
thats 
whats well, thats 
maybe wiggle a little bit 
whats squared thats close to 
wiggling 
thats 
lets see much roughly output 
changed 
i went to output 
changed point 
i went to , output 
changed , i went 
to , output 

little bit less 
whats relationship between 
input change output change well 
here input changed , output 
change , times much 
again, input change , 
output changed six times 
much 
input went 
output went six times 
much 
so again, seeing sort 
magnification output change to 
input change, magnified 
four times six times 
so important lesson here is that 
extent to wiggling input 
affects output depends 
youre wiggling 
if youre wiggling around , output 
is changed four times 
much 
if youre wiggling input around , 
output is change six 
times much 
instead a few numerical 
examples, lets generalize this 
algebra 
so, im starting x im going 
to wiggle x see x is effected 
so, instead plugging in x, ill plug 
in x something, lets call change 
in x, h 
i want to know, is this related 
to x well i expand xh, 
thats xxhh 
so i wiggle input x to xh, 
is output affected well 
output, is old output value plus 
this change in output value xhh, h 
is pretty small 
h is small, h is really small so 
im going to throw that away 
summarize this saying that 
output change is xh input 
change 
is h 
derivative is supposed to measure 
relationship between output 
change input change 
so im going to take ratio 
output change to input change, 
xhhx, long h isnt 
this is ratio output change to 
input change that makes sense, right 
think back to happened here a 
minute ago, we plugging in 
nearby values seeing outputs 
affected 
i wiggling input around , 
output changing twice 
i wiggling input around , 
output changing twice , 
alright x is ratio output change 
to input change 
if algebras really speaking to 
you, we also this geometrically, 
like drawing a picture 
heres a square side length x 
area this square is not, 
coincidentally, x 
i want to derivative x 
respect to x 
i want to know changing x would 
affect area this square 
to see this here is another square 
this is a slightly larger square side 
length xh 
h is a small positive number 
so area this new square 
compare to area this old square 
let put old square top 
new square, you see that i 
change input x to xh, i gained 
a bit extra area 
derivative is recording ratio 
output change to input change 
so, i want to know whats ratio 
this new area compared to 
change in input h 
so, let pull extra area 
there is extra area, is this l shaped 
region 
big is this l shaped region well, 
this short side here, side length h 
this side length here, is also h 
this is extra length that i added 
i went x to xh 
this inside length x, this inside 
edge length x 
i want to know area this 
region 
to see that, im going to get 
scissors cut this region 
pieces 
heres one pieces 
and, heres another one pieces 
and, heres third piece 
so long thin rectangles, 
theyve got height h, length 
x 
im also left this little tiny 
corner piece 
that little tiny corner piece 
side length h, side is also 
length h 
a little tiny square 
well limit, this little tiny corner 
piece, is infinitesimal 
im going to throw this piece away 
area is left in long, 
thin rectangles 
if i rearrange long, thin 
rectangles a bit, put end to 
end 
theyve got height h 
so i put next to like 
this 
base is length x 
so much area is in this long thin 
rectangle well, height h, 
width is x 
so area is x h 
this is additional area, 
excepting that little tiny square, 
we gained i changed size 
square x to x h 
so change in output is x 
h 
change in input h, so ratio 
output change to input change is 
x 
maybe here seems a 
little bit wishy washy, really 
precise enough 
we also calculate derivative 
x respect to x, going 
back to definition derivative in 
terms limits 
carefully, f x is x 
derivative f is definition 
limit h approaches 
f x plus h minus f x, change in 
output divided h, change in input 
in this case f x plus h is x plus 
h squared f x is x squared 
im dividing h 
i expand this 
this is limit h approaches 
xhxh 
ive got an xx, so i cancel 
those, im left limit, 
h approaches , xhhh 
good news, in limit im never 
going to plugging h, so i 
replace this an equivalent function 
that agrees h is close to 
equal to 
in words, maybe a little bit 
simply, im canceling an h 
numerator to denominator 
so, xh h is x hx h 
is an h 
whats limit this sum well 
thats sum limits 
limit x h approaches 
limit h h approaches 
far wiggling h is concerned, x 
is a constant, so limit x h 
approaches is x 
whats limit h h approaches 
well, whats h getting close to h 
is close to 
thats 
so, this limit is equal to x thats 
derivative x 
that limit is really calculating is 
slope a tangent line point 
x we see that working 
this is graph yx 
slope tangent line is 
, slope tangent line is , 
and, , slope tangent line 
is 
theres a ton different perspectives 
here 
weve thinking derivative 
x respect to x, numerically, 
algebriaically, geometrically, going back 
to definition derivative in terms 
limits, looking in terms 
slopes tangent lines 
makes derivatives so much fun is 
that there so many different 
perspectives this single topic, 
matter you slice 
weve shown that derivative x 
squared respect to x is times x 
maybe you like algebra, maybe you like 
geometry, maybe you like to play 
numbers 
matter interests are, 
derivatives something to offer you
