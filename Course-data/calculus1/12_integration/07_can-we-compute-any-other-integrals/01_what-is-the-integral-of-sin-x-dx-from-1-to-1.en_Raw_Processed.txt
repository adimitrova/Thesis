music we get if we integrate an 
odd function 
instance, happens we 
integrate function sin x minus 
to , right, sin x is an odd function 
consequently, looks like answer is 
remember integral is, is morally 
calculating an assigned area 
so going to calculating this area 
here a negative sign 
going to calculating this area 
here actual area 
right 
a positive sign 
two areas equal, 
integral is going to count this area 
negative sign this area a 
positive sign 
so integral cancel 
answer 
if you dont believe geometry, we 
work algebraically 
so algebraically, im trying to integrate 
minus to sine x dx 
first thing to think is that well 
if im integrating minus to , 
we write that an integral minus to 
sin x dx, add to that 
integral to sin x dx right 
right, if i want to integrate way 
minus to , good enough if i 
integrate half way integrate 
rest way, there is two 
separate intervals 
now, i integrate minus to 
sin x dx 
if we think a little bit 
this really means, that would 
integrating to sin minus x, 
alright 
if i want to add numbers minus 
to , itll good enough if i pick 
partition to evaluate 
sin negative, those, value 
you to worry a little bit 
this dx changes we going to 
looking that in future well 
okay, im going to add to this 
interval to sine x dx that 
ive got right there 
whats sine negative x 
thats negative sine x, here ive 
got sine x dx 
ive got interval to 
negative sine dx plus interval 
to sine dx 
well i pull this minus sign 
integral 
if im integrating a constant time 
something that constant 
times integral 
ive got negative something plus 
thing so that is equal to 
in future going to see 
to justify steps that i took 
algebraically, right 
steps actually valid 
in meantime, upshot here, 
takeaway message is that symmetry 
exploited to calculate integrals, 
right 
you evaluate integral an odd 
function, long youre integrating 
symmetrically across , you evaluate 
that integral to equal to 
exploiting symmetry
