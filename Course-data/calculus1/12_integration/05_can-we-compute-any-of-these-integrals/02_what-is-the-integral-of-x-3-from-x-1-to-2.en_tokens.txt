let
's
integrate
x
cubed
from
0
to
in
this
case
,
the
function
x
cubed
is
a
continuous
function
,
therefore
it
's
an
integrable
function
.
so
,
all
i
need
is
just
to
start
with
a
fine
enough
partition
and
it
wo
n't
matter
how
i
pick
those
sample
points
inside
the
partition
.
my
riemann
sum
will
be
close
to
the
true
value
of
the
integral
.
so
,
i
'll
cut
the
interval
from
0
to
2
into
n
pieces
.
pictorially
,
i
want
to
start
with
the
interval
between
0
and
2
,
and
i
want
to
cut
it
up
into
n
pieces
.
now
,
the
length
of
this
whole
interval
is
two
units
long
,
so
each
is
these
pieces
should
have
a
went
of
2
over
n.
and
that
,
let
me
write
down
the
formula
,
the
cut
point
x
sub
i
will
be
2
over
n
times
i
,
and
that
works
out
great
.
if
i
is
0
,
then
i
'm
at
the
left
hand
endpoint
.
and
if
i
is
n
,
i
'm
at
the
right
hand
endpoint
.
and
in
between
,
i
'm
just
marching
from
the
left
hand
side
to
the
right
hand
side
moving
2
over
n
each
time
.
now
,
how
should
i
choose
my
sample
points
?
i
'm
just
going
to
choose
my
sample
points
,
x
sub
i
star
,
to
be
the
right
hand
end
points
.
so
,
they
'll
be
,
in
fact
the
same
as
x
sub
i.
now
,
i
just
have
to
write
down
the
riemann
sum
for
this
particular
equal
size
partition
and
our
chosen
sample
points
.
in
general
,
the
formula
for
riemann
sum
is
the
sum
,
i
think
it
's
the
sum
,
i
goes
from
1
to
n
of
the
function
evaluated
at
the
i-th
sample
point
times
the
width
of
the
i-th
subinterval
in
my
partition
,
right
?
this
is
the
area
of
the
rectangle
.
and
i
'm
adding
up
all
those
rectangles
to
get
an
approximation
of
the
area
under
the
graph
.
well
,
in
this
specific
case
,
what
do
i
have
?
x
sub
i
star
is
the
same
thing
.
if
i
go
back
to
this
,
x
sub
i
star
is
the
same
thing
as
x
sub
i.
so
,
i
can
just
plug
in
2
over
n
times
i
,
and
x
sub
i
minus
x
sub
i
minus
1
,
that
's
the
width
of
the
i-th
subinterval
in
my
partition
.
but
,
i
rigged
it
so
that
all
of
the
subintervals
have
the
same
equal
width
.
they
've
all
got
width
2
over
n
,
okay
?
so
,
that
's
the
sum
that
i
want
to
calculate
.
now
,
the
function
in
this
case
is
the
cubing
function
.
so
,
this
is
the
same
as
the
sum
i
goes
from
1
to
n
of
2
over
n
times
i
cubed
times
2
over
n
,
which
i
could
simplify
somewhat
.
this
is
the
sum
i
goes
from
1
to
n
of
16
,
2
cubed
times
2
,
over
n
to
the
4th
,
it
's
n
cubed
over
n
times
i
cubed
.
so
that
's
the
particular
riemann
sum
in
this
case
.
quizzes
are
just
a
specific
riemann
sum
for
a
specific
value
of
n.
to
get
the
value
of
the
intregal
,
i
'm
going
to
take
the
limit
an
n
approaches
infinity
.
yeah
,
the
integral
from
0
to
2
of
this
function
x
cubed
is
the
limit
as
n
goes
to
infinity
of
this
riemann
sum
.
now
,
strictly
speaking
,
right
?
this
integral
would
be
a
limit
over
all
the
possible
partitions
.
but
since
the
function
's
integrable
,
it
does
n't
matter
what
partition
i
choose
as
long
as
it
's
fine
enough
.
and
n
going
to
infinity
makes
finer
and
finer
partitions
.
so
,
what
i
really
want
to
calculate
,
in
order
to
calculate
this
integral
,
is
to
calculate
this
limit
.
well
,
let
's
see
if
we
can
do
that
.
the
good
news
here
is
that
i
've
got
a
formula
for
the
sum
of
cubes
.
so
,
we
will
pull
out
that
formula
in
a
minute
.
and
i
've
also
got
a
constant
here
.
16
over
n
to
the
fourth
is
a
constant
.
it
does
n't
depend
on
i
at
all
,
so
i
can
factor
that
out
of
this
sum
by
distributivity
.
so
,
this
is
the
limit
as
n
approaches
infinity
of
16
over
n
to
the
4th
times
the
sum
of
i
cubed
,
i
goes
from
1
to
n.
and
now
,
i
happen
to
know
what
the
sum
of
the
first
n
cubed
is
.
i
can
use
that
formula
that
we
got
from
before
.
that
's
the
same
as
the
sum
of
the
first
n
whole
numbers
squared
.
and
in
this
case
,
that
's
the
limit
as
n
goes
to
infinity
of
16
over
n
to
the
4th
times
,
that
's
n
times
n
plus
1
over
2.
that
's
the
sum
of
the
first
n
whole
numbers
and
the
sum
of
the
first
n
perfect
cubes
is
that
squared
.
now
,
i
've
got
to
figure
out
what
this
is
.
well
,
i
can
factor
out
a
over
2
squared
and
that
'll
cancel
part
of
the
16.
so
,
this
is
the
limit
of
n
squared
times
n
plus
1
squared
times
4
over
n
to
the
4th
.
and
now
this
is
the
limit
as
n
goes
to
infinity
.
this
ends
up
being
n
squares
time
n
squares
plus
lower
order
terms
.
so
,
this
is
,
the
biggest
term
here
is
4n
to
the
4th
over
n
to
the
4th
,
so
this
limit
ends
up
being
equal
to
4.
and
that
is
in
fact
the
integral
from
0
to
2
of
x
cubed
dx
.
that
integral
,
therefore
,
is
equal
to
4.
now
,
what
if
i
wanted
to
do
this
integral
over
some
other
interval
?
well
,
i
could
repeat
this
same
kind
of
calculation
to
deduce
that
the
integral
from
0
to
1
of
x
cubed
dx
is
equal
to
a
quarter
,
right
?
but
that
would
be
another
whole
calculation
that
i
'd
have
to
work
out
.
let
's
say
,
i
wanted
to
integrate
over
the
interval
1
to
2.
well
,
there
's
a
trick
that
you
could
use
.
so
,
the
integral
from
0
to
2
of
x
cubed
dx
,
we
already
calculated
.
but
forget
the
exact
answer
.
what
i
want
to
note
here
is
that
this
is
related
to
two
other
integrals
.
integrating
from
0
to
2x
cubed
dx
is
the
same
as
integrating
from
0
to
1
of
x
cubed
dx
,
and
adding
to
that
the
integral
from
1
to
2.
now
geometrically
,
something
like
that
hopefully
makes
some
sense
,
right
?
if
i
draw
a
graph
,
here
's
0
,
here
's
1
,
here
's
2.
here
's
the
function
y
equals
x
cubed
,
say
this
first
interval
from
0
to
1
is
calculating
the
area
here
,
right
?
that
's
what
this
integral
's
calculating
.
the
second
integral
from
1
to
2
is
calculating
this
area
here
,
right
?
and
if
i
add
together
these
two
areas
,
i
end
up
getting
the
area
from
0
to
2
,
which
is
what
this
integral
's
calculating
.
well
,
the
nice
thing
here
is
that
,
since
i
know
this
integral
and
i
know
this
integral
,
that
's
enough
information
to
recover
this
integral
.
the
integral
from
0
to
2
,
we
saw
a
moment
ago
,
was
4.
the
integral
from
0
to
1
,
i
'm
claiming
here
is
a
quarter
,
and
that
's
enough
information
to
tell
me
that
the
integral
from
1
to
2
of
x
cubed
dx
,
well
,
that
must
be
exactly
what
i
need
to
add
onto
a
quarter
to
get
4
,
that
must
be
15
fourths
,
right
?
so
,
this
red
area
in
here
must
be
15
4th
square
units
.
what
we
're
seeing
here
is
that
you
can
evaluate
some
integrals
just
by
going
back
to
the
definition
and
using
our
knowledge
of
sums
,
but
the
sums
are
ugly
,
right
?
these
are
really
terrible
calculations
.
this
is
the
exact
same
situation
that
we
've
been
in
before
.
a
long
,
long
time
ago
,
we
were
faced
with
the
definition
of
derivative
and
we
started
computing
some
derivatives
just
by
going
back
to
the
definition
of
derivative
.
but
then
,
over
time
,
we
learned
a
bunch
of
rules
which
made
differentiation
a
whole
lot
easier
.
we
're
going
to
see
the
same
thing
happening
here
.
right
now
,
we
're
just
using
these
bare
hand
arguments
to
calculate
integrals
.
but
over
time
,
we
're
going
to
develop
more
tools
for
evaluating
integrals
.
