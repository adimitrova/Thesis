music lets integrate x squared 
to using definition integral 
now, since function x squared is 
continuous, integrable 
so, wont matter exactly we choose 
partition we choose sample 
points long partition is fine 
enough 
so, im going to choose a partition in 
subintervals 
width, n 
im going to divide interval n 
pieces size 
now, ive got to figure exactly 
cut points made 
im labeling points x sub i, so 
left hand n point is x sub 
right hand n point is x sub n, cut 
points in between im cutting to 
partition i n 
so, first one here, one 
anyway, is n 
next one is n, next one is 
n, subintervals 
width, n 
now, i also to choose points to 
sample function at, im going 
to choose right hand end point here 
so, x sub sample point will 
n, x sub sample point will 
n, so 
i write riemann sum, 
right 
riemann sum is sum, i goes 
to n, function evaluated sample 
point times width this ith 
interval, right 
i could write x sub i minus x sub 
i minus 
now, in this case this is a little 
bit easier 
i know i write this a little bit 
nicely, right 
f x i star, x i star i 
n, function squaring 
function 
i rewrite this riemann sum i n 
squared, x i minus x i 
minus 
thats width ith 
subinterval in partition 
thats, you know, far apart 
numbers are, thats n 
so, there is riemann sum associated to 
this particular partition particular 
choice sample point 
i evaluate that exactly using 
facts weve learned sums 
in fact, i want to a little bit 
evaluate this, right 
i want to take limit this n goes 
to infinity 
choosing finer finer 
partitions, thats going to give better 
better approximations to true area 
graph this function, right 
thats area that im trying to 
calculate evaluating this particular 
riemann sum taking limit 
number pieces in equal length 
partition goes to infinity, okay 
so, this is really i want to 
calculate, alright 
i want to calculate limit 
number things in partition, 
equal size, goes to infinity, right 
thats a finer finer partition 
this is riemann sum that we 

this is calculating integral 
to x squared 
right 
well, i this 
well, this is limit n approaches 
infinity sum, i goes to n, 
this is i squared n squared times 
n 
now, n is a constant, so i pull this 
a sum using distributivity 
this is limit n approaches infinity 
n cubed times sum i 
squared, i goes to n 
we think back, ive got a formula 
sum first n perfect squares, 
right 
that formula tells that this is 
limit n goes to infinity n 
cubed times, whats sum 
first n perfect squares 
n times n plus times n plus 

now, i could expand that 
this is limit n goes to infinity 
n cubed times n cubed plus n 
squared plus n 
this limit, well, really 
matters, right 
highest powers 
theres an n cubed in denominator, 
a n cubed in denominator, a n 
cubed in numerator 
n approaches infinity, this is 
rd 
lets summarize this an official 
looking statement 
so, integral to x squared 
dx, right 
weve calculated this rd 
thats really saying is that if 
ive got say, this graph here, say this is 
graph x equals x squared, this 
integral is calculating this area, right 
area between underneath 
graph x squared, right 
this red area here is rd square unit 
a result integral calculation 
now, i play around this a little 
bit 
so, to say that integral to 
x squared dx is rd, well, one thing 
i could this is i could multiply 
this , right 
whats times integral to 
x squared 
well, thats times a rd, thats equal 
to 
times an integral, thats 
integrating to times 
function, right 
this is really worth thinking 
i mean, here im taking this area 
multiplying 
here, im calculating area 
graph stretched in y direction 
times, right 

this is saying that integral 
to x squared dx is equal to 
so, that mean 
so here, ive graphed function y 
equals x squared to 
area in there is rd a square 
unit 
thats first calculation that we 
and, im claiming is that if i 
took this function here 
multiplied , right 
effect stretching in 
y direction times much 
well, that triples area 
so, original area here is a rd, 
theres new area square unit, right 
is ive written here, okay 
so, mean to say that area 
graph is one square unit 
i dont mean is that i take a 
square side length cut 
exactly cover that region 
thats really im talking 
i claim that, that region area 
if i claim that, that region is area one, 
i really mean two different things 
i mean that if i a square a 
little tiny corner nicked it, i 
could take that thing that area 
one unit chop little 
pieces fit that thing entirely inside 
curved region 
conversely, i mean that i could take a 
square side length a little 
bit extra area, i could cut that 
thing little tiny pieces cover 
curved region, right 
fundamentally limits, 
right 
this whole story isnt actually 
achieving anything 
saying that i get close 
i want, right 
saying that i take this almost 
square unit entirely inside, i could 
take a little bit square unit 
cover 
im never actually asserting that 
things equal 
im saying that close 
i like to
