music lets integrate x cubed to 
in this case, function x cubed is a 
continuous function, therefore an 
integrable function 
so, i need is to start a 
fine enough partition wont matter 
i pick sample points inside 
partition 
riemann sum will close to true 
value integral 
so, ill cut interval to 
n pieces 
pictorially, i want to start 
interval between , i want to 
cut n pieces 
now, length this whole interval is 
two units long, so is pieces 
a went n 
that, let write formula, 
cut point x sub i will n 
times i, that works great 
if i is , im left hand 
endpoint 
if i is n, im right hand 
endpoint 
in between, im marching 
left hand side to right hand side 
moving n time 
now, i choose sample points 
im going to choose sample points, 
x sub i star, to right hand end 
points 
so, theyll be, in fact x sub 
i 
now, i to write riemann 
sum this particular equal size 
partition chosen sample points 
in general, formula riemann sum is 
sum, i think sum, i goes 
to n function evaluated 
ith sample point times width 
ith subinterval in partition, right 
this is area rectangle 
im adding rectangles to 
get an approximation area 
graph 
well, in this specific case, i 

x sub i star is thing 
if i go back to this, x sub i star is 
thing x sub i 
so, i plug in n times i, 
x sub i minus x sub i minus , thats 
width ith subinterval in 
partition 
but, i rigged so that 
subintervals equal width 
theyve got width n, okay 
so, thats sum that i want to 
calculate 
now, function in this case is 
cubing function 
so, this is sum i goes 
to n n times i cubed 
times n, i could simplify 
somewhat 
this is sum i goes to n , 
cubed times , n to th, n 
cubed n times i cubed 
so thats particular riemann sum in 
this case 
quizzes a specific riemann sum 
a specific value n 
to get value intregal, im 
going to take limit an n approaches 
infinity 
yeah, integral to this 
function x cubed is limit n goes to 
infinity this riemann sum 
now, strictly speaking, right 
this integral would a limit 
possible partitions 
since functions integrable, 
doesnt matter partition i choose 
long fine enough 
n going to infinity makes finer 
finer partitions 
so, i really want to calculate, in 
order to calculate this integral, is to 
calculate this limit 
well, lets see if we that 
good news here is that ive got a 
formula sum cubes 
so, we will pull that formula in a 
minute 
ive also got a constant here 
n to fourth is a constant 
doesnt depend i all, so i 
factor that this sum 
distributivity 
so, this is limit n approaches 
infinity n to th times 
sum i cubed, i goes to n 
now, i happen to know sum 
first n cubed is 
i use that formula that we got 

thats sum first n 
whole numbers squared 
in this case, thats limit n 
goes to infinity n to th 
times, thats n times n plus 
thats sum first n whole 
numbers sum first n perfect 
cubes is that squared 
now, ive got to figure this is 
well, i factor a squared 
thatll cancel part 
so, this is limit n squared times n 
plus squared times n to th 
this is limit n goes to 
infinity 
this ends n squares time n 
squares plus lower order terms 
so, this is, biggest term here is n 
to th n to th, so this 
limit ends equal to 
that is in fact integral to 
x cubed dx 
that integral, therefore, is equal to 
now, if i wanted to this integral 
interval 
well, i could repeat this kind 
calculation to deduce that integral 
to x cubed dx is equal to a 
quarter, right 
that would another whole 
calculation that id to work 
lets say, i wanted to integrate 
interval to 
well, theres a trick that you could use 
so, integral to x cubed 
dx, we already calculated 
forget exact answer 
i want to note here is that this is 
related to two integrals 
integrating to x cubed dx is 
integrating to x cubed 
dx, adding to that integral 
to 
geometrically, something like that 
hopefully makes sense, right 
if i draw a graph, heres , heres , 
heres 
heres function y equals x cubed, say 
this first interval to is 
calculating area here, right 
thats this integrals calculating 
second integral to is 
calculating this area here, right 
if i add together two areas, i 
end getting area to , 
is this integrals calculating 
well, nice thing here is that, since i 
know this integral i know this 
integral, thats enough information to 
recover this integral 
integral to , we saw a moment 
ago, 
integral to , im claiming 
here is a quarter, thats enough 
information to tell that integral 
to x cubed dx, well, that must 
exactly i need to add onto a 
quarter to get , that must fourths, 
right 
so, this red area in here must th 
square units 
seeing here is that you 
evaluate integrals going back 
to definition using knowledge 
sums, sums ugly, right 
really terrible calculations 
this is exact situation that 
weve in 
a long, long time ago, we faced 
definition derivative we 
started computing derivatives 
going back to definition 
derivative 
then, time, we learned a bunch 
rules made differentiation a whole 
lot easier 
going to see thing 
happening here 
right now, using bare 
hand arguments to calculate integrals 
time, going to develop 
tools evaluating integrals
