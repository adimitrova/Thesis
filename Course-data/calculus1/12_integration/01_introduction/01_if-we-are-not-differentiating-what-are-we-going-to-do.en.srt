00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,836
This new content marks a sudden departure
from

3
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:11,190
what we've been doing in the course do
far.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,480
Practically everything that we've done in
the course

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,290
up til now has involved derivatives in
some form.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,160
And this is now a sudden departure from
that topic.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,100
Now we're going to be looking at area.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,640
You might be thinking that this means
we're going to

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,490
be computing a bunch of areas, but it
would

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,680
be more precise to say that this material
is

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,799
about defining what the very idea of area
even means.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,750
Think way back, to when we were first
learning about the derivative.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,560
When we first learned about the
derivative, you

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,790
might have thought that we were computing
instantaneous velocity.

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,120
But it would have been better to think
that we

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,320
were defining what the very notion of
instantaneous velocity even means.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,710
Right?

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,960
We needed all this machinery of limits to

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,400
even think about precisely what those
concepts mean.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,250
And the same is true for the material now.

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,480
Yes we're going to be computing areas, but
really we're setting

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,660
up the machinery so that we can even
define what area means.

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,330
Of course you might be wondering why is
this in this course.

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,110
Well it turns out that this really does
fit

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,779
into the narrative of the course as a
whole.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,920
We just saw anti differiantion.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,300
And the next thing after looking at area

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,760
is going to be the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,870
And what the fundamental theorem of
calculus is going to do for us,

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,535
it's going to relate anti differentiation
and this process of, of computing area.

31
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,850
Unfortunately we've got to wait a little
bit longer to see that story.

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,410
And for the time being we really going to
focus on just defining what area means,

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,850
we're going to review summation notion so
that

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,420
we can write down these kinds of formulas.

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,560
But hang in there, the connection between
this material

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,920
on area and all the stuff that we're doing

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,330
on differentiation is going to become
crystal clear very soon,

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,680
once we get to the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,090
Which it is arguably really the triumph of
the whole course.

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,775
We've got a little bit longer to wait.

41
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:16,271
Good luck.
