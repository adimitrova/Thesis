music there properties 
integral that worth summarizing 
example, heres a property 
integration thats often useful 
if i want to integrate a to b, right 
thats this last integral is 
area graph between 
a b 
this whole region here that ive 
colored in 
i could split that two 
separate integrals, right 
i could integrate a to c this 
first red integral, i could 
integrate c to b, thats second 
blue interval 
if i add together two areas, i 
get total area a to b, right 
that geometric fact is exactly whats 
written here, symbols using 
fancy integration notation 
theres also a constant multiple rule 
well, heres constant multiple rule 
constant k, integral a 
to b that constant times a function is 
that constant times integral that 
function 
this also makes sense geometrically 
heres two pictures 
heres graph y equals f x 
heres graph y equals k times f 
x 
this thing here calculates this area, 
area graph k times f x 
k times area 
graph f x 
makes sense 
if you take this graph 
stretch k times, that multiplies 
area a factor k 
intergral a sum 
well, integral f x plus g x 
a to b, right 
thats this total area here 
related to area graph 
f area graph g, 
right 
related to integrals 
here, in green, ive sort demonstrated 
area graph f x 
looks like a specific riemann sum 
in here, in red, ive drawn 
rectangles riemann sum g 
theyre, you know, sort shifted 
a bit 
this curve here is graph y 
equals f xx plus g x 
so, heights rectangles 
actually i would get if i to 
integrate g x, right 
distance between f x plus g x, 
f x is exactly g x here in red 
so, this is kind a proof stacking, 
if you like, that integral f plus g 
is integral f plus integral 
g 
a lot rules analogs 
sigma notation stuff 
we this rule that said i could 
pasted together integrals 
theres a corresponding rule sum 
that says, if i sum f numbers 
between m, f numbers 
between m plus k, thats 
applying f to numbers between 
k adding that up, right 
so, this kinds rules, i mean, 
theres an analogy there 
kind game here, right 
ive got this constant multiple rule 
integrals ive got a corresponding 
constant multiple rule sums 
course, this constant multiple rule is 
called distributivity, right 
if i add k times something, thats k 
times sum things 
but, kind rule, right 
i this formula that said integral 
sum is sum integrals 
weve got kind formula a 
sum, right 
if i take a sum f n plus g n, 
thats adding f n 
numbers between a b 
then, adding to that g n 
numbers between a b 
also seeing similarities to 
rules derivatives 
ive got constant multiple rule 
integrals 
ive got a constant multiple rule sums 
ive got a constant multiple rule 
derivatives 
derivative a constant times 
functions that constant times 
derivative function 
kind deals sums, right 
ive got this sum integrals is 
integral sum 
ive got this sum a sum is sum 
sums 
ive got derivative a sum is 
sum derivatives 
fundamentally, mathematics is 
rules, right 
relationships between 
rules 
seeing various objects now, 
integrals, derivatives, sigma 
notation 
theyre sharing common rules, 
right 
working relationships is 
really part fun
