00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,762
[music] There are some properties of the
integral that are worth summarizing.

2
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:12,740
For example, here's a property of
integration that's often useful.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,870
If I want to integrate from a to b, right?
That's what this last integral is.

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,770
And it's the area under the graph between
a and b.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,524
It's this whole region here that I've
colored in.

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,676
But I could split that up into two
separate integrals, right?

7
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:31,459
I could integrate from a to c at this
first red integral, and then I could

8
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:35,202
integrate from c to b, that's the second
blue interval.

9
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:40,281
And if I add together those two areas, I
get the total area from a to b, right?

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:46,100
And that geometric fact is exactly what's
written down here, with symbols using our

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,040
fancy integration notation.
There's also a constant multiple rule.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,705
Well, here's the constant multiple rule.
For some constant K, the integral from a

13
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:59,730
to b of that constant times a function is
that constant times the integral of that

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,580
function.
And this also makes sense geometrically.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,760
Here's two pictures.
Here's the graph of y equals f of x.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,129
Here's the graph of y equals K times f of
x.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,937
This thing here calculates this area, the
area under the graph of K times f of x.

18
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,170
And it's K times just the area under the
graph of f of x.

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,754
And it makes sense.
Because if you take this graph and your

20
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:27,027
stretch it K times, that multiplies the
area by a factor of K.

21
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:32,266
What about the intergral of a sum?
Well, the integral of f of x plus g of x

22
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:35,997
from a to b, right?
That's this total area here.

23
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:40,735
It's related to the area under the graph
of f and the area under the graph of g,

24
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,307
right?
It's related to these integrals.

25
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:50,380
Here, in green, I've sort of demonstrated
what the area under the graph of f of x

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,554
looks like with a specific Riemann sum.
And in here, in red, I've drawn some

27
00:01:56,554 --> 00:02:01,852
rectangles for the Riemann sum of g.
But they're, you know, sort of shifted up

28
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:05,424
a bit.
Because this curve here is the graph of y

29
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:11,290
equals f of Xx plus g of x.
So, the heights of these rectangles are

30
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,705
actually what I would get if I were to
just integrate g of x, right?

31
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:23,326
The distance between f of x plus g of x,
and f of x is exactly g of x here in red.

32
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:28,920
So, this is kind of a proof by stacking,
if you like, that the integral of f plus g

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,930
is the integral of f plus the integral of
g.

34
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,553
A lot of these rules have analogs for the
sigma notation stuff.

35
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:40,928
We had this rule that said I could have
pasted together integrals.

36
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:46,136
And there's a corresponding rule for sum
that says, if I sum f of the numbers

37
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:51,680
between 1 and m, and then f of the numbers
between m plus 1 and K, that's the same as

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,575
applying f to all the numbers between 1
and K and adding that up, right?

39
00:02:56,575 --> 00:03:00,429
So, this same kinds of rules, I mean,
there's an analogy there.

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,738
Same kind of game here, right?
I've got this constant multiple rule for

41
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:09,180
integrals and I've got a corresponding
constant multiple rule for sums.

42
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,261
Of course, this constant multiple rule is
just called distributivity, right?

43
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:17,360
If I add up K times something, that's K
times the sum of these things.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,638
But, it's the same kind of rule, right?
I had this formula that said the integral

45
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:27,129
of the sum is the sum of the integrals.
We've got the same kind of formula for a

46
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,816
sum, right?
If I take a sum of f of n plus g of n,

47
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:34,130
that's the same as adding up f of n for
all the numbers between a and b.

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,845
And then, adding to that g of n for all
the numbers between a and b.

49
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:42,000
And we're also seeing some similarities to
the rules for derivatives.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,001
I've got the constant multiple rule for
integrals.

51
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:49,081
I've got a constant multiple rule for sums
and I've got a constant multiple rule for

52
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,833
derivatives.
The derivative of a constant times some

53
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,099
functions that constant times the
derivative of the function.

54
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,654
Same kind of deals for sums, right?
I've got this sum of the integrals is the

55
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:05,350
integral of the sum.
I've got this sum of a sum is the sum of

56
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,174
the sums.
And I've got the derivative of a sum is

57
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:13,836
the sum of derivatives.
Fundamentally, mathematics is not just

58
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:18,841
about these rules, right?
It's about the relationships between all

59
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,612
of these rules.
We're seeing various objects now,

60
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:26,092
integrals, derivatives, the sigma
notation.

61
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:30,303
And they're all sharing some common rules,
right?

62
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:41,833
And working out those relationships is
really part of the fun.
