music we get a much better sense 
integrals actually computing 
converting integral a function 
so way that im going to package 
together a whole bunch integrals is 
a function, accumulation 
function 
is accumulation function going to 

well, here, ive graphed y equals f 
y plane 
i picked a fixed point a, i 
imagine ive got another point that i 
vary labeled x 
accumulation function, is 
integral a to x 
so computes area between a x 
graph this function 
called accumulation function 
i imagine that i move x to 
side, im kind accumulating 
area 
im determining much area ive 
accumulated between a whatever i plug 
accumulation function 
is this accumulation function 
increasing 
long this function little f is 
positive, accumulation function is 
increasing 
look, to determine whether a functions 
increasing, id to plug in bigger 
inputs see if i get bigger outputs 
thats increasing means 
so if i to plug in bigger input 
right, accumulation function 
figures much area is between a 
this bigger input 
long functions positive 
theres area between a this 
bigger input there between a 
x 
so i summarize this in saying 
that f is positive, that makes 
accumulation function increasing 
is this accumulation function 
decreasing 
is ever possible to integrate a 
longer interval yet get a smaller 
value 
yes, sounds counterintuitive, 
thats entirely possible 
really comes to this issue 
integrals really 
measuring 
integrals exactly measuring 
area, theyre measuring signed area 
so heres an example function 
that im graphing, y equals f t, passes 
the, im calling here, 
axis 
graph is im 
calculating integral, this area here 
counts negative in integral 
so this area is axis here 
is calculated honest area, this 
area here is really contributing negative 
area to integral, right 
i mean, im taking this area im 
subtracting this area to figure 
integral a to x 
comes to is this integral 
is defined 
integral is defined a riemann sum 
functions value evaluated 
various sample points times widths 
tiny rectangles if im 
evaluating function functions 
value is negative thats really 
an area 
thats a signed area could 
negative 
right 
well in light that, happens in 
this particular place 
right 
happens if i plug in a bigger input 
to accumulation function 
is possible that i could integrate 
a longer interval, yet get a smaller 
value 
yeah, this is an exact picture 
sort situation that happens 
if i plug in a bigger input here, 
i integrate a to this bigger 
input, im subtracting this red 
negative area, im subtracting this larger 
red negative area 
in that case accumulation function 
really is smaller, right 
i take x drag here 
im gathering negative area, 
so accumulation function is going 
ill summarize that like this, if 
functions negative accumulation 
function is decreasing 
this sound like 
well that sounds like is that 
derivative accumulation function is 
related to thing im integrating, 
so called integrand 
a, if im integrating a positive function, 
accumulation functions increasing 
another way to say that 
accumulation function is increasing would 
to say that derivative is positive 
so integrands positive, derivative 
accumulation function is positive 
function that im integrating is 
negative, accumulation function is 
decreasing 
derivative accumulation 
function is negative 
integrand negative 
derivative accumulation function also 
negative 
this is first hint fundamental 
theorem calculus 
sort relationship between 
derivatives 
integrals
