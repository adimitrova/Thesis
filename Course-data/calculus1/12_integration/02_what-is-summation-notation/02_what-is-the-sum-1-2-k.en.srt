1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,586
Let's do another summation problem.
The summation problem that I want to do,

2
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:14,765
is the sum as n goes from 1 to a some
number k of just n.

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:19,681
Alright?
In other words, I want to add up 1 plus 2

4
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:25,840
plus 3 dot, dot, dot plus k, right.
I want to add up the first k whole

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,469
numbers.
These are called triangular numbers.

6
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:34,270
The reason is because performing this sum
is really counting the dots in a triangle.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:42,282
Let me draw a picture.
So, 1 dot, 2 dots Three dots, four dots,

8
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:45,054
five dots.
All right?

9
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:49,597
And then I'll keep on going until I get to
K dots.

10
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:52,802
You know, and this picture here is a
triangle.

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,196
Right?
So this sum is counting the number of dots

12
00:00:56,196 --> 00:01:00,290
in a triangle.
Having that k there makes this a very

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,583
general problem, and anytime that you're
confronted with a general problem, it

14
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:10,263
helps to specialize to a specific case.
In order to gain some insight.

15
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:15,545
So let's set k equal to 10.
So I'm just going to do the sum n goes

16
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:22,852
from 1 to k which is now 10 of n.
Which means I'm going to add 1 plus 2 plus

17
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:28,285
3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 plus 8 plus
9 plus 10.

18
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:39,569
I could actually draw this as a triangle.
Put down 1 dot, 2 dots, 3 dots, 4 dots, 5

19
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:49,290
dots, 6 dots, 7 dots, 8 dots, 9 dots, 10
dots.

20
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:55,801
[laugh] So I've got this triangle, and
this sum is just the number of dots in

21
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,000
this triangle.
Now I just count those dots.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,856
I just add those numbers up.
1 plus 2 is 3, 3 plus 3 is 6, 6 plus 4 is

23
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:13,498
10, 10 plus 5 is 15, 15 plus 6 is 21, 21
plus 7 is 28, 28 plus 8 is 36, 36 plus 9

24
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:17,996
is 45, and 45 plus 10.
Is 55.

25
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:23,368
So the sum of the first 10 whole numbers
is 55, and I drew 55 dots to make this

26
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:26,396
triangle.
But there's another approach.

27
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:31,076
Instead of just adding 1 plus 2 plus 3
plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 plus 8 plus 9

28
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:34,124
plus 10, I could add these in a different
order.

29
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:39,665
I could add 1 and 10 together to make 11.
2 and 9 together to make 11.

30
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:44,684
3 and 8 together to make 11.
4 and 7 together to make 11 , and I'm left

31
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:48,115
with 5 and 6 and those two together make
11, right?

32
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:54,340
So I've got five groups of 11, which means
if I add up all these numbers I get 55.

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,742
Armed with this trick I can do the same
thing to attack the problem in general.

34
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:05,990
So in general, I'm trying to do the sum, n
goes from 1 to k of just n.

35
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,187
Trying to add up the first k whole
numbers.

36
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,830
And if I write this in a different order,
and let's say k is even, just to make this

37
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,875
a little bit easier to think about.
Alright I'll take the first number and the

38
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:22,460
last number, and add those together.
The second number and the second-to-last

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,842
number and add those together.
The third number and the third-to-last

40
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:32,004
number, and add those together.
And I'm going to keep on going, right?

41
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:36,755
And the first number and the last number
is, you know, I'm writing it as 1 plus K,

42
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:40,725
that's fine.
The second number and the second-to-last

43
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,618
number, well that's also 1 plus K.
All right, the third number and the

44
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,882
third-to-last that's also 1 plus K.
Right?

45
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:51,200
All of these things add up to 1 plus K.
And the key question is just how many

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,344
things I've got.
All right?

47
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:56,750
And I'm pairing them off in twos.
So, let's say this is an even number.

48
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,480
K is an even number.
And I've got K over 2 pairs.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,182
All of which add up to K plus 1.
And that's just a multiplication problem.

50
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:10,663
Right?
That means that this sum is 1 plus k times

51
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:15,200
k over 2.
So that's the sum of the first k whole

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,388
numbers.
If all this algebra doesn't really speak

53
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,404
to you.
We can redo this geometrically.

54
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,750
So what I want to calculate, right, is
this sum.

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,740
The sum as n goes from 1 to k of n.
And geometrically, right, I can draw this

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,510
pattern of dots, right?
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 in

57
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,127
this case.
But I could imagine that, you know, this

58
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,944
is a specific picture that represents the
general case, right?

59
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:44,160
I've got this triangle, a k by k triangle
of dots.

60
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,471
And this sum is just counting the number
of dots.

61
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,875
Right?
1 plus 2 plus 3, that's exactly what the

62
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,450
sum does.
Now I'm going to count these dots.

63
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,056
So I'll make two copies of this picture.
So now I've got two copies of this sum.

64
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,139
Right?
There's another k by k triangle of dots.

65
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,471
And to count these dots I'm going to take
this triangle, rotate it, and slide it

66
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:10,526
over here.
So as to make not a k by k square, but

67
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:14,393
this is a k plus 1 by k rectangle,
alright?

68
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:19,513
As the bottom of this one just fits in,
but it's a little bit wider.

69
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:22,754
I got this k plus 1 by k rectangle of
dots.

70
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:28,052
So I know there's k plus 1 times k dots
and this is two copies of the sum that I'm

71
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:31,652
interested in.
So 2 times the sum I'm interested in is k

72
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:34,964
plus 1 times k, the number of dots in this
rectangle.

73
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:40,200
And consequently if I just divide by 2 I
get the formula that I'm interested in.

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,627
The sum of n, n goes from 1 to k is k plus
1 times k over 2, right.

75
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:49,690
It's half of the number of dots in this k
plus 1 by k rectangle.

76
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,955
A big part of the joy of mathematics is
that the same ideas can be presented with

77
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,865
very different clothing.
In this case, we're seeing really the same

78
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:07,610
argument.
But presented both algebraically and

79
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,188
geometrically.
