lets another summation problem 
summation problem that i want to do, 
is sum n goes to a 
number k n 
alright 
in words, i want to add plus 
plus dot, dot, dot plus k, right 
i want to add first k whole 
numbers 
called triangular numbers 
reason is performing this sum 
is really counting dots in a triangle 
let draw a picture 
so, dot, dots three dots, four dots, 
five dots 
right 
ill keep going until i get to 
k dots 
you know, this picture here is a 
triangle 
right 
so this sum is counting number dots 
in a triangle 
that k there makes this a 
general problem, anytime that youre 
confronted a general problem, 
helps to specialize to a specific case 
in order to gain insight 
so lets set k equal to 
so im going to sum n goes 
to k is n 
means im going to add plus plus 
plus plus plus plus plus plus 
plus 
i could actually draw this a triangle 
put dot, dots, dots, dots, 
dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, 
dots 
laugh so ive got this triangle, 
this sum is number dots in 
this triangle 
i count dots 
i add numbers 
plus is , plus is , plus is 
, plus is , plus is , 
plus is , plus is , plus 
is , plus 
is 
so sum first whole numbers 
is , i drew dots to make this 
triangle 
theres another approach 
instead adding plus plus 
plus plus plus plus plus plus 
plus , i could add in a different 
order 
i could add together to make 
together to make 
together to make 
together to make , im left 
two together make 
, right 
so ive got five groups , means 
if i add numbers i get 
armed this trick i 
thing to attack problem in general 
so in general, im trying to sum, n 
goes to k n 
trying to add first k whole 
numbers 
if i write this in a different order, 
lets say k is even, to make this 
a little bit easier to think 
alright ill take first number 
last number, add together 
second number secondtolast 
number add together 
third number thirdtolast 
number, add together 
im going to keep going, right 
first number last number 
is, you know, im writing plus k, 
thats fine 
second number secondtolast 
number, well thats also plus k 
right, third number 
thirdtolast thats also plus k 
right 
things add to plus k 
key question is many 
things ive got 
right 
im pairing in twos 
so, lets say this is an even number 
k is an even number 
ive got k pairs 
add to k plus 
thats a multiplication problem 
right 
that means that this sum is plus k times 
k 
so thats sum first k whole 
numbers 
if this algebra doesnt really speak 
to you 
we redo this geometrically 
so i want to calculate, right, is 
this sum 
sum n goes to k n 
geometrically, right, i draw this 
pattern dots, right 
plus plus plus plus plus in 
this case 
i could imagine that, you know, this 
is a specific picture that represents 
general case, right 
ive got this triangle, a k k triangle 
dots 
this sum is counting number 
dots 
right 
plus plus , thats exactly 
sum 
im going to count dots 
so ill make two copies this picture 
so ive got two copies this sum 
right 
theres another k k triangle dots 
to count dots im going to take 
this triangle, rotate it, slide 
here 
so to make a k k square, 
this is a k plus k rectangle, 
alright 
bottom this one fits in, 
a little bit wider 
i got this k plus k rectangle 
dots 
so i know theres k plus times k dots 
this is two copies sum that im 
interested in 
so times sum im interested in is k 
plus times k, number dots in this 
rectangle 
consequently if i divide i 
get formula that im interested in 
sum n, n goes to k is k plus 
times k , right 
half number dots in this k 
plus k rectangle 
a big part joy mathematics is 
that ideas presented 
different clothing 
in this case, seeing really 
argument 
presented algebraically 
geometrically
