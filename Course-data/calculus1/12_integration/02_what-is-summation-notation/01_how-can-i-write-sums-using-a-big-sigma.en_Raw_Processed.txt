music sometimes, youll see a greek 
restaurant a name like this 
so, g, r, sigma, sigma, k restaurant 
little rant here is that this 
say greek restaurant 
says grssk restaurant 
that sigma is really a letter 
right 
sigma makes sound 
yeah, so grssk restaurant 
well, this sigma makes an sound, right 
so, you know, forget this greek restaurant 
story 
whats another word that actually 
start 
alright, a word that starts is sum 
so, going to use that giant sigma 
sums 
lets see an example 
so, ill write a big sigma sum, 
sigma, ill write i 
want to start 
sigma, ill right i want to 
end 
heres i want to add 
so, in this example, i first plug in n 
equals 
right 
times minus is 
then, i plug in n equals 
times minus is 
then, i plug in n equals 
times minus is 
then, i plug in n equals 
times minus is 
then, i plug in n equals 
times minus is 
i keep this, right, until i 
plug in n equals 
is times minus is 
so, to evaluate this sum, right, 
meaning symbols is to add 
plus plus plus , so on, until i 
get to 
we compute this 
well, here we go 
alright, plus is 
plus is 
alright, plus is 
plus is 
plus, whats next number in this 
list, is 
plus is 
plus next number that would come 
this is 
plus is 
plus, next number is 
plus is 
plus is next number, right 

plus is 
plus is 
so, yeah 
if i add plus plus plus plus 
way , adding 
odd numbers between , i get 
thats value this sum 
if you programming experience, 
you think sums like loops 
formally, this notation mean, 
right 
so, i put a big summation symbol, a big 
sigma 
n goes a to b, a b whole 
numbers 
then, ive got expression 
involving n i write a 
function n 
this notation means is to 
plug in numbers between a b, 
whole numbers between a b 
including a b, this expression, 
sum 
right 
giant sigma sum 
you know, so if i wanted to expand this 
out, if i want to right this is 
doing, you know, i first plug in a, i 
plug in a plus , i add to that a, 
whatever i get i plug in a plus , 
dot, dot, dot, i keep going, 
right 
then, i get closer to n 
right n, i plug in b minus 
then, i finish plugging in b i 
add things thats 
value this sum 
alright thats this notation means 
theres one easy case we figure 
whole story 
happens if we take sum a 
constant 
expression that doesnt depend 
indexing variable 
instance, is sum, n goes 
a to b, constant c, 
right 
this is you know, sort expression that 
doesnt involve n 
so, to compute this, we to know 
is many times c is added 

right, so this is c plus c plus, 
keeps going, you know, plus c 
whole issue is many times 
c appears 
c appears b minus a plus times 
that, that plus maybe is a little bit 
confusing 
you see that plus really 
belongs there, if you plug in 
specific values for, b a 
so, if i add c to itself, b minus a plus 
times, this sum is really a 
multiplication problem, right 
repeated addition is called 
multiplication 
c times b minus a plus 
so, sum c n goes a to b is 
c times b minus a plus
