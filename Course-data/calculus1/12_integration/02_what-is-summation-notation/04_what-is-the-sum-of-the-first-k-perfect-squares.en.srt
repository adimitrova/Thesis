1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:09,480
[music] What do we get if we add up a
bunch of perfect squares?

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,847
Say, the first k perfect squares.
What I'm asking for is a formula for this

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:18,890
sum.
The sum of n squared as n goes from 1 to

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,237
k, right?
So 1 squared, plus 2 squared, plus 3

5
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:25,049
squared, plus dot, dot, dot, right?
And so on, until I get to k squared.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,390
What do I get if I add up the first k?
Perfect squares.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,717
Quite shockingly, the resulting formula
ends up looking really nice.

8
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:46,754
This ends up being equal to k times k plus
1 times 2 k plus 1 All over 6.

9
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:51,492
Really?
Well, we can try it for some specific

10
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:52,380
value.
All right.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,252
What if I do the sum and go from 1 to 4 of
N squared.

12
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:02,115
That's 1 squared plus 2 squared plus 3
squared plus 4 squared.

13
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:07,970
That's 1 plus 4 plus 9 plus 16.
4 and 16 make 20.

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,314
1 and 9 make 10.
20 plus 10 is 30.

15
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,864
So the sum of the first four perfect
squares is 30.

16
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:18,670
Is that really what this formula's giving?
Well let's check it out.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,923
So I'm going to put in 4 for K, 4 times 4
plus 1.

18
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:30,070
Times 2 times 4 plus1 all over 6.
What's that?

19
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,663
Well that's 4 times 5 times 2 times 4 plus
1 is 9 divided by 6.

20
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:44,285
6 is 2 times 3, so the 2 kills part of the
4 and part of the 9 to give me 2 times 5

21
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:49,157
times 3.
And yeah, I mean, 5 times 3 is 15, twice

22
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:53,354
15 is 30.
It really works, at least for the value 4.

23
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:57,691
Of course, this isn't a proof in general.
So how am I going to verify that, that

24
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,410
statement is true?
Well, one argument is a geometric

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,823
argument, really a proof by picture.
So here's a geometric or a diagrammatic

26
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:11,801
way of writing down 1 squared plus 2
squared plus 3 squared plus 4 squared.

27
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:15,640
Now I know there's 30 dots here, right.
But I'm trying to draw a diagram that

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,775
suggests a general pattern.
Ok.

29
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:22,227
So let's try to add up.
These, these four numbers.

30
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:25,568
I'm going to use this device here.
What is this?

31
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:34,622
Well, what I've done here is I've taken 3
copies of these k squares, alright.

32
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:38,009
So here's 1 square plus 2 square plus 3
squares plus 4 squares.

33
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,256
Here's another 1 squared plus 2 squared
plus 3 squared plus 4 squared, and in the

34
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:47,575
middle I sort of mixed it up a little bit.
I've taken the lower lefthand corner dot,

35
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,687
which is red, and I've lined them up
vertically here.

36
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:56,914
I've taken the next, sort of three long L
shape which I've drawn in blue here, and

37
00:02:56,914 --> 00:03:00,989
I've straightened them out and placed
those three here.

38
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:09,147
I've taken the two five long orange L's
and straightened them out here, and then

39
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:15,927
here at the top I've got one long brown L
comprised of seven dots, and I've

40
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:20,589
straightened that out right here at the
top.

41
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,916
So what's happened here?
Right, I have taken three copies of my

42
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,917
sums of squares, right so I've got three
copies of all these squares.

43
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,450
One set is down here, one sets down here,
and the other set is mixed in the middle.

44
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,374
And now I can figure out how big a
rectangle this is .

45
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:44,575
Well the bottom here this is a k by k
square, k by k square and these are built

46
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:52,197
out of the corners that are just 1 dot.
So there's a whole bottom side is made up

47
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:57,114
of 2 K plus 1 dots, k plus 1 plus k or 2 k
plus 1.

48
00:03:57,114 --> 00:04:01,025
What about along the other side?
Well along the other side, I've got one

49
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:05,985
dot plus two dots plus three dots plus
four dots and of course, this is just a

50
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:10,657
specific picture.
So in general, it will be 1 plus 2 plus 3

51
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:15,230
plus 4 until I get to k.
So I have to figure out how tall this

52
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,990
rectangle is, but I in fact know a formula
for 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 up through k,

53
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,989
alright.
We figured that out already.

54
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:30,164
It's k times k plus 1 over 2.
So I've taken three copies and built them

55
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:38,131
into a rectangle who's base is 2k plus 1,
and which is k times k plus 1 over 2 tall.

56
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:43,019
So that means that this sum, which is what
I'm trying to compute, must be.

57
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,010
Well its the, the height of this rectangle
times the width of this rectangle divided

58
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,380
by 3, since I used three copies of, of
these squares to build the big rectangle.

59
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,411
So I ended up dividing by 3.
And this is in fact the formula that we

60
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,210
had, right?
The original formula was K times K times 2

61
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,674
K plus 1 times 2 K plus 1 all over 6.
But that's just a rearranged version of

62
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,355
this formula.
There are other geometric arguments as

63
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,976
well.
Other proofs by picture that you could

64
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:14,258
give.
And there are other geometric arguments

65
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,910
too.
Here's another way to get at this sum of

66
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,028
squares formula.
I could right down my sum of squares as

67
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,355
something built out of little tiny
cubelets.

68
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,754
Right?
Here I've got one cube.

69
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:33,904
Underneath I've got 2 squared cubes right,
but this is a 2 by 2 by 1 block.

70
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:36,096
Underneath I've got nine little cubes,
right.

71
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:42,134
It's a 3 by 3 by 1 block.
And underneath that I've got 16 cubes, a 4

72
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,440
by 4 by 1 block, right.
And I can imagine that this thing is k

73
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,910
high.
I take six copies of this pyramid.

74
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,400
You know, fit them together.
Flip one over and so forth.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,915
Until I end up with a K by K plus 1 by 2K
plus 1 box.

76
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:01,150
Right?
And that box must be comprise of K times K

77
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,120
plus 1 times 2K plus 1 little tiny cubes.
And since I used six copies of this thing.

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,460
Well that means the number of cubes in
this thing.

79
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,300
Which is the sum of 1 squared plus 2
squared plus until I get to k squared.

80
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,305
Right?
That sum must be k times k plus 1 time 2k

81
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:22,623
plus 1 divided by 6.
And here, we've given geometric arguments

82
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:26,623
for this particular sum.
But in the future we're also going to see

83
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,195
some algebraic arguments.
Right?

84
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:30,099
But we're going to wait on those a little
bit.

85
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:40,985
For the time being, this particular
quality will be very helpful when we start

86
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:47,171
doing some calculations of, Riemann sum.
