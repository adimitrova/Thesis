music i get if i take one cubed 
plus two cubed plus three cubed plus so 
plus k cubed 
this is a truly remarkable fact 
called nicomachus theorem, says 
that sum first k perfect cubes 
is square sum first 
k whole numbers, literally a 
remarkable fact that two things are, 
equal, right 
i mean, you know, doesnt look 
like this true all, 
is 
now, you believe something like this 
you could rewrite this sum cubes 
formula in maybe a slightly easier way 
right, youve got sum cubes is 
square sum first k 
whole numbers, while we already know a 
formula first k whole 
numbers 
k times k plus , im 
squaring that 
so here is a formula sum 
first k perfect cubes 
k squared times k plus squared 
right 
i took this formula squared 
theres a slick geometric proof 
this fact 
so lets add cubed plus cubed plus 
cubed plus cubed pictorially, course 
arguments going to work in 
general, if i add first k perfect 
cubes 
alright, well heres cubed 
alright 
heres cubed 
dots, ive arranged in a, 
in a cube 
heres cubed, right 
times times , dots, ive 
arranged in, in a cube shape 
cubed would dots, i 
havent drawn dots in, right 
so i want to count dots, 
trick is to rearrange dots 
so thats sort 
pictorial arguments end going 
so im going to rearrange dots like, 
like this 
so here ive made a square, heres 
cube, i added just, dot 
heres cube, ive rearranged 
layers 
cube is right here, ive split 
layer in half 
so if i take this vertical piece 
this horizontal piece, i 
rearrange to make square 
that i stack top that one, 
gives this 
heres cube, , 
squares 
heres cube 
squares, that top square is 
cut in half 
right, so this piece here, this piece 
here, would combine to give another 
square, i stack top 
three to recover 
cube 
i could put five squares 
around, around that i could put 
six squares, id cut one 
squares in half like this 
so even layers i use square thats 
cut in half, odd layers, i 
stack 
the, point here is that i end 
producing a square whose side length is 
plus plus plus 
you know, course this is 
general 
alright, would plus k 
so this is plus plus plus 
ive rearranged sum cubes a 
square, that side length that 
square is sum first k whole 
numbers 
good news is that ive got a formula 
sum first k whole numbers 
k times k plus 
so resulting square side length k 
times k plus , means 
that if i take sum first k 
cubes that number squared 
kinds formulas enable us to 
perform calculations that would 
extraordinarily painful without access to 
formulas 
instance, if i wanted to add 
first perfect cubes, right 
thats thing computing 
sum, n goes to , n cubed 
now, ive got a formula this, 
this is, as, sum 
first hundred whole numbers 
squared, right 
i know to compute this, right 
whats sum first hundred whole 
numbers, well thats times , 
i to square that 
whats a times 
whats sum first hundred 
numbers 
, i to square this 
if i square this i get , , , , , 
right 
so i get million, this makes 
possible, you know, this calculation that 
would horrible tedious, right 
ive got access to this 
formula, i perform really amazing 
numeric feats, right 
this would horrible to calculate, 
this formula, i write 
answer 
if you like kinds formulas, 
heres a challenge 
heres challenge 
whats sum fourth powers 
answers going to polynomial 
in k, right, youve gotta figure 
polynomial that is 
one trick would to plug in values 
say k equals one, k equals two, k equals 
three 
try to find polynomial that 
passes points 
thats challenge 
theres a long tradition here 
bernoulli instance computed sum 
first thousand tenths powers, 
years ago 
people thinking 
kinds formulas a really long time
