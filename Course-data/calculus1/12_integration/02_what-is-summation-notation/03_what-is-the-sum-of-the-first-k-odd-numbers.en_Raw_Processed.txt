music since i know triangular 
numbers i know to sum constants, i 
combine two facts to 
complicated expressions 
example, lets sum n goes 
to k n minus 
right 
this notation mean is that i plug 
in numbers to k this 
expression add 
so, i plug in n equals , i get 
i plug in n equals , i get 
i plug in n equals , i get 
i plug in n equals , i get 
right 
im going to keep going until i end 
k minus 
in words, right, is this asking to 

well, , , , this is adding odd 
numbers, right 
so, i could say in words that this is 
sum first k odd numbers 
right 
im going to add first k odd 
numbers, plus plus , until i get to 
k number, is k minus 
lets first work this algebraically 
so, algebraically, ive got sum n 
minus n goes to k 
this is summing this difference, so i 
could write this difference two 
sums 
so, sums n goes 
to k, im adding n, im 
adding 
now, i pull this factor 
distributivity 
so, this is times sum n n goes 
to k, minus sum 
n goes to k 
i a bit a formula sum 
first k whole numbers, right 
if you remember back to that formula 
thats k plus times k 
whats sum n goes 
to k 
well, this is plus plus plus k 
times 
thats minus k 
now, this is times something divided 
, so this is k plus times k then, 
minus k 
well, if i expand this out, ive got k 
plus times k minus times k 
this is k squared 
so, sum first k odd numbers is 
k squared 
i also see this fact that sum 
odd numbers gives perfect squares 
i see this fact geometrically 
so, ill draw, say one dot, ill 
draw three dots 
right 
this is plus , squared 
then, ill draw five dots 
plus plus , thats squared 
then, ill draw seven dots 
right, thats plus plus plus 
, thats squared 
then, ill draw nine dots, one, two, 
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 
nine 
thats five squared 
plus plus plus plus is 
squared, 
ill add dots, one, two, three, 
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 
plus plus plus plus plus , 
right 
sum first , , , , , odd 
numbers is , , , , , squared, 
so, upshot here is that if you sum odd 
numbers, you end getting perfect 
squares 
and, thats cool independent 
everything else right, you see that 
fact geometrically 
real take away here is to remember 
you actually summation problems, 
right 
if somebody gives you a complicated sum, 
using facts like sum n, 
sum constants, you combine 
facts to evaluate complicated 
summation problems
