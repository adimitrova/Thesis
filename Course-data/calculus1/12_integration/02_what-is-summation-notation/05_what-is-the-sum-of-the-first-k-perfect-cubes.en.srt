1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:10,189
[music] What do I get if I take one cubed
plus two cubed plus three cubed plus so on

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,158
plus K cubed?
This is a truly remarkable fact it's

3
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:19,183
called Nicomachus' Theorem, and it says
that the sum of the first K perfect cubes

4
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:23,983
is the square of just the sum of the first
K whole numbers, and it's literally a

5
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,943
remarkable fact that these two things are,
are equal, right?

6
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:32,841
I mean, you know, it just doesn't look
like this should be true at all, but it

7
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,200
is.
Now, once you believe something like this

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,022
you could rewrite this sum of cubes
formula in maybe a slightly easier way.

9
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:44,183
Right, once you've got the sum of cubes is
the square of just the sum of the first k

10
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:49,019
whole numbers, while we already know a
formula for some of the first k whole

11
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:52,568
numbers.
It's k times k plus 1 over 2, and I'm just

12
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:56,380
squaring that.
So now here is a formula for the sum of

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,152
the first k perfect cubes.
It's k squared times k plus 1 squared over

14
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:01,663
4.
Right?

15
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:07,806
I just took this formula and squared it.
Again there's a slick geometric proof of

16
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:11,026
this fact.
So let's add 1 cubed plus 2 cubed plus 3

17
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:15,738
cubed plus 4 cubed pictorially, of course
the same arguments going to work in

18
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,646
general, if I add up the first k perfect
cubes.

19
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,759
Alright, well here's 1 cubed.
Alright.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,402
Here's 2 cubed.
It's 8 dots, but I've arranged them in a,

21
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:27,319
in a cube.
Here's 3 cubed, all right?

22
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,036
It's 3 times 3 times 3, 27 dots, but I've
arranged them again in, in a cube shape.

23
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:38,073
And then 4 cubed would be 64 dots, but I
haven't drawn all the dots in, right?

24
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:42,610
So I want to count all of these dots, and
the trick is to rearrange these dots.

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,620
So that's how most of these sort of
pictorial arguments end up going.

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,617
So I'm going to rearrange these dots like,
like this.

27
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:58,955
So here I've made a square, and here's the
1 cube, I added just, just 1 dot.

28
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:03,181
Here's the 2 cube, but I've rearranged it
where 1 of the layers of the 2 by 2 by 2

29
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,754
cube is right here, and I've split the
other layer in half.

30
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:11,869
So if I take this vertical 2 by 1 piece
and this horizontal 1 by 2 piece, I can

31
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:16,688
rearrange them to make it 2 by 2 square
that I stack on top of that one, which

32
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:22,600
then gives me this again.
Here's the 3 by 3 by 3 cube, it's 3, 3 by

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,469
3 squares.
Here's the 4 by 4 by 4 cube.

34
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,240
It's 4 squares, but that top square is
been cut in half.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,269
Right, so this piece here, and this piece
here, would combine to give me another 4

36
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,769
by 4 square, which I can stack on top of
these three to recover the 4 by 4 by 4

37
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,211
cube.
Now I could put five 5 by 5 squares

38
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:50,357
around, and then around that I could put
six 6 by 6 squares, but I'd cut one of

39
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:55,828
those squares in half just like this.
So the even layers I use square that's

40
00:02:55,828 --> 00:03:00,147
been cut in half, and the odd layers, I
can just stack them down.

41
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:08,153
The, the point here is that I end up
producing a square whose side length is 1

42
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:11,590
plus 2 plus 3 plus 4.
You know, and of course this is being

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,807
general.
Alright, it would be plus k.

44
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:20,026
So this is 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4.
I've rearranged the sum of cubes into a

45
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:26,206
square, and that side length of that
square is the sum of the first k whole

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,924
numbers.
Good news now is that I've got a formula

47
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:35,277
for the sum of the first k whole numbers.
It's k times k plus 1 over 2.

48
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:42,495
So the resulting square has side length k
times k plus 1 over 2, which then means

49
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:48,617
that if I take the sum of the first K
cubes it's that number squared.

50
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:53,190
These kinds of formulas enable us to
perform calculations that would be

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,138
extraordinarily painful without access to
these formulas.

52
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:02,155
For instance, what if I wanted to add up
the first 100 perfect cubes, right.

53
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:09,256
That's the same thing as computing the
sum, n goes from 1 to 100, of n cubed.

54
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:16,672
Now, because I've got a formula for this,
because this is, the same as, just the sum

55
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:21,454
of The first hundred whole numbers
squared, right?

56
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:25,908
I know how to compute this, right?
What's the sum of the first hundred whole

57
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:30,880
numbers, well that's 100 times 101 over 2,
and I just have to square that.

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,519
What's a 100 times 101 over 2?
What's the sum of the first hundred

59
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,670
numbers?
It's 5,050 and I just have to square this.

60
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,770
And if I square this I get 2, 5, 5, 0, 2,
5, 0, 0.

61
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:48,322
All right?
So I get about 25 million, and this makes

62
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:53,684
possible, you know, this calculation that
would have been horrible tedious, right?

63
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:58,509
But because I've got access to this
formula, I can perform really amazing

64
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,576
numeric feats, right?
This would be horrible to calculate, but

65
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,797
with this formula, I can just write down
the answer.

66
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:09,247
If you like these kinds of formulas,
here's a challenge.

67
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:12,998
Here's the challenge.
What's the sum of fourth powers.

68
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:18,252
The answer's going to be some polynomial
in K, right, but you've gotta figure out

69
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:23,510
which polynomial that is.
One trick would be to plug in values.

70
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,320
Say K equals one, K equals two, K equals
three.

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,260
And then try to find the polynomial that
passes through those points.

72
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,147
Now that's your challenge.
And there's a long tradition here.

73
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:43,510
Bernoulli for instance computed the sum of
the first thousand tenths powers, and he

74
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:51,164
did it 300 years ago.
People have been thinking about these

75
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:57,403
kinds of formulas for a really long time.
