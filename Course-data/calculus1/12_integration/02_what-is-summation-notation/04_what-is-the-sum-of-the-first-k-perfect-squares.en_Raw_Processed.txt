music we get if we add a 
bunch perfect squares 
say, first k perfect squares 
im asking is a formula this 
sum 
sum n squared n goes to 
k, right 
so squared, plus squared, plus 
squared, plus dot, dot, dot, right 
so on, until i get to k squared 
i get if i add first k 
perfect squares 
quite shockingly, resulting formula 
ends looking really nice 
this ends equal to k times k plus 
times k plus 
really 
well, we try specific 
value 
right 
if i sum go to 
n squared 
thats squared plus squared plus 
squared plus squared 
thats plus plus plus 
make 
make 
plus is 
so sum first four perfect 
squares is 
is that really this formulas giving 
well lets check 
so im going to put in k, times 
plus 
times times plus 
whats that 
well thats times times times plus 
is divided 
is times , so kills part 
part to give times 
times 
yeah, i mean, times is , twice 
is 
really works, least value 
course, this isnt a proof in general 
so i going to verify that, that 
statement is true 
well, one argument is a geometric 
argument, really a proof picture 
so heres a geometric a diagrammatic 
way writing squared plus 
squared plus squared plus squared 
i know theres dots here, right 
im trying to draw a diagram that 
suggests a general pattern 
ok 
so lets try to add 
these, four numbers 
im going to use this device here 
is this 
well, ive done here is ive taken 
copies k squares, alright 
so heres square plus square plus 
squares plus squares 
heres another squared plus squared 
plus squared plus squared, in 
middle i sort mixed a little bit 
ive taken lower lefthand corner dot, 
is red, ive lined 
vertically here 
ive taken next, sort three long l 
shape ive drawn in blue here, 
ive straightened placed 
three here 
ive taken two five long orange ls 
straightened here, 
here top ive got one long brown l 
comprised seven dots, ive 
straightened that right here 
top 
so whats happened here 
right, i taken three copies 
sums squares, right so ive got three 
copies squares 
one set is here, one sets here, 
set is mixed in middle 
i figure big a 
rectangle this is 
well bottom here this is a k k 
square, k k square built 
corners that dot 
so theres a whole bottom side is made 
k plus dots, k plus plus k k 
plus 
along side 
well along side, ive got one 
dot plus two dots plus three dots plus 
four dots course, this is a 
specific picture 
so in general, will plus plus 
plus until i get to k 
so i to figure tall this 
rectangle is, i in fact know a formula 
plus plus plus k, 
alright 
we figured that already 
k times k plus 
so ive taken three copies built 
a rectangle whos base is k plus , 
is k times k plus tall 
so that means that this sum, is 
im trying to compute, must 
well the, height this rectangle 
times width this rectangle divided 
, since i used three copies of, 
squares to build big rectangle 
so i ended dividing 
this is in fact formula that we 
had, right 
original formula k times k times 
k plus times k plus 
thats a rearranged version 
this formula 
there geometric arguments 
well 
proofs picture that you could 
give 
there geometric arguments 

heres another way to get this sum 
squares formula 
i could right sum squares 
something built little tiny 
cubelets 
right 
here ive got one cube 
underneath ive got squared cubes right, 
this is a block 
underneath ive got nine little cubes, 
right 
a block 
underneath that ive got cubes, a 
block, right 
i imagine that this thing is k 
high 
i take six copies this pyramid 
you know, fit together 
flip one so forth 
until i end a k k plus k 
plus box 
right 
that box must comprise k times k 
plus times k plus little tiny cubes 
since i used six copies this thing 
well that means number cubes in 
this thing 
is sum squared plus 
squared plus until i get to k squared 
right 
that sum must k times k plus time k 
plus divided 
here, weve given geometric arguments 
this particular sum 
in future also going to see 
algebraic arguments 
right 
going to wait a little 
bit 
time being, this particular 
quality will helpful we start 
calculations of, riemann sum
