1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,877
[music] Sometimes, you'll see a Greek
restaurant with a name like this.

2
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:17,385
So, it's g, r, sigma, sigma, K restaurant.
And my little rant here is that this does

3
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:22,788
not say Greek restaurant.
It says grssk restaurant.

4
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:26,016
That sigma is really a letter S.
Right?

5
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:30,632
Sigma makes the s sound.
Yeah, so grssk restaurant.

6
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:36,333
Well, this sigma makes an s sound, right?
So, you know, forget this Greek restaurant

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,512
story.
What's another word that actually does

8
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:42,460
start with s?
Alright, a word that starts with s is Sum.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,550
So, we're going to use that giant sigma
for sums.

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,174
Let's see an example.
So, I'll write a big sigma for sum, and

11
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:53,546
then below the sigma, I'll write what I
want to start at.

12
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:56,300
Above the sigma, I'll right what I want to
end at.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,400
And here's what I want to add up.
So, in this example, I first plug in n

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,816
equals 1.
Right?

15
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:07,279
And 2 times 1 minus 1 is 1.
Then, I plug in n equals 2.

16
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:12,219
2 times 2 minus 1 is 3.
Then, I plug in n equals 3.

17
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:16,837
2 times 3 minus 1 is 5.
Then, I plug in n equals 4.

18
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:21,799
2 times 4 minus 1 is 7.
Then, I plug in n equals 5.

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,932
2 times 5 minus 1 is 9.
And I keep on doing this, right, until I

20
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:33,983
plug in n equals 10.
Which is 2 times 10 minus 1 which is 19.

21
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:40,518
So, to evaluate this sum, right, the
meaning of these symbols is just to add up

22
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:44,553
1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7, and so on, until I
get to 19.

23
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:47,057
We can compute this.
Well, here we go.

24
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:54,397
Alright, 1 plus 3 is 4.
4 plus 5 is 9.

25
00:01:54,398 --> 00:02:04,728
Alright, 9 plus 7 is 16.
16 plus 9 is 25.

26
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,769
25 plus, what's the next number in this
list, is 11.

27
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:14,866
25 plus 11 is 36.
36 plus the next number that would come

28
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:19,648
after 11 and this is 13.
36 plus 13 is 49.

29
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:26,412
49 plus, the next number is 15.
49 plus 15 is 64.

30
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:32,484
64 plus 17 is the next number, right
before 19.

31
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:38,807
64 plus 17 is 81.
And 81 plus 19 is 100.

32
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,493
So, yeah.
If I add up 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 9

33
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:48,197
all the way up 19, by just adding up the
odd numbers between 1 and 19, I get 100

34
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:53,309
and that's the value of this sum.
If you have some programming experience,

35
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:58,218
you can think of these sums as like loops.
Formally, what does this notation mean,

36
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:01,594
right?
So, I put a big summation symbol, a big

37
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:04,625
sigma.
N goes from a to b, a and b are whole

38
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,091
numbers.
And then, I've got some expression

39
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,420
involving n which I can write as a
function of n.

40
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,836
And what this notation means is just to
plug in all the numbers between a and b,

41
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:18,045
the whole numbers between a and b
including a and b, into this expression,

42
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,773
and then sum them all up.
Right?

43
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:23,611
Giant sigma for sum.
You know, so if I wanted to expand this

44
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:28,923
out, if I want to right out what this is
doing, you know, I first plug in a, then I

45
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:33,820
plug in a plus 1, then I add to that a,
whatever I get when I plug in a plus 2,

46
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,104
and then dot, dot, dot, I keep on going,
right.

47
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:41,449
And then, I get closer to the n.
Right before the n, I plug in b minus 1.

48
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:46,363
And then, I finish by plugging in b and I
add up all these things and that's the

49
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:50,090
value of this sum.
Alright that's what this notation means.

50
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,707
There's one easy case where we can figure
out the whole story.

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,000
What happens if we take the sum of just a
constant?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,324
Some expression that doesn't depend on the
indexing variable at all.

53
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:06,920
For instance, what is the sum, as n goes
from a to b, of just the constant C,

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,719
right?
This is you know, sort of expression that

55
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,320
doesn't involve n at all.
So, to compute this, all we have to know

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,615
is how many times C is being added into
itself.

57
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:23,900
Right, so this is C plus C plus, and it
keeps on going, you know, plus C.

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,337
But the whole issue is just how many times
C appears.

59
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:35,254
And C appears b minus a plus 1 times.
That, that plus 1 maybe is a little bit

60
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,980
confusing.
But you can see that the plus 1 really

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,119
belongs there, if you plug in some
specific values for, for b and a.

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,285
So, if I add C to itself, b minus a plus 1
times, this sum is really just a

63
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:51,424
multiplication problem, right.
Repeated addition is called

64
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,293
multiplication.
It's C times b minus a plus 1.

65
00:04:56,293 --> 00:05:10,386
So, the sum of C as n goes from a to b is
just C times b minus a plus 1.
