1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:07,991
[music] We know what the area of a
rectangle is.

2
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:16,099
Well, if you've got a rectangle, say, of
width a and height b, what should the area

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:22,890
of this rectangle be?
The area of this rectangle is a times b.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:31,281
So what's the area of a triangle?
Well, if we've got a, triangle say of

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:40,462
height b and width a, right.
The area of this triangle is 1 half ab.

6
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:45,607
But why?
Why is that the area of a triangle?

7
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:49,680
Well this is really what the area of the
triangle has to be in order to be

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,617
consistent with the area of the whole
rectangle.

9
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:57,465
I mean, look, I could take two of these
triangles.

10
00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:02,891
Right here's two triangles, both have
width a and height b.

11
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:09,479
But if I push those 2 triangles together,
then I've got the a by b rectangle.

12
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,220
So the area of these 2 triangles together
has to be the area of the rectangle a

13
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,071
times b.
But each of these triangles has half the

14
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:24,472
area of the rectangle.
So the area of just the triangle should be

15
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:29,484
half the area of the rectangle.
Another way to say this is just that, you

16
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:33,358
know, areas sort of add.
You know, area of some figure plus area of

17
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:37,538
some other figure.
Is equal to the area of those two things

18
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:38,793
together.
Right?

19
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:44,240
In this particular case, the area of this
triangle plus the area of this triangle,

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,137
is the area of these two things together,
which is the area of a rectangle.

21
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:54,296
You can play this kind of game to relate
the areas of different figures that

22
00:01:54,296 --> 00:02:00,031
supposedly have the same area.
For example, I could start with a

23
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:07,551
rectangle of width 2 and height 1.
Or, I could start with a square whose side

24
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:13,868
length is the square root of 2.
Now, both of these figures have the same

25
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:18,128
area, right?
The area in both of these figures is 2.

26
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:23,116
And you might ask, well, you know, if the
whole deal with areas is just so that they

27
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:27,604
sort of cut up and add appropriately.
Is it possible for me to cut up this

28
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:32,834
figure in order to get this figure?
And, and yeah, it is in fact possible.

29
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:38,684
Right?
If I cut along the diagonals here, these 4

30
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:45,664
pieces can be rearranged into these 4
pieces here.

31
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:50,393
So, and very visibly, right, if you
believe that, you know, sort of areas add

32
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:53,864
in this way that I'm allowed to rearrange
pieces.

33
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:59,410
Then you might believe that these 2 things
have the same area, regardless of whether

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,376
you do the calculation or not, right?
These 2 pieces have the same area because

35
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:07,707
I can take this thing and cut it up and
get this thing.

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,670
Well here's a challenge for you right
along these lines.

37
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:23,164
For instance can you take a 3x1 rectangle,
and a square of side length root 3.

38
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:26,410
And visibly show that these things have
the same area.

39
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,806
I mean yes.
The calculation, right, is telling me that

40
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:33,832
they both have the same area of 3, 1 times
3 is the same as the square root of 3

41
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:37,450
times the square root of 3.
But what I'm looking for is some sort of

42
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,740
geometric proof where you cut up this
thing and rearrange those pieces to build

43
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,230
this thing, right.
That's your challenge.

44
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,232
So this is really fascinating, right.
What is area?

45
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:53,007
Area is a number, but that number captures
this geometric idea that if two things

46
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:58,683
have the same number, the same area, then
you can take the one thing and chop it up

47
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:03,500
into pieces to get the other thing.
And yet that perspective is totally

48
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,516
destroyed as soon as we start thinking
about something with a curved boundary,

49
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:12,617
like a circle.
So here's a unit circle by which I mean

50
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:17,228
the radius has length 1 unit.
In the area of the unit circle is pi

51
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,310
square units.
I mean yes we know what the formula for

52
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,421
the area of a circle says right, it says
that the area of that unit circle Is pi

53
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:30,400
square units.
But what does that mean?

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,521
What does it mean to say the circle's area
is pi square units?

55
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:40,656
Well I'll tell you what it doesn't mean.
It doesn't mean that I can start with a

56
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:45,932
rectangle of area pi square units.
So say a rectangle of height 1.

57
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:49,918
And with pi, right?
To say that the area of this circle is

58
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,126
equal to pi does not mean that if I just
start with a rectangle with that same

59
00:04:55,126 --> 00:05:00,760
area, that I can necessarily make some
finite number of cuts to this rectangle.

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,353
And take those pieces and rearrange them
to form this disc.

61
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:08,124
All right.
There's really two competing concepts

62
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:11,090
here.
You've already got an idea of area, you

63
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,466
know?
Because you've seen area before.

64
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:18,780
And this idea of area is really based on
this idea that two things have the same

65
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,009
area if you can cut the one thing up and
rearrange the pieces to make the other

66
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,790
thing.
But as soon as you're dealing with objects

67
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,600
with curved boundaries, say, you've
suddenly got a problem, because it's not

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,188
going to be possible for you to take this
object and just chop it up and produce

69
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:43,772
this nice smoothly curved object.
So, somehow you've gotta refine what area

70
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:47,780
even means.
When I say that the area of a circle is pi

71
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,368
square units, I'm secretly speaking in the
language of limits.

72
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:58,167
So, when I say that this circle has area
pi, I mean that if I say cut it up into

73
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:03,560
small enough little rectangles.
The area of these rectangles, which

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,572
actually makes sense, because I know how
to calculate the areas of rectangles, by

75
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,041
multiplying their widths times their
heights.

76
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:15,345
So, if I add up the areas of these
rectangles, I get an answer that's as

77
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:20,960
close as I'd like to the number pi.
And I can get the answer as close as I

78
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,507
want, provided I make these rectangles
thin enough.

79
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:29,850
And it's only in that sense that it, it
even means anything to say, that the area

80
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,139
of the circle is pi.
It's in the sense of that limit.

81
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,536
So even defining area requires talking
about limits, which I think is remarkable.

82
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:42,184
I mean we learn about area in elementary
school, right?

83
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,388
We never talk about limits in elementary
school.

84
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:49,810
And yet somehow there's a real depth, a
real subtlety to even this concept of

85
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,226
area, you know?
And I think that's really exciting.

86
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:57,900
Right?
It suggests that there's something

87
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:07,715
interesting yet to be learned even about
concepts that we think we understand

88
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,433
really well.
