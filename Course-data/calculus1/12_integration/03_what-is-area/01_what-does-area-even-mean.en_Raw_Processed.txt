music we know area a 
rectangle is 
well, if youve got a rectangle, say, 
width a height b, area 
this rectangle 
area this rectangle is a times b 
so whats area a triangle 
well, if weve got a, triangle say 
height b width a, right 
area this triangle is half ab 

is that area a triangle 
well this is really area 
triangle to in order to 
consistent area whole 
rectangle 
i mean, look, i could take two 
triangles 
right heres two triangles, 
width a height b 
if i push triangles together, 
ive got a b rectangle 
so area triangles together 
to area rectangle a 
times b 
triangles half 
area rectangle 
so area triangle 
half area rectangle 
another way to say this is that, you 
know, areas sort add 
you know, area figure plus area 
figure 
is equal to area two things 
together 
right 
in this particular case, area this 
triangle plus area this triangle, 
is area two things together, 
is area a rectangle 
you play this kind game to relate 
areas different figures that 
supposedly area 
example, i could start a 
rectangle width height 
or, i could start a square whose side 
length is square root 
now, figures 
area, right 
area in figures is 
you might ask, well, you know, if 
whole deal areas is so that 
sort cut add appropriately 
is possible to cut this 
figure in order to get this figure 
and, yeah, is in fact possible 
right 
if i cut along diagonals here, 
pieces rearranged 
pieces here 
so, visibly, right, if you 
believe that, you know, sort areas add 
in this way that im allowed to rearrange 
pieces 
you might believe that things 
area, regardless whether 
you calculation not, right 
pieces area 
i take this thing cut 
get this thing 
well heres a challenge you right 
along lines 
instance you take a x rectangle, 
a square side length root 
visibly show that things 
area 
i mean yes 
calculation, right, is telling that 
area , times 
is square root 
times square root 
im looking is sort 
geometric proof you cut this 
thing rearrange pieces to build 
this thing, right 
thats challenge 
so this is really fascinating, right 
is area 
area is a number, that number captures 
this geometric idea that if two things 
number, area, 
you take one thing chop 
pieces to get thing 
yet that perspective is totally 
destroyed soon we start thinking 
something a curved boundary, 
like a circle 
so heres a unit circle i mean 
radius length unit 
in area unit circle is pi 
square units 
i mean yes we know formula 
area a circle says right, says 
that area that unit circle is pi 
square units 
that mean 
mean to say circles area 
is pi square units 
well ill tell you doesnt mean 
doesnt mean that i start a 
rectangle area pi square units 
so say a rectangle height 
pi, right 
to say that area this circle is 
equal to pi mean that if i 
start a rectangle that 
area, that i necessarily make 
finite number cuts to this rectangle 
take pieces rearrange 
to form this disc 
right 
theres really two competing concepts 
here 
youve already got an idea area, you 
know 
youve seen area 
this idea area is really based 
this idea that two things 
area if you cut one thing 
rearrange pieces to make 
thing 
soon youre dealing objects 
curved boundaries, say, youve 
suddenly got a problem, 
going to possible you to take this 
object chop produce 
this nice smoothly curved object 
so, somehow youve gotta refine area 
even means 
i say that area a circle is pi 
square units, im secretly speaking in 
language limits 
so, i say that this circle area 
pi, i mean that if i say cut 
small enough little rectangles 
area rectangles, 
actually makes sense, i know 
to calculate areas rectangles, 
multiplying widths times 
heights 
so, if i add areas 
rectangles, i get an answer thats 
close id like to number pi 
i get answer close i 
want, provided i make rectangles 
thin enough 
in that sense that it, 
even means anything to say, that area 
circle is pi 
in sense that limit 
so even defining area requires talking 
limits, i think is remarkable 
i mean we learn area in elementary 
school, right 
we never talk limits in elementary 
school 
yet somehow theres a real depth, a 
real subtlety to even this concept 
area, you know 
i think thats really exciting 
right 
suggests that theres something 
interesting yet to learned even 
concepts that we think we understand 
really well
