1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,682
[music] We've already got an idea of how
we can approximate the area of a curved

2
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:13,420
region by replacing that curved region
with rectangles.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,748
We've already done this.
If I want to approximate the area under

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:20,100
the curve, I'll just add up the areas of
these rectangles.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,319
And that's a pretty cut approximation of
if these rectangles are thin enough.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,768
If I make those rectangles thinner and
thinner, that gives me better and better

7
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,700
approximations to the area under the
curve.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,257
In fact, more than just approximating the
area under the curve.

9
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:41,563
By making those rectangles thinner and
thinner, I can write down a definition of

10
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:45,240
the area under the curve.
So by taking those triangles to be thinner

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,148
and thinner.
I'm going to get a better and better

12
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,560
approximation to the area under this
curve.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,111
And I'm going to denote that limit by
this, the integral, which is this long,

14
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,425
thin s, from a to b of the function dx,
right?

15
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:05,525
That's how I'm going to write down the
area Under the graph of this function,

16
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:10,730
above the x-axis, and between the line y
equals a and y equals b.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,263
It's going to be by this notation.
Here is the precise definition of the

18
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,621
integral.
To precisely, the integral of this

19
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:25,222
function from a to b is a limit over
partitions of the Riemann sum, alright?

20
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:29,650
And it's a limit over partitions where
I've also chosen some sample points for

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,330
those partitions.
And I'm taking the limit as a maximum

22
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,027
width of a sub-interval in that partition
goes to 0.

23
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:43,394
In order to ensure that all of the widths
of the sub-intervals are going to 0, I

24
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:49,569
just demand that the maximum one, the
biggest one goes to 0, and that forces all

25
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:54,892
the other ones to be small as well.
I had to say that the maximum width goes

26
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:58,139
to 0 to prevent some sort of bizarre
scenario.

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,650
Well I've got one really big sub-interval
and then lots and lots of small

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,986
sub-intervals right?
I want to make sure that all of those

29
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:10,609
sub-intervals are getting very narrow so
that I'm getting a very fine partition in

30
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:14,814
the limit.
There's no guarantee whatsoever that, that

31
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:18,292
limit actually exists.
On the other hand, here's a theorem.

32
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:23,646
If a function f is continuous then it's
integrable, meaning that the integral,

33
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:28,204
right, the integral of the function from
say a to b actually exists.

34
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:32,765
So when I say integraable, what do I even
mean by integrable?

35
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:38,504
If I were to claim that the integral of f
from a to b is equal to some number, big

36
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:44,136
I, what that means is that no matter how I
partition the interval from a to b, as

37
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:50,414
long as that partition is fine enough.
Alright, as long as the maximum width of

38
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:57,860
any rectangle in my skyscraper picture is
small enough, right, as long as the widest

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,912
one Is thin enough.
Then no matter how I choose those sample

40
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:09,352
points within each of the sub-intervals in
my partition, the resulting Reimann sum

41
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:12,880
that I calculate is close to I.
How close?

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,443
Well it's as close as I want it to be.
Right?

43
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:18,754
To say that this is equal to something is
really to say something about a limit.

44
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:23,881
So that means that if I'm asserting that
this is equal to I, it means that I can

45
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:29,040
get the Reimann sum as close as I want to
I by simply demanding that my partition is

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,570
fine enough.
Regardless of how I exactly choose those

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,108
sample points.
And all this talk about Reimann sums is

48
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:40,929
reflected in the very notation in that
we've chosen for the integral.

49
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,210
So here, I've got the integral, the
integral of f from a to b.

50
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,704
And here, I've got a Riemann sum, right,
and this integral is defined to be a limit

51
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:53,251
of these Reimann sums.
And the notation really reflects their

52
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:57,402
common origin, right?
Here, I've got a summation symbol, a Greek

53
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:01,914
sigma, Greek letter s.
And here, I've got a long s.

54
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:06,848
Alright, these are both a kind of sum.
And the thing I'm summing is the function

55
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:11,734
evaluated somewhere times a change in x.
And the thing I'm summing here is the same

56
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:15,340
thing it's the function evaluated
somewhere times a change in x.

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,605
So I hope that even the way I write down
integrals really reminds you that there

58
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,780
are a limit of things that look like this
right.

59
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:36,282
The function evaluated somewhere times
some change in x being added up.
