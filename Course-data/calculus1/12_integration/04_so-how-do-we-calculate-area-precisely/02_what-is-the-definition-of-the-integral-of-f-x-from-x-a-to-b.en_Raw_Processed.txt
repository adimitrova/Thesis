music weve already got an idea 
we approximate area a curved 
region replacing that curved region 
rectangles 
weve already done this 
if i want to approximate area 
curve, ill add areas 
rectangles 
thats a pretty cut approximation 
if rectangles thin enough 
if i make rectangles thinner 
thinner, that gives better better 
approximations to area 
curve 
in fact, approximating 
area curve 
making rectangles thinner 
thinner, i write a definition 
area curve 
so taking triangles to thinner 
thinner 
im going to get a better better 
approximation to area this 
curve 
im going to denote that limit 
this, integral, is this long, 
thin s, a to b function dx, 
right 
thats im going to write 
area graph this function, 
xaxis, between line y 
equals a y equals b 
going to this notation 
here is precise definition 
integral 
to precisely, integral this 
function a to b is a limit 
partitions riemann sum, alright 
a limit partitions 
ive also chosen sample points 
partitions 
im taking limit a maximum 
width a subinterval in that partition 
goes to 
in order to ensure that widths 
subintervals going to , i 
demand that maximum one, 
biggest one goes to , that forces 
ones to small well 
i to say that maximum width goes 
to to prevent sort bizarre 
scenario 
well ive got one really big subinterval 
lots lots small 
subintervals right 
i want to make sure that 
subintervals getting narrow so 
that im getting a fine partition in 
limit 
theres guarantee whatsoever that, that 
limit actually exists 
hand, heres a theorem 
if a function f is continuous 
integrable, meaning that integral, 
right, integral function 
say a to b actually exists 
so i say integraable, i even 
mean integrable 
if i to claim that integral f 
a to b is equal to number, big 
i, that means is that matter i 
partition interval a to b, 
long that partition is fine enough 
alright, long maximum width 
rectangle in skyscraper picture is 
small enough, right, long widest 
one is thin enough 
matter i choose sample 
points within subintervals in 
partition, resulting reimann sum 
that i calculate is close to i 
close 
well close i want to 
right 
to say that this is equal to something is 
really to say something a limit 
so that means that if im asserting that 
this is equal to i, means that i 
get reimann sum close i want to 
i simply demanding that partition is 
fine enough 
regardless i exactly choose 
sample points 
this talk reimann sums is 
reflected in notation in that 
weve chosen integral 
so here, ive got integral, 
integral f a to b 
here, ive got a riemann sum, right, 
this integral is defined to a limit 
reimann sums 
notation really reflects 
common origin, right 
here, ive got a summation symbol, a greek 
sigma, greek letter 
here, ive got a long 
alright, a kind sum 
thing im summing is function 
evaluated somewhere times a change in x 
thing im summing here is 
thing function evaluated 
somewhere times a change in x 
so i hope that even way i write 
integrals really reminds you that there 
a limit things that look like this 
right 
function evaluated somewhere times 
change in x added
