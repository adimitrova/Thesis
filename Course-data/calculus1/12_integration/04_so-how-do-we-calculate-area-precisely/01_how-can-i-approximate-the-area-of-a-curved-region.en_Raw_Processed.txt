music i want to able to compute areas 
curved regions 
instance, here ive got graph y 
equals x squared 
between , i could ask 
calculation 
approximation, least, area 
x axis graph y 
equals x squared, right 
i want to approximate this area in here 
practically, thing that i 
actually know area is rectangles 
so, im going to replace this curved 
region an approximation 
rectangles 
first step is to take that interval, 
to , cut smaller 
pieces 
ill partition interval to 
few pieces 
ill cut pieces 
lets cut a piece to 
piece to 
then, one piece to 
so, ive partitioned interval 
to pieces 
to , to , to 
now, ill pick points inside 
sub intervals, points im 
going to end sampling function 
so, in this first interval, ill pick 
point 
in this second interval to , ill 
pick point 
in third interval to , 
ill pick point 
right 
so, im picking sample points in 
pieces partition 
now, ill build a skyscraper picture 
a, a bunch rectangles that approximates 
curved region 
so, ill sample function 
sample points 
im going to draw this sort 
skyscraper picture 
so, im going to draw a box first 
interval height, whatever sample 

so, there is height is given 
functions value sample point 
in second interval to , i 
sampled 
ill draw a little rectangle there 
in third interval to , i 
sampled 
then, ill draw one rectangle 
right there 
so now, three sub intervals gave rise 
to three rectangles 
now, whats area rectangles 
well, this first rectangle a height 
square a width 
so, this first wide, tall 
rectangle, area 
this rectangle here a height 
squared a width 
so, this rectangle area 
this last rectangle a height 
squared a width 
so, area squared, is 
square units 
now, if i add plus plus , i 
get an area 
thats suppose to an approximation 
to area curved region 
right, i replaced this curved region 
three rectangles 
i calculate areas 
three rectangles 
going to that 
so far true 
area this curved region 
so, thats an approximation, we 
better 
if we want a better approximation to 
area this curve, ill cut 
interval between smaller 
pieces 
i could, in this case, consistently choose 
left end point to sample that i 
draw a whole bunch rectangles 
i could approximate area 
curve calculating area 
rectangles 
taking rectangles 
thinner thinner, ill get an 
increasing good approximation to true 
area this curve 
i also estimate curved 
regions area 
i could also try to estimate this 
i could cut this interval to 
a bunch small intervals 
then, choose right end point 
intervals to 
sampling 
then, build sort skyscraper 
picture 
again, sampling right hand end 
point little tiny sub 
intervals i build this little 
skyscraper picture 
computing area 
rectangles 
alright, areas rectangles 
a pretty good overapproximation to 
area curve 
im going to give a name to 
kinds approximations 
name that given to things 
is a riemann sum, right 
riemann a mathematician 
so, whats procedure setting a 
riemann sum 
well really a multistep process, 
right 
heres a picture that sort summarizes 
whole story 
im trying to calculate area 
curve between points a b im 
that approximation approximating 
curved area rectangles 
i can, course, calculate areas 
rectangles add 
whats first step 
well, first step is to partition this 
interval a to b, so that i decide 
to build little skyscrapers 
alright, so first step here is to 
partition interval a to 
that involves is choosing x not, is 
a 
x sub n is b 
then, choosing x, x, so forth in 
between a b, alright 
in this picture, ive chosen x, x, x, 
x ive cut one, two, 
three, four, five pieces 
but, course, you choose many 
pieces to cut 
point is to choose many 
pieces to cut into, then, choose 
youre going to make those, 
cuts in partition 
next step is to choose sample points 
inside sub intervals 
yeah, ive decided to cut 
interval a to b, ive chosen x 
subis 
then, i introduce blue sample 
points, right, x sub i stars 
so, next step is to choose sample 
points x sub i star, sample 
points will used to determine 
heights rectangles 
im going to evaluating function 
sample points 
now, i write a formula 
area 
well area is approximately areas 
rectangles added 
now, big rectangles 
heights rectangles coming 
function evaluated 
sample points width to 
far apart red cut points 
so, we write a, a formula 
that, right 
im going to write a formula 
area 
so, area is approximately, this is 
really riemann sum, right 
sum, i goes to n 
so, im going to add 
rectangles 
now, ive got to write area 
i rectangle height 
i rectangle, is function 
evaluated sample point 
width ith rectangle is 
x sub i minus x sub i minus 
right 
if i take i cut point subtract 
previous cut point, difference there 
will tell width that rectangle 
let show you picture here 
alright 
so, height rectangles 
coming evaluating function 
sample points width of, say, 
th rectangle, first rectangle, is x 
sub minus x sub 
thats width times height, that gives 
area 
if i add areas 
green rectangles, i get an 
approximation total area 
curve 
to make easy to talk 
things, theres specific names 
that i want to give to particular kinds 
riemann sums 
instance, if we pick ith sample 
point, so x sub i star, to left 
hand endpoint, x sub i minus 
then, i write riemann sum like 
this 
sum rectangles f 
evaluated left hand end point, 
thats sample point, times width 
that particular rectangle 
this is called a left riemann sum, 
ive chosen sample points to 
in left hand side interval 
similarly, right 
theres a right riemann sum i choose 
sample point to right hand 
side, right 
so, this would normally x sub i star, 
sample point is right hand 
endpoint 
so, x sub i 
im going to call this thing a right 
riemann sum
