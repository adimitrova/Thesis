music i want to be able to compute areas
of curved regions
for instance, here ive got the graph of y
equals x squared
and between  and , i could ask for some
calculation
some approximation, at least, of the area
above the x axis and below the graph of y
equals x squared, right
i want to approximate this area in here
practically, the only thing that i
actually know the area of is rectangles
so, im going to replace this curved
region with an approximation by
rectangles
the first step is to take that interval, 
to , and cut it up into some smaller
pieces
ill partition the interval from  to 
into few pieces
ill cut it into  pieces
lets cut it into a piece from  to  and
piece from  to 
and then, one more piece from  to 
so, ive partitioned the interval from 
to  into some pieces
 to ,  to ,  to 
now, ill pick some points inside each of
those sub intervals, points where im
going to end up sampling the function
so, in this first interval, ill pick the
point 
in this second interval from  to , ill
pick the point 
and in the third interval from  to ,
ill pick the point 
right
so, im picking some sample points in each
of the pieces of my partition
now, ill build a skyscraper picture
a, a bunch of rectangles that approximates
my curved region
so, ill sample my function at these
sample points
and im going to draw this sort of
skyscraper picture
so, im going to draw a box over the first
interval of height, whatever the sample
was
so, there is the height is given by the
functions value at the sample point
in my second interval from  to , i
sampled the 
and ill draw a little rectangle there
and in my third interval from  to , i
sampled at 
and then, ill draw one more rectangle
right there
so now, my three sub intervals gave rise
to three rectangles
now, whats the area of those rectangles
well, this first rectangle has a height of
 square and a width of 
so, this first wide, but not very tall
rectangle, has area 
this rectangle here has a height of 
squared and a width of 
so, this rectangle has area 
and this last rectangle has a height of
 squared and a width of 
so, it has area  squared, which is
 square units
and now, if i add  plus  plus , i
get then an area of 
and thats suppose to be an approximation
to the area of the curved region
right, i replaced this curved region by
these three rectangles
and i can calculate the areas of these
three rectangles
its going to be about  and that
should be not so far off from the true
area of this curved region
so, thats an approximation, but we can do
better
if we want a better approximation to the
area under this curve, ill just cut the
interval between  and  up into smaller
pieces
i could, in this case, consistently choose
the left end point to sample that and i
can draw a whole bunch of rectangles now
and i could approximate the area under the
curve just by calculating the area of
these rectangles
and by taking more and more rectangles
thinner and thinner, ill get an
increasing good approximation to the true
area under this curve
i can also over estimate the curved
regions area
i could also try to over estimate this
i could cut this interval from  to  into
a bunch of small intervals
and then, choose the right end point of
each of each of these intervals to do my
sampling at
and then, build the sort of skyscraper
picture
again, sampling at the right hand end
point of each of my little tiny sub
intervals and i can build this little
skyscraper picture
and by computing the area of the
rectangles
alright, the areas of these rectangles are
a pretty good overapproximation to the
area under the curve
im going to give a name to all these
kinds of approximations
the name that were given to these things
is a riemann sum, right
riemann was a mathematician
so, whats the procedure for setting up a
riemann sum
well its really a multistep process,
right
heres a picture that sort of summarizes
the whole story
im trying to calculate the area under the
curve between the points a and b and im
doing that approximation by approximating
the curved area with these rectangles
and i can, of course, calculate the areas
of these rectangles and add them up
but whats the first step
well, the first step is to partition this
interval a to b, so that i can decide
where to build my little skyscrapers
alright, so the first step here is to
partition the interval a to be and what
that involves is choosing x not, which is
just a
and x sub n which is b
and then, choosing x, x, and so forth in
between a and b, alright
in this picture, ive chosen x, x, x,
x and ive cut it up into one, two,
three, four, five pieces
but, of course, you can choose how many
pieces to cut it up into
the point is just to choose how many
pieces to cut it up into, and then, choose
where youre going to make those, those
cuts in the partition
the next step is to choose sample points
inside each of those sub intervals
yeah, after ive decided where to cut up
my interval a to b, ive chosen the x
subis
then, i introduce these blue sample
points, right, the x sub i stars
so, the next step is to choose sample
points x sub i star, and those sample
points will then be used to determine the
heights of these rectangles
im going to be evaluating the function at
those sample points
now, i can write down a formula for the
area
well the area is approximately the areas
of all these rectangles added up
now, how big are each of these rectangles
the heights of these rectangles are coming
from the function evaluated at these
sample points and the width has to do with
how far apart the red cut points are
so, we can write down a, a formula for
that, right
im going to write down a formula for the
area
so, the area is approximately, and this is
really riemann sum, right
its the sum, i goes from  to n
so, im going to add up all of the
rectangles
and now, ive got to write down the area
of the i for rectangle or the height of
the i for rectangle, is the function
evaluated at the sample point
and the width of the ith for rectangle is
x sub i minus x sub i minus 
right
if i take the i cut point and subtract the
previous cut point, the difference there
will tell me the width of that rectangle
let me show you on the picture again here
alright
so, the height of these rectangles are
coming from evaluating the function at the
sample points and the width of, say, the
th rectangle, the first rectangle, is x
sub  minus x sub 
thats the width times height, that gives
me the area
and if i add up the areas of all of the
green rectangles, then i get an
approximation for the total area under the
curve
and just to make it easy to talk about
these things, theres some specific names
that i want to give to particular kinds of
riemann sums
for instance, if we pick our ith sample
point, so x sub i star, to be the left
hand endpoint, x sub i minus 
then, i can write down my riemann sum like
this
its the sum over all the rectangles of f
evaluated at the left hand end point,
thats sample point, times the width of
that particular rectangle
this is called a left riemann sum, just
because ive chosen my sample points to be
in the left hand side of the interval
similarly, right
theres a right riemann sum where i choose
my sample point to be on the right hand
side, right
so, this would normally be x sub i star,
but my sample point is my right hand
endpoint
so, its just x sub i
im going to call this thing a right
riemann sum
