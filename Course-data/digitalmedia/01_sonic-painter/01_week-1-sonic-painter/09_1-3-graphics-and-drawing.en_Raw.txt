[sound]. 
so today i'm going to introduce the 
basics of how to write computer programs 
that draw pictures and that you can 
interact with. 
the first thing you need to do when you 
want to write, draw an image with a 
computer program is turn your image into 
a set of numbers. 
because at a certain level, numbers are 
what computers understand. 
if you think about a computer screen, 
it's composed of millions of pixels. 
these are picture elements. 
these are tiny little squares, each of 
which has their own color. 
and you can think of the screen as a 
large grid of pixels. 
as you can see on my slides here. 
the first thing you need to know when 
you're drawing something to screen is 
which particular pixel you're drawing to 
or collection of pixels, and you need to 
be able to express that as a number. 
so, how do we do that? 
the first thing we do is we have a number 
that represents how many pixels across 
you are. 
that's the horizontal position or what we 
call the x value. 
we also need to know how many pixels down 
you are. 
the vertical position or y value. 
these two numbers give us a position of a 
pixel. 
for example 8, 6 gives us this pixel here 
shown in red. 
so, with two numbers we can get a single 
pixel value. 
so let's have a look at that in practical 
program. 
so this is the program, i showed you 
earlier. 
we've got the size. 
we've got the background, and we can draw 
a point at a certain position. 
say 100, 100. 
now you probably cant even see the point, 
it's actually here, if you see my mouse 
position where i'm clicking. 
why cant you see it? 
because pixels are tiny, let's do 
something else before we proceed and make 
the point a little bit bigger. 
we use this command called stroke weight. 
which gives you the width of lines you 
draw or the size of the points. 
now set that to six and we're going to 
get something a little bit bigger. 
and there we go we can clearly see a 
single point on the screen. 
now, creating images out of individual 
points is going to be hard work. 
so, let's look at how to make some more 
basic shapes. 
okay, so here we have our pixel of 
position 8, 6, with another point given 
by another two numbers, say, 4, 3. 
we can draw a line. 
so, with four numbers, x and y at the 
start position, and the x and y of the n 
position, we can draw a line. 
similarly with another full numbers we 
can go further and draw a rectangle, and 
the only difference being that the first 
two positions are the top left position 
of the rectangle and the other two 
numbers are not a position on the 
rectangle, they are the height and width. 
so let's have another look at trying to 
draw more complex... 
if, instead here, of point, we use the 
command line, we can draw a line to 200, 
300 and see what that looks like. 
there we have a line. 
similarly, the rect command gives us a 
rectangle. 
and here instead of a, the end position 
of the line for the second two points, 
it's the height and width of the 
rectangle. 
so i'm making a square, which has equal 
height and width. 
so there we are. 
let's have a quick look at what i've just 
done. 
so here we are, these are two commands 
i've written. 
size commands. 
what is the size command? 
i showed that in my introduction lecture 
to processing, but i didn't really talk 
about it. 
well, in size, you're passing in 2 
numbers. 
the first number is the x, is the width, 
of the processing window you're creating. 
the second number is the height, the y 
value. 
similarly with a line the first number is 
the x position, the horizontal position 
is the start point. 
then the hot vertical position, the y 
position is, is the start point, and then 
the x and y positions of the end point of 
the line. 
so very simple, with four numbers, you 
can draw a line. 
and from there, you can get many more 
complex shapes. 
the next thing you might want to look at 
is colors. 
so up to now we've been drawing black 
lines. 
how do we represent color as numbers? 
well, if we start with black and white. 
the color coming off a computer monitor 
is really the amount of light that is 
being emitted by each pixel on the 
screen. 
so we can think of the brightness of the 
of a particular pixel, as being a value 
that we can measure. 
and we can measure that brightness at 
some maximum value, which is white and 0, 
which is no color coming off, which is 
black. 
and if you look here, 0 is black. 
and then we can use the value 255 as 
why?. 
why 255? 
well, that happens to be the largest 
value you can fit in 8 bits. 
so 8 ones and 0s on, in computer memory. 
any value in between those two will give 
you gray lighter, or darker gray. 
so you can have shay, any shades or 
variations of gray value between those 
two values. 
fine, that's brightness, but what about 
real color? 
well, when to talk about colors, we need 
to think about primary colors, and if 
you. 
at a very young age at school, you will 
have learned that you can make any color 
by mixing three colors of paint together. 
we're not actually working with paint. 
we're working with light, and that's 
slightly different. 
the primary colors are different, but the 
concept is same, and the primary colors 
we have are green, blue and red. 
and any color can be made up with these 
three, three basic colors. 
why is that? 
it's not a fundamental property of light, 
but it's a fundamental property of our 
eye. 
we have three types of receptor in our 
eye, that are sensitive to green, red, 
and blue parts of the spectrum. 
and, if the light comes between those 
colors, it will trigger. 
a mixture of say, the red and green 
components receptors on our eye. 
therefore we can fool our eye by, instead 
of having a color that's between green 
and red, sending both green and red at 
the same time will look like a mix of 
green and red, which is yellow. 
similarly, green and blue is cyan red and 
blue is magenta, and any other color can 
be mixed from those basic primary colors. 
that's great from a computer graphics 
point of view, because we only need three 
numbers to represent any color, a red 
value, a green value and a blue value. 
so how do we use colors? 
well, there's a number of ways in which 
you can use colors. 
if we look here we've got a basic 
rectangle and what can we change about 
that rectangle? 
well, the first that we can change about 
the rectangle is the border of the 
rectangle and we use the stroke commands. 
stroke means the color of the line that 
we use to draw lines on screen. 
we can also change the center of the 
rectangle using the fill command. 
fill is the color that is used to draw 
the center of any shape, the middle of 
any shape, that we're drawing on screen. 
we've already seen the background 
command, and i'll show you that again 
which has the, changes the background 
color of the screen. 
the last command that i've already shown 
you that is connected is stroke weight 
that doesn't specify color, but it 
specifies the width of any lines you're 
drawing on the screen. 
so let's have a look at that in code. 
so we've already used background, and we 
can see here that we've used backgrounds 
25500, so that's 255 red, 0 green, 0 
blue. 
and as we see, that came out as a bright 
red. 
if we were to change that to 255 zero, 
150, we would mix a little blue in and 
we'd get a different colot. 
sort of more purpley color. 
let's try changing these, the colors of 
this rectangle, so if we use stroke, we 
can set the color of the border of the 
rectangle, let's set it to a bright 
green. 
sorry, just made a mistake there. 
and we can use fill to set the sensor 
color. 
maybe we can use a light blue. 
we mix in light blue by having quite a 
lot of red and green. 
so it's quite bright. 
there's a lot of whiteness in there, but 
more blue. 
and there we go quite a light blue, we 
could make it bluer by turning down the 
red and green. 
so that's, we've got some quite garish 
colors here. 
i wouldn't actually make an application 
with these colors, but it shows you sort 
of how you can mix, mix some basic 
colors. 
the one last thing i want to show you is 
that once you'll called stroke and fill, 
those values continue for everything else 
you draw, so if i draw another rectangle 
eh, then they will be the same colors. 
so by putting in a second fill command, i 
can change the color of my second vector. 
okay, there's one last thing i'd like to 
say about color, which is to talk about 
transparency. 
sometimes when you're specifying colors 
as well as red, green, and blue, you'll 
get a fourth number. 
this is the opacity. 
often called alpha. 
opacity controls how transparent 
something is. 
it's actually the opposite of 
transparency. 
so when the opacity is 255, it means it's 
not transparent at all, and when it's 0, 
it's completely transparent. 
so, to get colors which are partially 
transparent, you need an alpha value 
between 0 and 255. 
so, for example, 255, 0, 0, 128 is half 
transparent red. 
and we can see this in code here, by 
setting the alpha of this rectangle to 
128, and move it slightly so that it 
overlaps the original, the original 
rectangle. 
we don't want it to completely overlap. 
and you can see it is partially 
transparent. 
its color is affecting what's beneath it, 
but not completely. 
and mick will show you some nice examples 
of how you can use transparency to get 
some really nice visual effects. 
so, with what i've shown you so far, you 
can make some nice drawings. 
with computer codes, and that's cool as 
far as it goes. 
but it's not really a computer program 
yet because all it's doing is drawing a 
picture. 
when you think of a computer program you 
want to interact with it. 
it has to do things independently. 
so if we look at what our program is 
doing up to now. 
we're pressing play, it's running its 
code. 
and when it finish, it will draw a 
picture and we can look at it. 
but that's not how we, you complete a 
program 1, we want to be able to interact 
with that code. 
so we can do this by splitting a code 
into news and number bit. 
first off, we we have some stuff that 
should never change. 
for example, the size of the screen, the 
background color. 
they should always stay. 
[inaudible] and that's what we call the 
setup part of our program. 
and then there's stuff that should 
change, so for example, the things that 
we're drawing, like the lines, they 
should move around based on what we're 
doing. 
that's the drawing part of our program. 
and we put them in two different blocks 
of code. 
the first one we put in a block of code 
called setup i won't get into full 
details of what everything means here. 
if you're familiar with java, you will 
understand it. 
if not, look at some of my additional 
lectures. 
but void setup is what's called a 
function, and that contains all the code 
that we do at the beginning of the 
program and it happens only once. 
the important thing to note here are 
these curly brackets. 
they say they tell you where the start 
and end of the setup code is. 
similarly, we can have functions which 
happen times the response to certain 
events. 
so for example, i can have alpha function 
mousedragged. 
what mousedragged does is that it happens 
every time you move the mouse while the 
mouse button is held hold down. 
a very useful function for interaction. 
so what happens now is i move the mouse, 
i give some input, mouse drag responds 
and i play and then it paints a picture 
and i can see that. 
that's fine, but if you look at the code 
as it is now, every time i call mouse 
dragged, it's drawing the same line 
because the numbers in there aren't 
changing. 
i need to put in different numbers to my 
line in order to change the interaction 
i'm getting and make it truly 
interactive, to make it respond to my 
mouse movements. 
and this is how i can do it. 
rather than putting a number in there, 
i'm putting in the value mouse x mouse y 
pmouse x pmouse y. 
now what are these things. 
well these are variables their names 
stand for numbers if you're not familiar 
with the term variable. 
but if you're not then you should look at 
my additional lectures. 
and mouse x and mouse y are automatically 
set to the current position of the mouse. 
so this is your mouse position as an x 
and y value. 
pmouse and x and pmousey are useful 
values. 
they give you the previous position of 
the mouse and that's what enables us to 
do some, some smooth drawing. 
i'll show you that in a minute. 
so let's look at some code that does 
this. 
so this is about the most basic 
interactive code you can get in 
processing. 
we have a setup function that sets the 
size of the screen and the background 
color, and a mouse drag function that 
draws a point that the position is the 
mouse. 
so let's see what that does. 
we've got a nice little drawing. 
that's nice, but, when i draw, i'd like 
to actually sort of draw continuous 
lines, and we can do that with the code i 
just showed you, because we can draw a 
line from the previous mouse position to 
the current mouse position. 
[noise] and there we are, some nice 
continuous lines drawn. 
now, we've got a nice bit of interaction 
but it doesn't look great, there's a lot 
we can do with this aesthetically to 
make. 
in a few minutes we'll talk to you about 
that. 
but for now, that's most of want to say, 
what, what i'm going to say. 
i just want to show you one little trick. 
about the background function. 
so at the moment it's not. 
every time i draw, it's drawing on top of 
what i've already drawn. 
and sometimes that's what we want. 
sometimes what, that's what we don't. 
not what we want. 
if i move the function background into 
mouse dragged as well as setting the 
background color what background does is 
it clears the screen. 
so if i move it into mouse dragged it's, 
it's clearing the screen so i've no 
longer accumulated all the drawings i've 
ever done. 
and i just get this tiny little try off 
the mouse. 
maybe not exactly what we want now. 
but there's lots of situations where it 
is exactly what we want. 
and next week we'll show you that in 
detail. 
so, so far what we've got is the ability 
to draw some basic energies to screen. 
some basic shapes and interact with that 
by responding to mouse position. 
there's a lot more we, you can do while 
you're drawing, and i would recommend 
that you look at the the processing 
website, processing.org. 
there's a link to it from the from our 
our call server site, and particularly 
look at the processing reference and look 
at some of the examples for shapes. 
a good example is to look at the ellipse 
command so far we've looked at lines, and 
rectangles. 
ellipse shows you how to draw ellipses, 
and circles, and, and with that, that's 
already part of your repertoire, but it 
will already, it will also start you 
learning how to use the reference for, 
for processing, and pick up, and use new 
commands that will enable you to do more 
complex drawing. 
so i'll leave you here and matthew will 
talk a bit about how to do audio 
processing in processing and then mick 
will show you more complex examples using 
the basis, basic code that we've learned 
here...
