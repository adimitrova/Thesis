sound 
okay, so one first things we 
to learn to is to run applications 
mobile devices 
matt will already shown you 
to run stuff android, marco will 
shown you to run stuff 
desktop 
im going to show you you run 
application, using code that 
weve prepared you, in download 
pack is off, is 
coursera 
so that you exactly code, 
write code, run 
three devices, specifically on, 
ios device 
now, crucially, way this 
part this program, is running 
iosspecific code 
javascript 
so, you finish making 
application, you press go builds a 
webpage specifically ios mobile 
device 
theres a couple little tricky things 
that we need to get right first time 
we it, im going to talk you 
right 
firstly, we start a 
straightforward sketch 
now, im going to use a sketch that 
were, going to talk later 
in lesson one, called sonic painter 
this is a basic ill sketch 
also runs desktop, also 
runs android in exactly way 
so, im going to start creating a 
running version desktop, so you 
see 
to give you a, a reminder 
that works 
using javascript 
so, im hovering 
mouse, little bit that says 
javascript 
you click in top right, 
righthand corner processing ide, 
you see says java, andriod, 
javascript, experimental 
i dont really know experimental 
means 
going to try today 
going to try javascript 
version 
you run it, you press this play 
icon mark already shown you, 
launches web browser 
i think recommending you use 
google chrome this 
now, you able to hear, sound 
see app 
thats app going to look 
later in detail 
crucially, we need to know is 
web address is 
now, you start, you need to make 
sure that youre wireless 
network desktop ios 
device 
people this time 
youre in house, youve got one 
wireless network 
you connect computer to that 
wireless network you also connect 
devices to network 
you really need to that, 
if you dont that, development 
a bit tricky to get started 
okay 
so, i recommend you that first 
if you havent done that, 
so, next thing we need to know is, 
ip address this desktop is, 
desktop is actually serving 
app moment 
later in course, youll serving 
app a web server, even 
storing locally device 
ill show you to that in a moment, 
now, we really need to know 
ip address 
now, a windows machine you this 
going to command line terminal 
typing ip config, will give you 
ip address advice 
a macintosh device, we 
thing 
we go to a terminal 
if i type ifconfig, gives a list, 
you able to see that now, 
gives a list looks like 
ridiculous numbers 
theres a number here, inet 
, thats ip address 
this machine this network 
ive got an ipad here 
im going to launch safari 
im going to go to ip address 
http 
now, thats enough, we also need a 
colon, port number 
port number here is , i know 
this seems like crazy garbage, 
it, i promise you, is nearly 
here you go, gone straight to 
solid painter app 
loaded in, sound, there 
you go 
running ios device 
simple that 
running network 
really simple 
now, i continue to edit that app 
live refresh this page 
so, i change an aspect it, go back 
to code type something else in, 
refresh page will 
come 
one final thing though is useful to 
know, if you want to embed this 
home screen whilest youre developing, 
you hit this little sharing icon 
choose add to home screen 
if you that, itll actually make 
a proper bundled app 
well talking that later 
towards end course 
that, less, is you get 
running ios device 
i want to point that 
template, weve prepared you, 
is downloadable coursera site 
that look identical a ios 
device whether an ipad, an iphone 
an iphone
