1
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:18,982
[SOUND]. 
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:20,837
Okay. 
So you've done some graphics. 

3
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:26,730
And now you're ready to do some sound. 
So I'm going to begin by showing you how 

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,600
to obtain some sounds. 
[INAUDIBLE] you get get sounds from 

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,349
pretty much anywhere. 
for example, you can record them yourself 

6
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:41,370
or you can obtain them from a website. 
Freesound.org is a really useful website 

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,381
for obtaining sounds. 
They have a wide selection of different 

8
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:49,120
sound effects, ambient sounds, and music. 
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to 

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,330
quickly make a sound myself by recording 
it. 

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,270
I'm going to use the open source audio 
editing software Audacity, which you can 

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,166
see here. 
So, I start with an empty page, I hit 

12
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,810
Record. 
[SOUND] I get my drumstick [NOISE] 

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,181
[SOUND]. 
So this is the bit of the sound that I'm 

14
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:14,666
interested in, so I copy that. 
Paste it into a new sound. 

15
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:23,550
Now because, because we're operating in 
mono here, we're, we're trying to keep 

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,700
the audio library as simple as possible. 
So we operate in mono. 

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,390
So I'm going to record my sound, like 
this, in stereo, but then bounce it to 

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,850
mono. 
So I go into the track menu, stereo track 

19
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,495
to mono. 
Now I'm ready to export. 

20
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:46,130
I'm going to store it into the data 
folder of the sketch. 

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:53,020
So you'll notice when you create a sketch 
like this one and save it that it puts 

22
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,660
data folder for you. 
So my sketch is called Android Start, and 

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,060
you can see I have a data folder in 
there. 

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,340
If it's not there, when you've just saved 
your sketch, you can just create it. 

25
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,510
The data folder is for additional files 
that you want to use in your sketch. 

26
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,520
In this case, audio files. 
So I'm going to save this audio file I 

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,690
just recorded into the data folder of the 
sketch. 

28
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:28,816
[SOUND] And I'm going to call it uh, 
[SOUND] ping.wav. 

29
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:33,160
[SOUND] Okay. 
So we've recorded our own sound. 

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,560
And now we're ready to see if we can get 
it to play on the mobile device. 

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,750
We're going to play a sound on the mobile 
device. 

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,840
In order to do this, we need to write in 
some, some lines of code to initialize 

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,960
the audio environment. 
The audio environment in this case is 

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,860
called Maxin/?. 
This is our custom audio library. 

35
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,930
[SOUND] So Maxim, so I created a variable 
called Maxim, which has the type Maxim. 

36
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,400
We'll worry more about the details of 
types later on in the course. 

37
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,170
Then, I need an audio player. 
Audio player, so that's the type, and 

38
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll call it Player. 
So I've two variables ready to store 

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,730
these two object which I'm now going to 
create. 

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,290
So maxim equals new maxim, that creates a 
new, a new audio environment. 

41
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,040
You only ever need to create a single 
audio environment for your whole sketch, 

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,950
and everything operates within that 
single environment. 

43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,010
Following that, I'm going to ask maxim to 
create my audio platform, player equals 

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,723
maxim .LoadFile, and I pass it the name 
of the file I just saved, ping.wav. 

45
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:45,312
Okay? 
And so, remember, ping.wav is the name of 

46
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:51,229
the file you just created, and it needs 
to be saved in the Data folder, so that 

47
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:55,130
the, so that Maxim can see it. 
because otherwise it, you can only access 

48
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,790
files in that Data folder. 
Okay, and finally, [SOUND] I'm going to 

49
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,870
set up an event, so that when they click 
on the screen or tap on the screen, they 

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,600
will be able to hear the sounds. 
So I'll just say player.play in there. 

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,918
So let's just try this out. 
So I've written my really simple sketch 

52
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:18,841
here. 
Let's just [UNKNOWN] go through that code 

53
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,839
again. 
We've got these two variables, one of 

54
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,674
which is the maxim, that's the audio 
environment that all of the, that deals 

55
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:28,017
with all of the audio processing. 
Audio player represents a single player 

56
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,964
which can play an audio file. 
[SOUND] Maxim is being created there in 

57
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:35,880
the setup function, and the player has 
been created, too. 

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,840
When they click the mouse, this function 
gets called, mouse pressed during the 

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,740
case of the touch screen device when they 
tap on the screen, and it will trigger 

60
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,302
play on the player object, which will 
cause the sound to play. 

61
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:55,263
I'm now going to run the sketch. 
Okay the sketch has launched on the 

62
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:58,399
device, so I tap the screen. 
[SOUND]. 

63
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:08,138
Okay, so you can now hear me hitting the 
table, playing from my Android device. 

64
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:13,481
So to exit the sketch, you need only 
press the Back button. 

65
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:18,576
Like that, and now it's stopped. 
Now, you noticed that it kept playing the 

66
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,358
sound. 
Because the default setting for the 

67
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:25,563
player is to loop the sound. 
So, for example, if you put a drum beat 

68
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:29,490
in there, it will loop it. 
And that's really useful for drum beats. 

69
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,050
But for for a sound effect like this you 
might not want it to loop. 

70
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,250
But before we look at that, let's just 
see what it sounds like when you play a 

71
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,940
drum beat in there. 
So I've already, I've already prepared a 

72
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,173
drum beat called mybeat.wav. 
Okay. 

73
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,790
So let's just see if we can play that on 
the, the device as well. 

74
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,680
So mybeat.wav. 
So I've just changed the, the file. 

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,510
Now remember that file. 
Oops, that, that file needs to be in the 

76
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:56,680
data folder. 
As you can see it's in the data folder of 

77
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,480
my sketch there. 
So I hit play again, and it will build 

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,830
the sketch again and send it over to the 
device. 

79
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,275
And then, when I hit the mouse button, 
you'll be able to hear the break beat. 

80
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:25,260
Okay, the device is ready. 
[MUSIC] So remember because it's looping, 

81
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,410
it's going to keep playing until you tell 
it to stop. 

82
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,030
So what've we done here? 
So we've created an audio file by 

83
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,610
recording it, but you can also obtain 
audio files from this FreeSound website. 

84
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,919
And I didn't exactly show you that. 
But if you don't want to freeze out, you 

85
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,090
can see, so you want it to find a break 
beat of your own. 

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,430
You can type break beat into there, into 
the search box, and you'll have to create 

87
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,110
an account before you can search and, and 
download files, but you can, it's pretty 

88
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,110
easy to do. 
You just do it by clicking on the account 

89
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,970
creation button at the top. 
Okay. 

90
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,690
So I've searched for Break Beat, and I've 
been given all of these files. 

91
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,440
And when you go into the file, you'll see 
that there's a download button. 

92
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
So if you want to get your own Break Beat 
into there, instead of using my one you 

93
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,530
can, you can download there. 
But you will need to load into Audacity, 

94
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:23,286
and exporters of monoware, as I showed 
you before, with my recorded sound. 

95
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,880
[SOUND]. 
So, we've, we've obtained some sounds, 

96
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,755
and we've learned about different types 
of sounds. 

97
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:31,120
And, we've set up the audio assistant to 
play a sound. 

98
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,700
And, we've had a little look of what, 
what looping is about. 

99
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,310
But you can actually control the looping 
properties of the, the audio player like 

100
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,590
this. 
So if I go into here, back again, I can 

101
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,020
tell it not to loop the files, so if I go 
back to my ping thing, which we didn't 

102
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,200
want to repeat, we just wanted it to play 
once, then I just do player.set looping, 

103
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
and set it to false, which says don't 
loop. 

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,050
Just play once. 
The thing is, I now need, you'll see that 

105
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,860
plays once, if I, if I do that. 
But if I wanted to play it again, I'll 

106
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,120
need to call Queue, because that will 
rewind it, back again. 

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,270
So once it's played, it's like a tape 
that's played to the end. 

108
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,820
You have to rewind it again to trigger it 
again. 

109
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
play it. 

110
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,990
And, in fact, I'm going to put it the 
other way around. 

111
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,670
So I'll queue it up to zero, then I'll 
play it. 

112
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,920
So I'm just going to run this sketch, and 
we'll see what it does. 

113
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,360
[SOUND] So it's ready. 
So we're going to hit the mouse button. 

114
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,159
[SOUND] You can hear it plays at once. 
If we hit it again. 

115
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,520
[SOUND] Can you hear it plays again? 
It's not looping because I told it not 

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,750
to. 
[SOUND]. 

117
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,830
Next week you're going to find out more 
about the details of how audio is 

118
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,360
represented in the computer's memory. 
But for now that gives you the basic 

119
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,588
tools that you need to create audio files 
and play them and control that playback. 

120
00:08:55,588 --> 00:09:05,474
In your sketches. 
[MUSIC]
