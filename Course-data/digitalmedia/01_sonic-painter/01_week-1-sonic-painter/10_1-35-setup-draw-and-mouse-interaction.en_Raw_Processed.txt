in this video im going 
to look five things 
dont worry, 
going to take long 
first all, im going to 
a quick chat is a function 
going to look 
setup function 
draw function in processing 
going to find we make 
animation looking mouse interaction 
going to look we 
use mouse interaction in another way, 
using mousedragged function 
so, first all, is a function 
well a function is simply a way 
creating a block code 
going to run later in time 
okay, so instead something 
like this, we call background 
actually, background is a function, right 
calling background, 
defining background is, 
telling to run 
so going to in this 
video is actually define functions 
functions going to 
define called setup draw, 
special 
functions in processing 
run automatically 
okay, so whereas, 
think that background function 
wasnt run automatically 
run we told to, 
writing background 
setup is actually going 
to run automatically 
difference is we to tell 
to in that setup function 
so normal thing you would in 
that setup function is set size 
window 
so remember size, 
youve got width, height 
to remind that thats 
width thats height 
you typically in 
draw function is drawing, 
hence name 
so you set things in setup function 
you draw things in draw function 
so we drawing 
im going to sort 
really illustrate whats 
going functions 
hello setup, okay, 
here im going to say, this is, 
if you like simplest way 
to illustrate whats going 
so, going to is 
set size window 
print that draw is 
going to print hello draw 
so lets play see happens 
so this area here is called 
console whenever you call 
print things go there 
really useful debugging 
so if you want to test a value is 
something like that 
so lets whiz to top 
whats come in console 
youve probably noticed 
already that draw is 
obviously run lots times 
whereas set up, you see 
calling setup code 
so, setup gets called 
beginning sketch runs 
draw is automatically 
called repeatedly 
thats trick to animations 
so, if you think animation, 
basically a series frames 
different stuff in 
thats exactly draw allows us 
to time draw gets called 
we draw a different 
frame animation, 
update picture thats screen 
okay, so lets try that 
im going to is bring in that 
idea, idea mouse movement 
im going to use mouse 
to actually draw something 
so weve seen this rect function 
so remember x, y, width height 
four variables, 
four numbers that we 
parse rect function 
so if i put ,, 
goes to top left screen 
lets say i want a width 
height , 
so lets run that 
thats interesting, 
you imagine is basically 
redrawing rectangle top 

little bit boring 
happens if instead 
setting x y to always , 
if we set x 
y to mouse position 
mousex mousey 
so two special variables here 
give us access to position 
mouse currently 
you imagine, if you move 
mouse around, theyll change 
so if draw gets called again, 
itll update 
so lets try that 
so if i move mouse around, 
you see rectangle appears 
to following 
draw draws top 
previous canvas that there, 
doesnt wipe time, you 
see that whatever drawn is 
kept makes 
a nice kind drawing effect here 
course, if we want to wipe it, 
we could call 
background functions 
remember, background fills entire 
background in a certain color, so 
im going to fill color black, 
is a quick way is zero 
that means every time draw gets 
called first thing does, 
wipes everything 
a black background 
we hit play 
you see that now, 
square is following mouse, 
wiping that 
trail squares 
i kind preferred 
previous one to honest 
okay 
now, final thing i wanted to show 
you is mouse track function 
so this is another function 
that gets called automatically 
processing 
this one doesnt called 
like draw 
actually gets called 
mouse is dragged 
so mouse is dragged 
you basically click in sketch 
move mouse around 
so lets illustrate that 
so theres whole sketch there 
theres much to 
ive got rid code 
draw function 
im drawing 
inside mousedragged 
so lets see this one 
youll notice right 
drawing 
if i click window start 
moving mouse, i draw a line 
i draw another one 
so a bit like a kind 
paint program this nice, 
almost fake, 
d effect lines there 
okay, so we done 
weve found setup 
function gets called every time 
sketch runs 
draw function, 
gets called repeatedly 
to use mouse interaction 
to animation in draw 
to use mouse interaction 
basically responding to user clicking 
window 
dragging mouse around
