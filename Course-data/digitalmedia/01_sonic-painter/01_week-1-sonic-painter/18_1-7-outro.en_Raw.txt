okay, so that's the end of week one. 
and a little kind of easy way in. 
and yeah, that was okay. 
it seemed to it seemed to all work. 
but if you've got any questions, we've 
actually got a forum which you can use. 
and they should use the forum. 
right? 
because, there's a lot of our students on 
the forum. 
aren't there? 
 >> yes, so students here at dolsmith 
have been doing several years of this 
kind of work. 
and we'll also be on there from time to 
time, if there are some important 
questions we'll be answering them. 
 >> yeah, so they, they're a creative 
bunch as well. 
aren't they? 
we got sta, people from our creative 
computing program, and also from people 
we know work with you know, our 
colleagues in the art department, and 
also on our masters program too. 
so it's worth you checking out the forums 
and asking questions. 
but what are kind of things can we 
encourage people to do in the coming 
week, before week two? 
what's a good thing to do? 
 >> you might have a look at some of the 
pr-, the capabilities of processing. 
look at the processing reference. 
i got a link, a link up there on the 
coursera website. 
 >> what about sound-wise, what's a good 
thing? 
 >> well, you just gotta get out there, 
and record some sounds. 
get out, get out, get out away from the 
computer. 
go out and, and record some sounds. 
 >> yeah. 
 >> and load them in, and just play 
around with those parameters we've 
already shown you. 
we've shown you how to slow things down, 
and speed things up. 
 >> yeah. 
 >> you can, there's so much detail in, 
in the recorded sound, that you can 
really have a lot of fun just exploring 
that. 
 >> yeah, and if you start filtering and 
stuff like that, it kind of really comes 
alive. 
 >> exactly. 
 >> and there's loads of different ways 
you can do some interaction, and stuff 
like that. 
so okay, that sounds good. 
so that's what we're going to do. 
there's some stuff that you can do, you 
have to do, and there's some assessment 
type behavior and things you can look out 
for. 
but we're going to see you next week. 
next week we're going to be doing a dj/vj 
type app. 
and there's a lot more sound and a lot 
more graphic and direction and 
specifically video. 
so we'll see you there.
