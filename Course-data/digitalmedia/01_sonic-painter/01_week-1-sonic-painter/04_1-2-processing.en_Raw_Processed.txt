this course, well using a 
programming environment called 
processing, developed mit 
a fantastic environment to learn to 
program in, in particular a 
fantastic environment in to create 
a program in, makes 
simple beginning to 
highly graphical, audiobased, 
interactive software 
this is processing window in 
you run processing program 
first thing youll notice is theres 
a nice play button 
if we hit play, we get a program 
a instant program, a 
small window doesnt really 
anything 
thats surprising, we havent written 
anything to put in code 
this main editor window is we write 
codes im going to give an example 
codes that you might want to write 
so im going to set size 
screen two numbers set 
background color 
ill come back later to exactly 
things mean 
we need to know that weve 
changed size screen, made 
bigger 
weve gone changed background 
to red 
next couple weeks, well 
looking much complicated 
programs that really use full power 
processing, now, i wanted to 
show you to write a simple 
program 
an important part this course is that 
writing processing 
programs desktop, processing 
used mobile devices, android 
devices, ios devices, web 
in a minute, mathew mick 
going to show you to that 
mick is going to go a 
complex example that going to 
explain throughout course this 
weeks lecture 
last thing i want to say is that if 
youre used to programming 
experience in java youll find 
processing familiar 
based java 
even if you programmed in 
say javascript php wont 
hard to learn 
if youve never done programming 
dont worry 
a look additional 
lectures ive posted that will introduce 
programming beginning
