[MUSIC]. 
For this course, we'll be using a 

2
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:24,528
programming environment called 
Processing, developed at MIT. 

3
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:28,176
It's a fantastic environment to learn to 
program in, but in particular it's a 

4
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:31,938
fantastic environment in which to create 
a program in, because it makes it very 

5
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:35,415
simple from the very beginning to do 
highly graphical, audio-based, and 

6
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:41,060
interactive software. 
This is the Processing window in which 

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,550
you run the Processing program. 
The first thing you'll notice is there's 

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,530
a nice Play button. 
If we hit Play, we get a program. 

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,530
It's not a very instant program, it's a 
very small window and it doesn't really 

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,870
do anything. 
That's not surprising, we haven't written 

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,550
anything to put in the code. 
This main editor window is where we write 

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,620
codes and I'm going to give an example of 
some codes that you might want to write. 

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,810
So I'm going to Set the size of the 
screen with two numbers and set the 

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,640
background color. 
I'll come back later to exactly what 

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,180
these things mean. 
But for now we need to know that we've 

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,338
changed the size of the screen, made it 
bigger. 

17
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:24,455
And we've gone and changed the background 
to red. 

18
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:28,490
Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be 
looking at some much more complicated 

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,120
programs that really use the full power 
of processing, but for now, I wanted to 

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,160
show you how to write a very simple 
program. 

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,200
An important part of this course is that 
it's not just about writing processing 

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,840
programs for the desktop, but processing 
can be used on mobile devices, android 

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,990
devices, iOS devices, and on the Web. 
And in a minute, Mathew and Mick are 

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,310
going to show you how to do that. 
And Mick is going to go through a more 

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,290
complex example that we're going to 
explain throughout the course of this 

26
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,240
weeks lecture. 
The last thing I want to say is that if 

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
you're used to programming and have had 
some experience in Java you'll find 

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,310
processing very familiar because it's 
based on Java. 

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,620
But even if you have programmed before in 
say JavaScript or PHP it won't be too 

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,140
hard to learn. 
If you've never done any programming 

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,370
before don't worry. 
But have a look at some of the additional 

32
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,120
lectures I've posted that will introduce 
programming from the very beginning
