sound 
so today im going to introduce 
basics to write computer programs 
that draw pictures that you 
interact 
first thing you need to you 
want to write, draw an image a 
computer program is turn image 
a set numbers 
a certain level, numbers 
computers understand 
if you think a computer screen, 
composed millions pixels 
picture elements 
tiny little squares, 
color 
you think screen a 
large grid pixels 
you see slides here 
first thing you need to know 
youre drawing something to screen is 
particular pixel youre drawing to 
collection pixels, you need to 
able to express that a number 
so, we that 
first thing we is we a number 
that represents many pixels across 
you 
thats horizontal position we 
call x value 
we also need to know many pixels 
you 
vertical position y value 
two numbers give us a position a 
pixel 
example , gives us this pixel here 
shown in red 
so, two numbers we get a single 
pixel value 
so lets a look that in practical 
program 
so this is program, i showed you 
earlier 
weve got size 
weve got background, we draw 
a point a certain position 
say , 
you probably cant even see point, 
actually here, if you see mouse 
position im clicking 
cant you see 
pixels tiny, lets 
something else we proceed make 
point a little bit bigger 
we use this command called stroke weight 
gives you width lines you 
draw size points 
set that to six going to 
get something a little bit bigger 
there we go we clearly see a 
single point screen 
now, creating images individual 
points is going to hard work 
so, lets look to make 
basic shapes 
okay, so here we pixel 
position , , another point given 
another two numbers, say, , 
we draw a line 
so, four numbers, x y 
start position, x y n 
position, we draw a line 
similarly another full numbers we 
go draw a rectangle, 
difference that first 
two positions top left position 
rectangle two 
numbers a position 
rectangle, height width 
so lets another look trying to 
draw complex 
if, instead here, point, we use 
command line, we draw a line to , 
see that looks like 
there we a line 
similarly, rect command gives us a 
rectangle 
here instead a, end position 
line second two points, 
height width 
rectangle 
so im making a square, equal 
height width 
so there we 
lets a quick look ive 
done 
so here we are, two commands 
ive written 
size commands 
is size command 
i showed that in introduction lecture 
to processing, i didnt really talk 

well, in size, youre passing in 
numbers 
first number is x, is width, 
processing window youre creating 
second number is height, y 
value 
similarly a line first number is 
x position, horizontal position 
is start point 
hot vertical position, y 
position is, is start point, 
x y positions end point 
line 
so simple, four numbers, you 
draw a line 
there, you get many 
complex shapes 
next thing you might want to look 
is colors 
so to weve drawing black 
lines 
we represent color numbers 
well, if we start black white 
color coming a computer monitor 
is really amount light that is 
emitted pixel 
screen 
so we think brightness 
a particular pixel, a value 
that we measure 
we measure that brightness 
maximum value, is white , 
is color coming off, is 
black 
if you look here, is black 
we use value 


well, that happens to largest 
value you fit in bits 
so ones on, in computer memory 
value in between two will give 
you gray lighter, darker gray 
so you shay, shades 
variations gray value between 
two values 
fine, thats brightness, 
real color 
well, to talk colors, we need 
to think primary colors, if 
you 
a young age school, you will 
learned that you make color 
mixing three colors paint together 
actually working paint 
working light, thats 
slightly different 
primary colors different, 
concept is same, primary colors 
we green, blue red 
color made 
three, three basic colors 
is that 
a fundamental property light, 
a fundamental property 
eye 
we three types receptor in 
eye, that sensitive to green, red, 
blue parts spectrum 
and, if light comes between 
colors, will trigger 
a mixture say, red green 
components receptors eye 
therefore we fool eye by, instead 
a color thats between green 
red, sending green red 
time will look like a mix 
green red, is yellow 
similarly, green blue is cyan red 
blue is magenta, color 
mixed basic primary colors 
thats great a computer graphics 
point view, we need three 
numbers to represent color, a red 
value, a green value a blue value 
so we use colors 
well, theres a number ways in 
you use colors 
if we look here weve got a basic 
rectangle we change 
that rectangle 
well, first that we change 
rectangle is border 
rectangle we use stroke commands 
stroke means color line that 
we use to draw lines screen 
we also change center 
rectangle using fill command 
fill is color that is used to draw 
center shape, middle 
shape, that drawing screen 
weve already seen background 
command, ill show you that 
the, changes background 
color screen 
last command that ive already shown 
you that is connected is stroke weight 
that doesnt specify color, 
specifies width lines youre 
drawing screen 
so lets a look that in code 
so weve already used background, we 
see here that weve used backgrounds 
, so thats red, green, 
blue 
we see, that came a bright 
red 
if we to change that to zero, 
, we would mix a little blue in 
wed get a different colot 
sort purpley color 
lets try changing these, colors 
this rectangle, so if we use stroke, we 
set color border 
rectangle, lets set to a bright 
green 
sorry, made a mistake there 
we use fill to set sensor 
color 
maybe we use a light blue 
we mix in light blue quite a 
lot red green 
so quite bright 
theres a lot whiteness in there, 
blue 
there we go quite a light blue, we 
could make bluer turning 
red green 
so thats, weve got quite garish 
colors here 
i wouldnt actually make an application 
colors, shows you sort 
you mix, mix basic 
colors 
one last thing i want to show you is 
that youll called stroke fill, 
values continue everything else 
you draw, so if i draw another rectangle 
eh, will colors 
so putting in a second fill command, i 
change color second vector 
okay, theres one last thing id like to 
say color, is to talk 
transparency 
sometimes youre specifying colors 
well red, green, blue, youll 
get a fourth number 
this is opacity 
often called alpha 
opacity controls transparent 
something is 
actually opposite 
transparency 
so opacity is , means 
transparent all, , 
completely transparent 
so, to get colors partially 
transparent, you need an alpha value 
between 
so, example, , , , is half 
transparent red 
we see this in code here, 
setting alpha this rectangle to 
, move slightly so that 
overlaps original, original 
rectangle 
we dont want to completely overlap 
you see is partially 
transparent 
color is affecting whats beneath it, 
completely 
mick will show you nice examples 
you use transparency to get 
really nice visual effects 
so, ive shown you so far, you 
make nice drawings 
computer codes, thats cool 
far goes 
really a computer program 
yet is drawing a 
picture 
you think a computer program you 
want to interact 
to things independently 
so if we look program is 
to 
pressing play, running 
code 
finish, will draw a 
picture we look 
thats we, you complete a 
program , we want to able to interact 
that code 
so we this splitting a code 
news number bit 
first off, we we stuff that 
never change 
example, size screen, 
background color 
always stay 
inaudible thats we call 
setup part program 
theres stuff that 
change, so example, things that 
drawing, like lines, 
move around based 

thats drawing part program 
we put in two different blocks 
code 
first one we put in a block code 
called setup i wont get full 
details everything means here 
if youre familiar java, you will 
understand 
if not, look additional 
lectures 
void setup is whats called a 
function, that contains code 
that we beginning 
program happens 
important thing to note here 
curly brackets 
say tell you start 
end setup code is 
similarly, we functions 
happen times response to certain 
events 
so example, i alpha function 
mousedragged 
mousedragged is that happens 
every time you move mouse while 
mouse button is held hold 
a useful function interaction 
so happens is i move mouse, 
i give input, mouse drag responds 
i play paints a picture 
i see that 
thats fine, if you look code 
is now, every time i call mouse 
dragged, drawing line 
numbers in there arent 
changing 
i need to put in different numbers to 
line in order to change interaction 
im getting make truly 
interactive, to make respond to 
mouse movements 
this is i 
rather putting a number in there, 
im putting in value mouse x mouse y 
pmouse x pmouse y 
things 
well variables names 
stand numbers if youre familiar 
term variable 
if youre you look 
additional lectures 
mouse x mouse y automatically 
set to current position mouse 
so this is mouse position an x 
y value 
pmouse x pmousey useful 
values 
give you previous position 
mouse thats enables us to 
some, smooth drawing 
ill show you that in a minute 
so lets look code that 
this 
so this is basic 
interactive code you get in 
processing 
we a setup function that sets 
size screen background 
color, a mouse drag function that 
draws a point that position is 
mouse 
so lets see that 
weve got a nice little drawing 
thats nice, but, i draw, id like 
to actually sort draw continuous 
lines, we that code i 
showed you, we draw a 
line previous mouse position to 
current mouse position 
noise there we are, nice 
continuous lines drawn 
now, weve got a nice bit interaction 
doesnt look great, theres a lot 
we this aesthetically to 
make 
in a few minutes well talk to you 
that 
now, thats want to say, 
what, im going to say 
i want to show you one little trick 
background function 
so moment 
every time i draw, drawing top 
ive already drawn 
sometimes thats we want 
sometimes what, thats we dont 
we want 
if i move function background 
mouse dragged well setting 
background color background is 
clears screen 
so if i move mouse dragged its, 
clearing screen so ive 
longer accumulated drawings ive 
ever done 
i get this tiny little try 
mouse 
maybe exactly we want 
theres lots situations 
is exactly we want 
next week well show you that in 
detail 
so, so far weve got is ability 
to draw basic energies to screen 
basic shapes interact that 
responding to mouse position 
theres a lot we, you while 
youre drawing, i would recommend 
that you look processing 
website, processingorg 
theres a link to 
call server site, particularly 
look processing reference look 
examples shapes 
a good example is to look ellipse 
command so far weve looked lines, 
rectangles 
ellipse shows you to draw ellipses, 
circles, and, that, thats 
already part repertoire, 
will already, will also start you 
learning to use reference for, 
processing, pick up, use new 
commands that will enable you to 
complex drawing 
so ill leave you here matthew will 
talk a bit to audio 
processing in processing mick 
will show you complex examples using 
basis, basic code that weve learned 
here
