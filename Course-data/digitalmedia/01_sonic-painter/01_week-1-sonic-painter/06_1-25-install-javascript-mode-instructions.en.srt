00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,240
Okay.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,380
Just quick video to show you how to
install JavaScript mode in processing.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,430
So if you look on this menu here, you're

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,960
going to click Java when you first install
it.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,266
So you click add mode, select JavaScript

6
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:20,330
mode, hit the install button, downloads
and installs.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:20,750
We're done.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,021
Now we need to quit processing.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,997
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:32,534
Revamp processing.

11
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:33,730
And there it is.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,060
We can now go to JavaScript mode.
