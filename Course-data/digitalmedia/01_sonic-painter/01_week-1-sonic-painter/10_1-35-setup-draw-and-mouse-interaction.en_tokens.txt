in
this
video
i
'm
going
to
look
at
five
things
.
but
do
n't
worry
,
it
's
not
going
to
take
me
too
long
.
first
of
all
,
i
'm
just
going
to
have
a
quick
chat
about
what
is
a
function
.
then
we
're
going
to
look
at
the
setup
function
and
the
draw
function
in
processing
.
we
're
going
to
find
out
how
we
can
make
animation
by
looking
at
mouse
interaction
.
then
we
're
going
to
look
at
how
we
can
use
mouse
interaction
in
another
way
,
using
the
mousedragged
function
.
so
,
first
of
all
,
what
is
a
function
?
well
a
function
is
simply
a
way
of
creating
a
block
of
code
which
we
're
going
to
run
later
in
time
.
okay
,
so
instead
of
just
something
like
this
,
where
we
call
background
.
actually
,
background
is
a
function
,
right
?
and
we
're
calling
background
,
but
we
're
not
defining
what
background
is
,
we
're
just
telling
it
how
to
run
.
and
so
what
we
're
going
to
do
in
this
video
is
actually
define
some
functions
.
and
the
functions
we
're
going
to
define
are
called
setup
and
draw
,
and
they
are
special
functions
in
processing
.
because
they
are
run
automatically
.
okay
,
so
whereas
,
think
about
that
background
function
.
it
was
n't
being
run
automatically
.
it
was
being
run
because
we
told
it
to
,
by
writing
background
.
but
setup
is
actually
going
to
be
run
automatically
.
the
only
difference
is
we
have
to
tell
it
what
to
do
in
that
setup
function
.
so
the
normal
thing
you
would
do
in
that
setup
function
is
set
the
size
of
the
window
.
so
remember
size
,
you
've
got
the
width
,
height
.
just
to
remind
me
that
that
's
the
width
and
that
's
the
height
.
and
then
what
you
typically
do
in
the
draw
function
is
do
your
drawing
,
hence
the
name
.
so
you
set
things
up
in
the
setup
function
and
you
draw
things
in
the
draw
function
.
so
before
we
do
any
drawing
i
'm
just
going
to
sort
of
just
really
illustrate
what
's
going
on
with
these
functions
.
hello
from
setup
,
okay
,
and
here
i
'm
going
to
say
,
this
is
,
if
you
like
the
simplest
way
to
illustrate
what
's
going
on
.
so
,
all
it
's
going
to
do
is
set
the
size
of
the
window
and
then
print
that
and
then
draw
is
just
going
to
print
out
hello
from
draw
.
so
let
's
play
it
and
see
what
happens
.
so
this
area
down
here
is
called
the
console
and
whenever
you
call
print
things
go
out
into
there
and
it
's
really
useful
for
debugging
.
so
if
you
want
to
test
what
a
value
is
or
something
like
that
.
so
let
's
just
whiz
up
to
the
top
of
what
's
come
out
in
the
console
.
and
you
've
probably
noticed
already
that
draw
is
just
being
obviously
run
lots
of
times
.
whereas
set
up
,
you
see
it
's
only
calling
the
setup
code
once
.
so
,
setup
gets
called
once
at
the
beginning
when
the
sketch
runs
.
draw
is
being
automatically
called
repeatedly
.
and
that
's
the
trick
to
doing
animations
.
so
,
if
you
think
about
animation
,
it
's
basically
a
series
of
frames
with
different
stuff
in
and
that
's
exactly
what
draw
allows
us
to
do
each
time
draw
gets
called
.
we
can
draw
a
different
frame
of
our
animation
,
or
update
the
picture
that
's
on
the
screen
.
okay
,
so
let
's
try
that
.
and
what
i
'm
going
to
do
is
bring
in
that
other
idea
,
the
idea
of
mouse
movement
.
and
i
'm
going
to
use
the
mouse
to
actually
draw
something
.
so
we
've
seen
before
this
rect
function
.
so
remember
x
,
y
,
width
and
height
.
those
are
the
four
variables
,
the
four
numbers
that
we
parse
into
the
rect
function
.
so
if
i
put
it
at
0,0
,
it
goes
to
the
top
left
of
the
screen
.
and
let
's
say
i
want
a
width
and
height
of
25
,
25.
so
let
's
just
run
that
.
that
's
not
very
interesting
,
but
what
you
can
imagine
it
's
doing
is
basically
redrawing
the
rectangle
on
top
of
itself
again
and
again
and
again
.
little
bit
boring
.
but
what
happens
if
instead
of
setting
x
and
y
to
just
always
be
0
,
what
if
we
set
x
and
y
to
be
the
mouse
position
?
mousex
and
mousey
?
so
these
two
special
variables
here
give
us
access
to
the
position
of
the
mouse
currently
.
and
as
you
imagine
,
if
you
move
the
mouse
around
,
they
'll
change
.
so
if
draw
gets
called
again
,
it
'll
update
.
so
let
's
try
that
.
so
if
i
move
my
mouse
around
,
you
can
see
the
rectangle
appears
to
be
following
it
and
because
because
draw
just
draws
on
top
of
the
previous
canvas
that
was
there
,
it
does
n't
wipe
it
each
time
,
you
can
see
that
whatever
it
's
drawn
before
is
being
kept
which
makes
for
a
nice
kind
of
drawing
effect
here
.
now
of
course
,
if
we
did
want
to
wipe
it
,
we
could
just
call
the
background
functions
.
now
remember
,
background
fills
the
entire
background
in
a
certain
color
,
so
i
'm
going
to
fill
it
with
the
color
black
,
which
is
a
quick
way
of
doing
it
is
zero
.
that
means
every
time
draw
gets
called
the
first
thing
it
does
,
it
wipes
everything
over
with
a
black
background
.
then
we
hit
play
.
and
you
can
see
that
now
,
the
square
is
just
following
the
mouse
,
and
it
's
wiping
out
that
trail
of
other
squares
.
i
kind
of
preferred
the
previous
one
to
be
honest
.
okay
.
now
,
the
final
thing
i
wanted
to
show
you
is
the
mouse
track
function
.
so
this
is
another
function
that
gets
called
automatically
.
by
processing
.
but
this
one
does
n't
just
called
again
and
again
like
draw
does
.
it
actually
gets
called
when
the
mouse
is
being
dragged
.
so
the
mouse
is
being
dragged
when
you
basically
click
in
the
sketch
and
move
the
mouse
around
.
so
let
's
just
illustrate
that
.
so
there
's
the
whole
sketch
there
.
there
's
not
much
to
it
.
i
've
got
rid
of
the
code
from
the
draw
function
and
i
'm
just
doing
my
drawing
inside
mousedragged
now
.
so
let
's
see
what
this
one
does
.
you
'll
notice
right
now
it
's
not
doing
any
drawing
.
if
i
click
on
the
window
and
start
moving
my
mouse
,
then
i
can
draw
a
line
.
then
i
can
draw
another
one
.
so
it
's
a
bit
like
a
kind
of
paint
program
with
this
nice
,
almost
fake
,
3-d
effect
on
the
lines
there
.
okay
,
so
what
have
we
done
?
we
've
just
found
out
about
the
setup
function
which
gets
called
once
every
time
your
sketch
runs
.
the
draw
function
,
which
gets
called
repeatedly
and
how
to
use
mouse
interaction
to
do
animation
in
draw
.
and
how
to
use
mouse
interaction
basically
responding
to
the
user
clicking
into
the
window
and
dragging
the
mouse
around
.
