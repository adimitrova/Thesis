1
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,534
[SOUND]. 
Okay, so one of the first things we have 

2
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:25,992
to learn how to do is to run applications 
on mobile devices. 

3
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,392
now Matt will have already shown you how 
to run stuff on Android, and Marco will 

4
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,770
have shown you how to run stuff off the 
desktop. 

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,056
I'm going to show you how you can run the 
same application, using our code that 

6
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:39,183
we've prepared for you, in the download 
pack which is off, which is from 

7
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:43,380
Coursera. 
So that you can do exactly the same code, 

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,140
write the same code, and have it run on 
all three devices, specifically on, on 

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,871
iOS device. 
Now, crucially, the way we're doing this 

10
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:57,168
as part of this program, is we're running 
all of the iOS-specific code as 

11
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,840
JavaScript. 
So, when you finish making your 

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,410
application, you press Go and it builds a 
webpage specifically for our iOS mobile 

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,500
device. 
There's a couple of little tricky things 

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,960
that we need to get right the first time 
we do it, and I'm going to talk you 

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,450
through those right now. 
But firstly, we start with a 

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,990
straightforward sketch. 
Now, I'm going to use a sketch that 

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,410
we're, we're going to talk about later on 
in lesson one, called Sonic Painter. 

18
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,570
And this is just a basic I'll sketch. 
It also runs on the desktop, and it also 

19
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:39,430
runs on Android in exactly the same way. 
So, I'm going to start by creating a 

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,130
running version on my desktop, so you can 
see. 

21
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,270
Just to give you a, a reminder of how 
that works. 

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,260
But we're using JavaScript. 
So, I'm just hovering over with the 

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,588
mouse, over the little bit that says 
JavaScript. 

24
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:56,360
When you click in the top right, 
right-hand corner of the processing IDE, 

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,580
you can see it says Java, Andriod, 
Javascript, Experimental. 

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,920
I don't really know what Experimental 
means. 

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,850
We're not going to try it out today. 
But we're going to try the JavaScript 

28
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,180
version. 
When you run it, when you press this Play 

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,250
icon as Mark already shown you, it 
launches your web browser. 

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,463
And I think we're recommending you use 
Google Chrome for this. 

31
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:30,510
Now, you should be able to hear, [SOUND]. 
And see the app. 

32
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,740
And that's the app we're going to look at 
later on in more detail. 

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,360
But crucially, what we need to know is 
what the web address is. 

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,430
Now, before you start, you need to make 
sure that you're on the same wireless 

35
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,400
network as your desktop on your iOS 
device. 

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,830
Most people do this all the time. 
When you're in your house, you've got one 

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,490
wireless network. 
And you connect your computer to that 

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,230
wireless network and you also connect all 
your devices to the same network. 

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,070
But you really need to do that, because 
if you don't do that, development can be 

40
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,210
a bit tricky to get started with. 
Okay? 

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,880
So, I recommend you do that first. 
If you haven't done that, do it now. 

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,311
So, the next thing we need to know is, 
what the IP address of this desktop is, 

43
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:18,470
because the desktop is actually serving 
the app at the moment. 

44
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,350
Later on in the course, you'll be serving 
the app from a web server, and even 

45
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,898
storing it locally on your device. 
I'll show you how to do that in a moment, 

46
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:30,110
but for now, we really need to know the 
IP address. 

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:36,190
Now, on a Windows machine you can do this 
by going to the command line terminal and 

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,720
typing IP config, and it will give you 
the IP address of your advice. 

49
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,505
On a Macintosh device, we can do the same 
thing. 

50
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:52,720
We can go to a terminal. 
If I type ifconfig, it gives me a list, 

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,550
and you should be able to see that now, 
it gives me a list of what looks like 

52
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,674
ridiculous numbers. 
But there's a number here, inet 

53
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:04,820
192.168.0.108, that's the IP address of 
this machine on this network. 

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,360
I've got an iPad here. 
I'm going to launch Safari. 

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:27,280
And I'm going to go to the IP address. 
Http://192.168.0.108. 

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,204
Now, that's not enough, we also need a 
colon, and the port number. 

57
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:41,100
The port number here is 55523, I know 
this all seems like crazy garbage, but 

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,290
it, I promise you, is nearly over. 
Here you go, and it's gone straight to 

59
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,223
the Solid Painter app. 
And once it's loaded in, [SOUND], there 

60
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:56,131
you go. 
It's running on my iOS device. 

61
00:04:56,131 --> 00:05:01,079
Simple as that. 
It's running over the network. 

62
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,220
Really simple. 
And now, I can continue to edit that app 

63
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,010
live and just refresh this page. 
So, I can change an aspect of it, go back 

64
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,030
to the code type something else in, and 
then refresh the page and it will then 

65
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,390
come up. 
One final thing though which is useful to 

66
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,392
know, if you want to embed this on your 
home screen whilest you're developing, 

67
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:28,392
you can hit this little sharing icon and 
choose add to home screen. 

68
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:31,965
And if you do that, it'll actually make 
it a proper bundled app. 

69
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,282
We'll be talking more about that later on 
towards the end of the course. 

70
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:39,140
But that, more or less, is how you get it 
running on your iOS device. 

71
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,241
And I just want to point out that our 
template, which we've prepared for you, 

72
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:48,870
is downloadable from the Coursera site. 
And that should look identical on a iOS 

73
00:05:48,870 --> 00:06:00,866
device whether it's an iPad, an iPhone 5 
or an iPhone 4.
