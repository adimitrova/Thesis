Hi, welcome to Lesson 1 of Creative 

2
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:23,429
Programming for Digital Media and Mobile 
Apps. 

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,211
I'm Mick, and this is Matt and Marco. 
And we're going to take you through six 

4
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:33,432
individual lessons starting with this 
week, which is all about the basics of 

5
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:40,390
drawing and the basics of sound. 
So, first of all, we need to know how to 

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,780
manipulate graphics and draw them to the 
screen and we also need to know how 

7
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,500
images are represented on the screen. 
Marco is going to take you through that, 

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,460
and he's also going to give you a 
introduction on how to use processing for 

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,150
making desktop applications. 
Matt's going to take you through how to 

10
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,467
control sound and how to find and play 
back sounds from the internet. 

11
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:04,630
He's also going to talk a little bit 
about manipulating sound, and how sound 

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,510
is represented in the computer. 
In addition, he's going to show you a 

13
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,200
little about how to run applications that 
we develop on Android phones. 

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,990
And then, I'm going to take you through 
the basics of using Apple devices. 

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,350
And after that, I'm going to show you how 
to make a basic app with simple 

16
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,350
interactions, like mouse and touch 
interaction. 

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,440
That plays back different sounds in 
different ways. 

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,512
And also changes the way that certain 
types of images are drawn. 

19
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,430
So, that's really what this lesson is 
about. 

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,810
It's kind of easing you in to the whole 
idea of making creative applications. 

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,300
And if you've got any questions, you can 
check the forums. 

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,610
We'll be looking out for any of you who 
have particular issues. 

23
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,610
It's always a bit difficult getting 
started running software for the first 

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,380
time. 
So, we've got a whole load of examples 

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,260
that you can download from the Coursera 
website. 

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,850
We're going to be referring to them 
throughout the next six weeks starting 

27
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,270
this week. 
So, make sure that before you ask 

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,310
questions, you have a look on the 
documentation that we've put on the 

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,030
website. 
There's a lot there. 

30
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,260
There are also people who are going to be 
on the forums, expecting you to ask good, 

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,510
relevant questions. 
And hopefully, if you are stuck, then 

32
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,190
we'll be able to sort that out. 
So I think we're going to start off with 

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,610
Marco. 
I think he's going to do some graphics, 

34
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,830
and then move on to Matt, and then I'll 
be seeing you later on.
