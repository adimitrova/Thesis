1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,560
Okay, so that's the end of Week one. 
And a little kind of easy way in. 

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,070
And yeah, that was okay. 
It seemed to it seemed to all work. 

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,970
But if you've got any questions, we've 
actually got a forum which you can use. 

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,960
And they should use the forum. 
Right? 

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,070
Because, there's a lot of our students on 
the forum. 

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,490
Aren't there? 
 >> Yes, so students here at DOLSMITH 

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,900
have been doing several years of this 
kind of work. 

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,250
And we'll also be on there from time to 
time, if there are some important 

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,900
questions we'll be answering them. 
 >> Yeah, so they, they're a creative 

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,630
bunch as well. 
Aren't they? 

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,600
We got sta, people from our creative 
computing program, and also from people 

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,322
we know work with you know, our 
colleagues in the art department, and 

13
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:40,180
also on our Masters program too. 
So it's worth you checking out the forums 

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,400
and asking questions. 
But what are kind of things can we 

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,490
encourage people to do in the coming 
week, before week two? 

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,780
What's a good thing to do? 
 >> You might have a look at some of the 

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,680
pr-, the capabilities of processing. 
Look at the processing reference. 

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,511
I got a link, a link up there on the 
Coursera website. 

19
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,226
 >> What about sound-wise, what's a good 
thing? 

20
00:00:57,226 --> 00:01:00,270
 >> Well, you just gotta get out there, 
and record some sounds. 

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,990
Get out, get out, get out away from the 
computer. 

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,340
Go out and, and record some sounds. 
 >> Yeah. 

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,660
 >> And load them in, and just play 
around with those parameters we've 

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,970
already shown you. 
We've shown you how to slow things down, 

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,502
and speed things up. 
 >> Yeah. 

26
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,190
 >> You can, there's so much detail in, 
in the recorded sound, that you can 

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,014
really have a lot of fun just exploring 
that. 

28
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,894
 >> Yeah, and if you start filtering and 
stuff like that, it kind of really comes 

29
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:18,470
alive. 
 >> Exactly. 

30
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,060
 >> And there's loads of different ways 
you can do some interaction, and stuff 

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,250
like that. 
So okay, that sounds good. 

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,680
So that's what we're going to do. 
there's some stuff that you can do, you 

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,010
have to do, and there's some assessment 
type behavior and things you can look out 

34
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,880
for. 
But we're going to see you next week. 

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,510
Next week we're going to be doing a DJ/VJ 
type app. 

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,200
And there's a lot more sound and a lot 
more graphic and direction and 

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,725
specifically video. 
So we'll see you there. 

38
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:43,725
