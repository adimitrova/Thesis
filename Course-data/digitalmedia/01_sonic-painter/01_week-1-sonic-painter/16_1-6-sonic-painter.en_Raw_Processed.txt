okay so, lesson one 
getting started understanding graphics 
sound try to make very, 
basic program manipulating 
i want to extend that idea so that 
weve got to firststage application, 
week application 
if you a look intro video 
running an app ios device 
youve seen a little bit this already 
so called sonic painter 
application allows you to draw 
screen makes a series 
shapes time you 
manipulate sounds using very, 
basic functions 
so quite a simple application 
said that, there a number 
applications that available 
web that people pay to use, that arent 
that much complicated this 
key to making look nice is 
really, really good sound 
image integration, so that people really 
feel that interactive 
and, also mapping information one 
domain to other, going to talk 
a little bit to that 
so basic idea is that we draw shapes 
screen, slowly rub 
around 
we different brushes well, 
im going to talk 
you make a gesture to draw a 
shape, plays back manipulates a 
sound 
thats idea behind sonic painter 
so we map information 
mouse to control different aspects 
graphics 
well, we need to think graphics 
parameters specifically 
whole plan is to make something that 
looks much better someone 
wheeling around mouse 
essentially, someone 
wheeling around a mouse 
finger 
to programmer to try make 
look interesting that 
there a couple techniques 
you use, make that much easier 
first one is mapping information 
so we start map command 
using to adjust color 
you see, idea is we take 
mousex position we map between , 
is x equals , is right 
leftmost part screen 
width, so idea that is 
that user moves finger 
here to here, we get a number is 
representative either width 
we map that to a scale 
between , marcos already 
explained, thats range, 
parameter range a color 
now, this using this width 
command, always tells us wide 
application is currently 
mapping in 
so lets a look that in action 
im going to make this really simple 
changing brush to simple 
brush, in fact, going to a 
line 
heres a line i need to sure that 
im actually deleting right line 
there, okay, yeah 
let try run this 
now, youll find is, if i refresh 
this, will pick changes ive 
made without to mess 
much 
we find, yeah 
music theres a single line 
im going to mute a second so 
you cant hear, you see 
im drawing a single line 
youll able to see that desktop 
version well if i refresh this 
a single line is drawn 
so lets go back to code see 
that works 
basically setting here, were, 
going to talk audio in a 
bit detail later 
matts already explained we 
load a sound we play back 
so playing back sound, 
getting red channel mousex 
mapping the, to 
width to a range to 
getting blue, 
mapping mousey, is 
to width to a range 
so that gives us red blue 
weve also got a green 
now, lets a look green 

so green edges less 
green in middle 
we that 
well, we get distance 
center 
dist function in processing allows us 
to get distance 
particular point to another 
point, uses, quite fabulous to 
this basically just, makes a triangle 
figures hypotenuse 
triangle is 
so hypotenuse is, if you a right 
angle triangle, bit that is 
longest item aside 
thats bit we want to work out, 
this one point this 
point 
now, dist function that us 
we give an xy coordinate a 
starting point an xy coordinate an 
ending point 
tells us distance is 
we use that to work 
green color ought to 
so dist this us 
we get mousex mousey, is 
the, mouse finger 
is ipod ipad iphone 
we see far that is 
center is width divided , 
height divided 
so, lets see that works 
so we this, we is 
using that to adjust green 
if we a look app itself, 
you see greener we get away 
center, likewise here 
here 
right 
so weve got a nice mixture red, green 
blue across entire range, across 
entire screen 
we also want to know, well, lets see 
else we 
we get speed 
if we get speed, we use 
distance between previous last 
position current last position, 
thats a good measure speed, 
halfway traveled, right, 
finger 
so we get that distance, that tells 
us fast moving 
simple that 
we also change alpha 
we use speed value that weve got 
to set bright alpha is, so 
transparent drawing is 
so faster we go, 
transparent, sorry, less transparent 
is, slower we go, 
transparent is 
we also set another variable called 
line width, we use speed to 
that 
you see screen here 
that if i go slowly, a fat 
line, if i go fast, a thin line 
also, i might want to constrain line 
width so that doesnt go a 
certain width 
otherwise, i end a really 
big, fat lines, i dont want them, 
simply im going very, 
slowly 
so here, is using a 
function called constrain, 
saying that we want to constrain line 
width, is this variable here to 
between this value this value 
between , so maximum line 
width is always going to 
okay 
so, using techniques, we map 
parameters mouse interaction to 
color 
we get distances mouse 
pointer to different different parts 
screen use that to control 
aspects drawing 
we also constrain certain elements 
certain variables that weve created 
a speed variable, tells us 
far weve traveled between two 
frames 
we make sure that dont 
cause massive changes in program 
so we also different brushes 
now, ive included brushes you 
to a look 
quite complicated 
to you to spend time looking 

theyre complicated 
in fact, sometimes, therell over, a 
little bit edge, theyre 
right theyre to get you 
started 
makes a really good visual app 
is really, really good brushes 
youll know that you use photoshop, 
one thing to drawing a line 
screen 
another thing to able to draw a 
very, pretty pattern 
so brush even an image 
you load 
well, in this case im is im 
using the, basic shapes, 
lesson one 
basic shapes that comes 
processing, circles rectangles 
lines 
to give you an indication 
cool things you very, 
limited material, to you to 
expand that, really 
weve done color, this is 
shape 
so, let show you 
brushes 
ill quickly demonstrate a few 

so brush here, i to is make 
is comment brush, refresh 
apps 
so i refresh 
wait to finish loading 
you see an ipad an iphone, 
theres a little icon 
there you go 
so this is drawing a circle 
youll notice that faster i go, 
if you see that, faster i go, 
bigger circle 
thats a simple idea a brush, 
so now, im going quite slowly ive 
got small circles lines 
still quite thick 
curls less 
ive also got this one, draws 
squares instead, so thing, 
using rectangles 
loading here, you see 
theres a little icon spinning around 
there you go 
this one produces a, one 
square, a whole bunch squares 
i think thats something is really 
important to understand, 
youve got one input, doesnt mean 
you one inputs 
you 
so you take one input map to 
lots others 
ill show you we that in a minute 
ill expand that 
brush is a random selection lines 
so, i draw ipad screen, we 
see, we looks like, i guess 
looks like kind bad tinsel 
i say examples to get 
you started 
get varied thickness 
depending speed you get 
color variation 
theres a few 
you a look 
but, this one is a bit interesting 
this introduces another idea 
symmetry 
now, you use symmetry to easily 
create order something 
doesnt necessarily look like ordered 
in this example, im is im 
getting mouse position drawing 
line way that i in 
very, first approach that i showed 
you 
im also drawing a line 
opposite side in xaxis 
so anything i is mirrored, 
you that, gives illusion that 
somehow intentional 
intentional 
so if you a look, i this 
looks like i a symmetrical 
pattern, i 
thats single, single 
interaction is two interactions that 
mirror other, ive got in sort 
lateral symmetry 
this symmetry is one methods 
that you start to make stuff that 
looks random, look ordered 
symmetry is a cheap way getting 
something beautiful 
layers symmetry that you 
add, often, attractive people 
find things 
always, depends 
personal taste, one 
things you explore if youre 
interested in making, example, 
concentric patterns kind 
abstract patterns flower type shapes 
arrangements 
used time in lots 
different forms art a 
important aspect to computer graphics 
a important way taking 
something simple making 
complicated 
so i want to show you a advanced 
version that symmetry sample 
perhaps eight order symmetry 
thats circles, let make 
sure that right 
thats, actually next 
one 
i known 
yeah, so this is same, 
eight borders symmetry 
youll notice now, we get something 
that looks, that a kind religious 
appeal 
if i turn audio up, we see 
this is going to work 
music im randomly drawing, 
doesnt matter i draw, i get 
symmetrical patterns 
im literally, im paying attention to 
im 
its, coming 
interesting stuff 
thats ive got so many different 
reflections 
if im looking mirrors upon 
mirrors upon mirrors upon mirrors 
cheap trick, powerful 
okay 
last thing i want to talk is 
sound 
ill this quick i can, i 
know you want to get 
really easy to one 
sound, you hear, weve got two 
weve got bells weve also got 
ambient wash 
so im loading two sounds in exactly 
way that matt showing you 
music let mute this while i quickly 
show you 
we is a separate audioplayer, 
audioplayer 
player loads following exactly 
way 
so we one maxim context, we 
two players 
player is loaded here 
we set new ping to true, 
also balancing first time im 
loading, is i must warn is a 
lot louder bells 
so im using volume command to turn 
volume first one 
then, im playing in this 
mouse drag method 
so i, mouse is dragged, 
starts to play sounds that 
silent 
im also a couple cool 
things, im going to talk in 
detail in next lesson, 
thats sound manipulation 
this is a taste unknown 
two things im to make 
interesting is im altering speed, 
you see here, im also altering 
filter 
now, speed is a really simple 
equation im going to quickly show 
you 
player speed here is mousex divided 
width divided 
so wherever that i am, x, so 
to width x divided width times , that 
is fast i want to go 
thats we get lovely 
sounds, lovely sounds 
music there we go 
so i slow that right 
also, ive got a filter ambient 
wash, means 
screen i am, brighter ambient 
wash is 
music im going to explain that in 
detail next week 
so, i think itll a great idea you 
to take this example pick apart, 
add sounds, add 
brushes 
try make something helps 
you understand different aspects 
graphics sound to give you a better 
indication you might move forward 
create an application this type 
uses 
music
