sound 
music 
okay 
so youve done graphics 
youre ready to sound 
so im going to begin showing you 
to obtain sounds 
inaudible you get get sounds 
pretty much anywhere 
example, you record 
you obtain a website 
freesoundorg is a really useful website 
obtaining sounds 
a wide selection different 
sound effects, ambient sounds, music 
im going to is, im going to 
quickly make a sound recording 

im going to use open source audio 
editing software audacity, you 
see here 
so, i start an empty page, i hit 
record 
sound i get drumstick noise 
sound 
so this is bit sound that im 
interested in, so i copy that 
paste a new sound 
because, operating in 
mono here, were, trying to keep 
audio library simple possible 
so we operate in mono 
so im going to record sound, like 
this, in stereo, bounce to 
mono 
so i go track menu, stereo track 
to mono 
im ready to export 
im going to store data 
folder sketch 
so youll notice you create a sketch 
like this one save that puts 
data folder you 
so sketch is called android start, 
you see i a data folder in 
there 
if there, youve saved 
sketch, you create 
data folder is additional files 
that you want to use in sketch 
in this case, audio files 
so im going to save this audio file i 
recorded data folder 
sketch 
sound im going to call uh, 
sound pingwav 
sound okay 
so weve recorded sound 
ready to see if we get 
to play mobile device 
going to play a sound mobile 
device 
in order to this, we need to write in 
some, lines code to initialize 
audio environment 
audio environment in this case is 
called maxin 
this is custom audio library 
sound so maxim, so i created a variable 
called maxim, type maxim 
well worry details 
types later in course 
then, i need an audio player 
audio player, so thats type, 
ill call player 
so ive two variables ready to store 
two object im going to 
create 
so maxim equals new maxim, that creates a 
new, a new audio environment 
you ever need to create a single 
audio environment whole sketch, 
everything operates within that 
single environment 
following that, im going to ask maxim to 
create audio platform, player equals 
maxim loadfile, i pass name 
file i saved, pingwav 
okay 
so, remember, pingwav is name 
file you created, needs 
to saved in data folder, so that 
the, so that maxim see 
otherwise it, you access 
files in that data folder 
okay, finally, sound im going to 
set an event, so that click 
screen tap screen, 
will able to hear sounds 
so ill say playerplay in there 
so lets try this 
so ive written really simple sketch 
here 
lets unknown go that code 

weve got two variables, one 
is maxim, thats audio 
environment that the, that deals 
audio processing 
audio player represents a single player 
play an audio file 
sound maxim is created there in 
setup function, player 
created, 
click mouse, this function 
gets called, mouse pressed 
case touch screen device 
tap screen, will trigger 
play player object, will 
cause sound to play 
im going to run sketch 
okay sketch launched 
device, so i tap screen 
sound 
okay, so you hear hitting 
table, playing android device 
so to exit sketch, you need 
press back button 
like that, stopped 
now, you noticed that kept playing 
sound 
default setting 
player is to loop sound 
so, example, if you put a drum beat 
in there, will loop 
thats really useful drum beats 
a sound effect like this you 
might want to loop 
we look that, lets 
see sounds like you play a 
drum beat in there 
so ive already, ive already prepared a 
drum beat called mybeatwav 
okay 
so lets see if we play that 
the, device well 
so mybeatwav 
so ive changed the, file 
remember that file 
oops, that, that file needs to in 
data folder 
you see in data folder 
sketch there 
so i hit play again, will build 
sketch send to 
device 
then, i hit mouse button, 
youll able to hear break beat 
okay, device is ready 
music so remember looping, 
going to keep playing until you tell 
to stop 
so whatve we done here 
so weve created an audio file 
recording it, you also obtain 
audio files this freesound website 
i didnt exactly show you that 
if you dont want to freeze out, you 
see, so you want to find a break 
beat 
you type break beat there, 
search box, youll to create 
an account you search and, 
download files, you can, pretty 
easy to 
you clicking account 
creation button top 
okay 
so ive searched break beat, ive 
given files 
you go file, youll see 
that theres a download button 
so if you want to get break beat 
there, instead using one you 
can, you download there 
you will need to load audacity, 
exporters monoware, i showed 
you before, recorded sound 
sound 
so, weve, weve obtained sounds, 
weve learned different types 
sounds 
and, weve set audio assistant to 
play a sound 
and, weve a little look what, 
looping is 
you actually control looping 
properties the, audio player like 
this 
so if i go here, back again, i 
tell to loop files, so if i go 
back to ping thing, we didnt 
want to repeat, we wanted to play 
once, i playerset looping, 
set to false, says dont 
loop 
play 
thing is, i need, youll see that 
plays once, if i, if i that 
if i wanted to play again, ill 
need to call queue, that will 
rewind it, back 
so played, like a tape 
thats played to end 
you to rewind to trigger 

so im going to is im going to 
play 
and, in fact, im going to put 
way around 
so ill queue to zero, ill 
play 
so im going to run this sketch, 
well see 
sound so ready 
so going to hit mouse button 
sound you hear plays 
if we hit 
sound you hear plays 
looping i told 
to 
sound 
next week youre going to find 
details audio is 
represented in computers memory 
that gives you basic 
tools that you need to create audio files 
play control that playback 
in sketches 
music
