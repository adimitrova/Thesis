this is first lectures 
people this course 
new to programming 
if youve got programming experience 
youre probably going to to work a 
little bit harder in this course 
will a little bit challenging 
though we will guide you it, 
this, lectures will explain 
major concepts 
also going to put a bunch 
materials that support you 
we talk programming we need 
to think a little bit a 
computer is, in order to understand 
to program 
this is a computer, inside a pc, 
i, i got flickr 
you see messy 
theres lots microchips, theres sort 
motherboards, wires everywhere 
actually we dont really, to program, 
we dont need to know a computer is 
in complexity 
actually we need to know is 
simple things, really we 
need to know two things that make a 
computer 
this is processor 
actually a processor, a 
fan, underneath that fan is 
processor 
processor is thing that 
calculations 
actions 
really is core computer 
main that we need to know 
is memory 
this is we store data 
anything that is, you know, form 
data that we processing in 
computer must go memory 
really a computer 
a computer program is 
processor actions memory, 
memory is composed simple 
output, so its, we call bits 
bit can, is like a switch 

we normally represent that a zero 
a one 
so, really memory is along series 
processor, that is 
simple operations memory 
add two elements memory 
together, multiply mathematical 
operations, simple ones, 
move things around in memory 
thats a little bit compelx 
that, really much all, 
its, you know, what, 
simple things 
so, computers so powerful, if 
is, is, move around add 
together zeroes ones 
well, reason is, memory is 
very, big 
so measured in gigabytes, thats 
billions, american billions of, bytes 
a byte is eight bits 
so theres a lot similarly processes 
summations in gigahurtz essentially 
billions simple 
instructions per second 
so a computer program is really 
a simple things 
very, fast lots 
luckily we dont to think in terms 
very, simple operations that 
can, that processors we we 
want computer to programs 
we turn we call high level 
languages, that have, that combine lots 
lots these, simple 
operations bigger ones 
this still may look readable to 
someone thats new in programming 
you see that, least weve got 
much higher level concepts like 
backgrounds, in background color 
screen, rotating things around, 
drawing images, stuff thats, thats 
least a bit in the, realm 
we think humans 
similarly those, ones zeroes in 
memory, we interpret in many, 
many ways to create many complex forms 
data 
a single bit cant tell us much, 
tell us if something is true 
false 
this kind binary division 
normally you would combine bits 
together complex things, 
basic level calculating numbers 
whole numbers fractional numbers, we 
actually leaps rather differently ill 
come back to that in a later lecture 
text, much complicated 
things like images sound waves 
things essentially 
longer longer strings ones 
zeros this course will cover a little 
bit last two represent 
main merges 
okay so lets try writing a simple 
program 
this is processing 
a piece software 
a program language also a 
piece software writing programs in 
that language 
we this area here we type 
text program 
lets start playing with, pressing 
play button to run program 
here we 
weve got a program, a small 
window, doesnt much, 
thats really surprising 
we havent actually written program 
text 
least even writing nothing there, 
we get a program 
i close program in normal 
way close button, i also 
press stop to stop running, 
we actually try writing something 
okay 
im going to first write this command 
size x 
lets see that 
there we go, weve got a much bigger 
window 
ive, happened here 
well ive called a command size that, 
that does, size is named 
command 
changes size screen 
you need two numbers in order to 
change size screen 
one numbers is width, 
, is height, 
numbers put in brackets, so 
every time youre calling command you 
need brackets 
there commands dont need, any, 
numbers 
we call parameters, parsed in 
we still need brackets 
empty ones, show that 
parsing anything in 
commands separated commas 
end everything we a 
semicolon 
first thing to really notice 
writing new programs youre 
new to programming is that grammar 
punctuation vital, we call 
syntax program 
so computers, in many ways, very, 
stupid so dont understand 
things well, unless youve got very, 
precise punctuations to tell 
to 
needs brackets, so that knows 
calling a command, knows 
values passing 
command, we call parameters 
know, needs those, begin end 
brackets to know parameters 
stop 
needs a comma to know when, parameter 
ended next one started 
needs a semicolon to know one, 
command stopped 
dont things will get you 
inaudible outg 
example, if i leave setting 
unknown gives unexpected token 
null 
doesnt, something hasnt 
understood 
often errors quite hard 
to understand 
so important to quite careful 
okay, lets try another thing 
background , , , there we 
arrange background 
i will do, while slightly 
program that draws a pointed screen, i 
will show this in detail in main 
lecture, might want to take a look 
i that to set position give 
a certain width 
otherwise going to able to 
see effectively 
if you that inaudible 
stroke weight length 
so this is a typical thing, i 
accidentally, ive written name 
command wrong 
didnt understand 
function stroke width exist 
i made an error, told that 
wouldnt work 
common easy mistake to make um, 
completely accidental in 
inaudible, in case im going to 
leave this in video helps 
you see exactly kind areas you 
get, happens you get that, 
you get this little red bar coming 
you know something is wrong 
gives you information 
used function strokewidth 
exists 
inaudible whats one them, stroke 
width inaudible points 
ill go commands in main 
page 
there we are, weve got a dot 
screen 
there two things that i want to 
show you that useful 
firstly we sometimes want to write notes 
in programs, if we want to sort 
explain 
so maybe i want to explain so even 
explain to somebody else using 
program simply if youre going back to 
program later useful to 
notes to remind whats going 
we call comments we create a 
comment putting slashes in 
front line anything else 
that line is ignored 
i could end a line a 
well 
sound sometimes if i want to get 
rid a line code temporarily im 
testing im i comment 
like this, so i put a comment, 
turn a comment 
comments going to get ignored 
well see now, stroke weight 
is longer called dot is 
tiny you may even able to see 

thing id like to do, show you, 
is another useful thing you 
can, youre, youre programming, is 
that you also print stuff 
if you print ln, that stands print 
line, text 
like that, will print 
note that im putting text values 
in double quotes 
you need double quotes so that 
program knows this isnt name a 
function anything, this is actual text 
you want to use 
so you need to that in double 
quotes 
im program, will print 
heavily here bottom 
screen 
thats useful you, well see in 
future, a way getting information 
program running, 
debugging 
okay, so lets recap that a little bit 
core writing a program is 
number commans 
command a name 
parameters, values that 
we pass to command to change 
works 
example, size command takes a 
width a height 
parameters inside brackets 
we need commas to separate 
we need a semicolon end 
line 
this punctuation is important, 
you mustnt forget 
we use comments to get computer 
to ignore certain bits 
okay, so last thing is, i showed you, 
is this println command, 
using to print things 
print text, you also print 
different values like numbers 
variables well come to in 
future 
you use plus to combine 
together text values, so thatll 
quite useful in a number ways later 
that way, we keep blocking programs 
okay 
so thats a brief introduction to 
basics programming ill a 
couple extra lectures this week 
specific topics will covering 
various topics next, next couple weeks 
to explain concepts we use in 
main languages
