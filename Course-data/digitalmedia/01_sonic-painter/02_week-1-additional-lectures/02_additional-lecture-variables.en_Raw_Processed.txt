welcome to second lecture 
introductory programming you 
course we need programming 
so in this session id like to talk 
variables, we start lets 
an example 
so lets write a simple processing 
program, 
correct size screen, set 
background, i might if you havent 
looked main videos yet, youll 
find number is right in 
there 
lets draw points, lets set stroke 
rate say see point draw, 
draw a point, position , say 
thats a fairly basic processing program 
we gave, a point 
ever you want to draw a point in 
middle screen 
well, we something like this 
middle screen is half 
width half height, we 
width divided , height divided 
there we go to point in 
middle screen 
now, exactly i done there 
so quite used to, last 
session we saw, we saw we could call 
a command like point, using numbers 
weve used thats something 
different weve called point width 
divided height divided 
so is width 
a, it, behind scenes, a 
number, a number that gives us width 
screen 
in case example, 
here a name that stands that 
number, i use that name in 
program instead using a number i 
calculations ive divided 

that slash sign well com to later is 
is division in program, we 
dont an easy like divide symbol in 
the, in in keyboard 
so thats a new element 
something thats called a 
variable 
a variable is essentially a name that 
stand a number 
called a variable 
stand a number, change 
number stands 
change 
so that mean 
if we want to create 
variable 
well see in future examples, 
useful to a, a name to 
refer to a particular number 
so, this is we create a variable, 
ill go this in detail 
if creating a known variable, 
will look something like this 
correcting a variable that is a 
number that starts equal to 
we first, we need to go back to 
example a computer is, you 
think really is happening 
so this is computer, got a 
processor a memory, variables, astute 
memory 
happens 
a variable is, is a little box in 
memory 
and, inside that little box memory you 
put memory different things 
first part this command to, 
create a variable, int well come back to 
exactly that means 
basically saying this is a number 
so create new box big enough to hold 
number 
next thing we is give a name 
call is pos x, example 
thats name value 
call anything, alright 
call john, call mark 
in this example, im representing x 
position something 
so im going to call posx 
we set equal to a, to 
that means putting in number 
inside little box, in memory 
inaudible 
so we in a case variable is, a 
variable is basically a box in memory 
a name 
values in 
values numbers 
things 
so lets go back to we talking 
in 
previous lecture memory is 
composed a whole lot 
think s, we said 
is that we create lots different 
things s, interpret 
in different ways 
so we could basically true, false, 
simple one bit 
there is inaudible one bit in reality 
think bit 
you numbers we saw we 
whole numbers, factional numbers, we 
text, we really complex 
things like images audio wave forms 
we variables 
to represent things 
key thing is that take 
different amounts memory 
so a number, a whole number is actually 
inaudible different need a 
fractional number 
things need a lot less 
memory text certainly an, 
an image 
so creating that little box in 
memory a variable, we need to know 
roughly big is kind 
thing going to put in 
that reason, we give names to 
different types data 
that this we call different 
types, types theres a tight boolean, 
true false, thats 

a tight int, that means integer, is 
a mathematical word whole number 
float, a floating point number 
means a fractional number, sort 
decimal number 
reason called flight is slightly 
complicated, due to 
representation number in 
computer 
string is a word a text, so this 
little string characters 
there complex types 
pimage audiobuffer that specific 
to processing unknown not, yet 
come back to in a minute 
weve also got a special type void 
we will come back to in a fu, 
future lecture, represents nothing 
come back to we might want trips in 
life 
so thats, comes back to little int 
in there 
that int that posx represents 
fact that posx is a number 
a whole number 
so we we know exactly 
computer knows, exactly kind 
thing you want to put in 
thats we put zero in there, we 
put a word like thread 
we in turn say float instead int 
that will give us a factual number 
string if you want to put text in there 
so, lets look something else we might 
variable, setting value 
so this is saying that variable 
setting in x position 
becomes equal to a number 
now, lets go back 
becomes equal to, thats an important 
thing 
equal, equal, that equal signs, in 
programming is whats called an 
assignment operator 
takes one value left side it, 
sets to new value 
so changes value posx 
saying that theyre equal to 
begin with, youve done posx 
equals , that posx is 
that equal sign is you change 
values 
you set a variable to equal to 
another variable 
so pos x is going to equal to 
width screen 
a function, certain functions 
calculations 
give you back numbers, 
values 
to now, functions weve seen 
stuff like drawing 
sometimes we a function like 
random, a useful function, 
generates a random number 
so this call is going to give us a random 
number between zero 
hes going to set posx to equal to 
that random number 
so that posx is a random value 
well see in main lecture we 
use a number functions to 
calculations give us back a 
value that we put in variable 
so giving numbers to, this random 
function, giving zero a 
that controls works 
basically, say, , 
random, will give us a number between 

if i say , itll give us a number 
between , gives us 
back a number if you present posx to 
there 
functions return return strings, 
texts, boolean variable values, images, 
return kind type, 
something that we, put in a 
variable 
we also calculations put 
results in a variable 
so we take a value, in this 
case 
is another there 
mousex 
mousex is a variable represents 
position mouse 
x position mouse 
we add something to 
we add 
that gives us a new number 
whatever mouse x is plus set mouse 
x 

if you basic math 
we take that value put in 
posx 
we something else 
we take value change based 
old value 
so we take posx, make equal to 
old value posx plus 
so if posx is , we add to set 
posx to that 
thats a way changing a variable we 
use 
in in future lessons well see we 
use that to animate things 
every time changing value 
variable, if that position, variable is a 
position something similar, we 
make things move around 
this is a common thing to do, 
theres this little shorthand 
posx plus equals one means posx equals 
posx plus 
means exactly thing 
a way adding a value to 
posx plus, plus is an even shorter 
shorthand the, you know value 
adding is 
posx plus, plus means add one 
posx 
posx plus equals means add a number to 

three expressions showing 
you, three lines code, 
exact thing 
in first two, i could change 
value add instead 
last one is always adding 
so, lets look the, things you 
calculations 
you basic maths 
weve seen to add you use plus 
sign 
straightforwardly, to add two things 
youd plus equals 
if you want to add something to a 
variable plus, plus if you want to 
add one to a variable, could exactly 
subtract, minus signs, take 
two numbers subtract them, minus 
equals subtract number a variable, 
minus, minus, subtract one 
star is asterisk, is used 
multiplication, theres sort 
multiply sign standard 
keyboard 
we star equals to multiply 
value err something that 
equivalent to plus, plus 
slash is divide symbol, stars 
multiply 
so basic math, therere 
operations 
thats 
another thing you need to think in 
terms calculations is brackets 
if you want to multiple calculations 
one line combine together, 
you put brackets round you 
would in standard maths to constrain 
happens first 
so, this stuff in inner brackets is 
done first 
you calculate first brackets, 
use results that calculation 
in outer brackets 
so youll, whats happening here is 
youre multiplying x youre 
adding to result 
okay, so lets get back to various types 
weve talked a lot variables 
we different types 
boolean, int, float, string 
mostly talked numbers 
thats mostly going to 
using in graphics 
in future we will talk boolean 
i want to talk basically 
things like pimage audioplayer, 
theyre actually much 
complex something like a number 
obviously a, a whole audio file is 
complex a number, even way 
variable works is slightly different 
so this week matthews going to talk 
audioplayer lets a look 

so we int pause x, we get 
type variable name 
here we give title variable audio 
player, name, is player 
you give name you like 
if a high hat we call high 
hat, if a violin sound we call 
violin 
we call anything we like 
so thats essentially thing 
minim is another aud type we use in 
audio 
matthew will talk exactly 
thats used for, here is we 
create minim objects 
so, we set value 
int variable to 
you set value an object, 
so i didnt use term, 
complex types called objects 
objects called minim 
now, we need an extra bit in here, 
theres easy way saying 
right 
we write three, if you want a 
new variable, a new number 
theres quite so easy way 
that 
we need a new command called new, 
new is create a new object 
calling a function 
called a constructor 
this is like a command 
name type, object 
used to create value 
objects 
theyre new in constructor 
name type combine together 
to create a new value objects 
you inaudible pass parameters 
in like command 
matthew will explain this, this 
essentially means, the, something 
that wraps programming, you dont 
to worry much 
an example passing something 
in, so that used in creating an 
object 
so, in an audio file, you might pass in 
file name 
in an image, you might pass in how, 
width height image 
theres lots things you could pass 
theres another important thing, 
big difference between types like numbers 
objects 
a number is a number you 
calculations 
in a, in an object, well 
value, you call a function that 
object 
that means is, if youre calling a 
function play, thats a generic 
function, that doesnt apply everywhere, 
you know, you cant play 
youre playing a particular audio file 
kay, meaning to play an audio file 
thats we this little bit 
style code 
playerplay 
recalling play a specific object 
inaudible specific audio file, 
general audio file one particular 
item 
using this little dot 
a dot is links function 
youre calling to things 
called 
so you do, playerplay cause function 
one specific object 
a useful capability 
so this is something that mathews 
going to use that nick i 
going to use in examples a bit later 
in this lesson 
so that a brief introduction to 
variables 
youll see a lot examples in main 
lessons 
hopefully that will help you 
understand concepts that we build 
programming 
if you need help weve provided 
a bunch links relating to programming
