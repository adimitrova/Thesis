this weeks additional programming 
lecture is arrays 
so last week we talked variables 
i talked a variable is a 
place in memory a box in memory 
you put data 
thats obviously useful 
storing types data, 
able to access via name 
really suitable one 
particular item data, a single number, 
a single image 
part benefit using a 
computer, is that you compute lots 
lots data 
well see in this weeks lecture, 
we use lots lots images to 
create an animation 
to that you need, a way storing 
images in a convenient way, 
a hundred variables, if 
you a hundred images in one 
dimension 
and, that is you we use 
something called an array 
an array variable is created 
much like variable, except you 
two little square brackets 
makes look a little like a box, 
ill come to exactly mean in a 
minute 
we put between type 
variable, int, variable name plus 
x 
we put square brackets in that, 
tells us that an array variable, 
is to, stor, study, storing one 
int, store many integers 
if we see here bottom in 
memory, rather a single box, a 
lot boxes, value 
memory number 
you access a single name, 
posx this, boxes 
together 
a single variable, we lots 
different bits data 
so you access an individual item 
data 
you access a number, you use 
square brackets, this is 
square brackets come in 
there way you get access to a 
particular item array, inside 
square brackets, you put a number 
so boxes a number, 
this is way you get box number three, 
you would get an item that 
one thing to note, importantly, is 
that starts , so first element 
in an array is element 
you would naturally think element 
is not, 
that will influence you 
everything right 
important to clear that 
that means if youve got a number 
element elements in an array 
elements in, first element is 
, last one is , is 
, starts 
a little bit confusing 
unfortunate, thats way 
works, you will get used to 
quickly 
so this is you set an element to 
array, like you would set a variable 
to be, using equals command 
you set element here, using 
equals, we to use square 
brackets to get hold that value 
like ordin, ordinary 
variable 
this is you create an array, one way 
creating an array 
in example well actually use a 
function to create an array, we 
declare a new variable 
there many type create box in memory, 
to this you say type a, 
called a floating point 
we square brackets, 
square brackets tell us one 
floating value, an array 
give a name, like variable 
you create an array 
this is, curly brackets a 
list numbers 
that gives you an array 
well see in actual example, 
well a different, use a different 
mechanism, next week well use yet 
another mechanism 
but, here is an example creating a 
simple array, you use 
element zero 
you use this syntax 
square brackets, name array, 
square brackets number, to get 
element 
youve got that element, you 
use in way youd use 
variable, way youd use a number 
so print out, you 
use inputs to command you 
like 
so you could translate vals zero, 
rotate, wrecked, commands 
that youre familiar 
so we use rectval zero, we could use 
fill vals zero, commands 
youre used to 
wherever you would use a normal variable, 
you could use an array variable, plus 
squared brackets a number 
that would give you a number 
value, like value 
simple, well in main 
example you use images, 
to create an animation
