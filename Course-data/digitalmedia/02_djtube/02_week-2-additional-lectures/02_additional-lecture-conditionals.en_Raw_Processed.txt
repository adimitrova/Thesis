this lecture ill talk 
conditionals 
statements, mechanisms 
we use in programs to make decisions 
so, to now, programs 
responding to use an input in various 
ways, always kind 
thing 
sometimes we want to different things, 
depending whether user 
different stuff, different conditions 
happen in program 
so, we want to a different thing 
mouse button is 

weve seen ways that 
mouse button 
we used dragging mouse, mouse 
dragging method 
well look a general way 
making that kind decision in 
programming 
so lets look an example 
so this is a simple program that 
roughly weve done 
draws points mouse position 
this is different 
programs weve looked last week except 

this draw method 
rather in mouse drags, so 
mouse moved, 
in draw, that means happening 
every front 
thats a useful thing 
well talk this week in terms 
animations, rather 
simply responding to input user, 

proactively animating stuff 
we need to do, drawing actions 
animation actions constantly 
theres user input 
thats inaudible so whats 
happening is every frame drawing a 
point and, moment this doesnt 
get us much uh, unknown 
well see there things we 
draw in todays lecture 
in particular id like to look 
copying kind functionality we 
mouse dragged using this draw 
method 
main difference here is that 
we use mouse dragged would work 
mouse is down, working 
the, mouse is 

if we this way, would we go 
about, drawing point, 
mouse is pressed 
so, we need to draw point, if 
mouse is pressed 
we need to make that decision, if 
mouse is pressed, draw a point 
if not, dont draw 
way we that is use a method 
called an if statement 
so we say, if mouse is pressed 
draw a point inaudible this 
if i drag mouse pointer around 
window, without mouse pressed 
nothing, minute i press mouse we 
start drawing 
so thats really nice 
now, im going to go back slides to 
explain that 
so this is roughly we saw, im using 
an elipse rather mouse points 
pretty much is code if 
something inside if, is 
mousepressed, a variable 
this is a variable takes two 
values, either true, false 
ill come back to that in detail 
then, depending whether true 
false different things 
so that if is if, thing 
inside brackets, variable inside 
brackets, in this case mousepressed 
is true, we that line that comes 

good 
we draw the, we draw ellipse to 
point 
we carry rest 
program 
if this thing inside brackets is 
false, is true mousepressed is 
true, so mouse isnt pressed 
period we dont line 
statement we carry straight 
ahead 
so this if allows us to make a decision 
based whether something is true 
false 
wherever in this case, mouse is 
pressed not, we different things 
if mouse is pressed, we draw 
ellipse 
if isnt pressed, dont 
we complicated things 
so first thing is, well if i 
want to something special 
mouse isnt pressed 
this is another example 
if mouse is pressed, if mousepressed 
is true, we draw a white background 
we whatever else we want 
in this case, weve also got 
something different 
weve got, long if, weve got 
this thing, else 
this means happens if 
bit isnt true 
so mousepressed is false 
we this line, background zero, 
we bit thats attached to else 
so we an else, if happens 
true else happens 
false 
we draw background we carry 
rest unknown 
note that ive indented two bits 
code that controlled if 
else 
thats necessary, a, a 
crucial part program 
program wont complain if you dont 
that 
makes a lot clearer to 
understand code if every time you 
an if, you indent a bit 
thats telling you 
o so you better move in a bit 
that tells you that this bit is 
controlled if statement 
so this bit, is part code thats 
controlled if statement 
another thing you do, is you 
multiple commands a single if 
statement 
combining in special curly 
brackets 
you saw curly brackets before, 
start end setup draw, 
mousepressed this is another instance 
theyre really, curly brackets 
always used to glue bits code 
together 
so that used if 
a single line code instead context 
in this context, theyre grouping 
together, so theyre controlled 
mousepressed, in this context, 
your, lines code will 
happen if mousepressed is true 
noise so lets look 
is mousepressed 
well, ive shown you slide a number 
times 
theres lots different types data 
that could be, you know represents 
computer 
mousepressed is a variable that 
take two values, true false 
we call a boolean variable 
named magician george 
bool, developed a system 
mathematical logic based values true 
false 
we create a boolean variable 
like variable 
we give a title, we need to give 
title to variable 
that is boolean 
we set a value, we to set 
either to false to true 
so if we want to, a variable 
says whether the, background is 
black, we set that to true false 
we change value that variable 
like variable this is 
like a clever trick to that 
exclamation mark means 
that means is means opposite 
so black is opposite black 
so if black is true, black is false 
black is false, black is true 
so inverts 
setting black equals black, we 
switch to opposite 
so like, like a little switch, 
light switch 
if we, if black is true we hit 
black, black equals black 
becomes false 
if is false, becomes true 
this is useful we 
example we click, we put a 
line code like this in mouse clicks 
and, we we turn that varlible, 
variable off, whenever its, mouse 
is clicked we switch value one 
variables 
maybe we see that an example 
so, lets first give an exam, a different 
example using example i gave 
else, unknown background 
sound going to swap things round 
so using an if bit an 
else bit 
so that something different will happen 
in either case if mouse is pressed 
mouse is, to code in 
background 
im holding mouse button 

background is white 
minute i turns black 
okay, lets try creating reading 
variable 
version mousepressed 
we make that bo, created 
boolean variable 
give, give type boolean 
set it, call black 
set initially to false 
noise we use variable black 
in this if statement and, and, you 
run program, going to 
anything in interesting black is 
always false, you cant change 
so lets change we click 
mouse 
noise so you put in 
mousepressed, we did, black equals 
black, exactly i showed you 
every time i click mouse 
value black boolean variable 
switches, color this, 
window changes 
now, we useful things 
we dont to use boolean 
variables 
whats happening here 
well, this is whats called a boolean 
expression 
so we, we use expressions well 
variables, a boolean expression is a 
bit maths that is a literal false 
this boolean expression is checking 
value a key 
pressed keyboard 
saying, if this key expression 
is equal to character bits so ill 
press b key 
you notice im using two equal signs 
thats a single equal sign we 
saw last week, means becomes equal to 
so, setting value 
variable 
two equals signs, setting 
value variable key doesnt become 
b, checking if is b 
were, checking value a 
variable 
so, we to remember difference 
between two equals signs, 
thats an common thing to trip 
easy to forget theres single 
equals theres double equals 
if youre using inside an if statement, 
you always using a double 
equals 
to let you know, just, single 
quotation marks means im working a 
single character 
double quotes means im working 
words strings characters 
sound so weve got a bunch specials, 
weve seen a double equals thats 
first boolean expression 
so if we two values, a variable a 
value, we check if equal to 
thats true if theyre 
same, false if otherwise 
we also test things like we 
test whether one value is less 
another value 
so this little arrow here is true if 
thing left is less 
thing right 
youve got a variant that called less 
equals 
straight less is false if 
two 
less equals is true if theyre 
same, if theyre, if thing 
left is less thing 
right 
goes greater than, thing 
left is thing 
right, equal to 
weve already seen not, that means 
opposite a boolean value, we also 
equal to, so we check if 
something is worth checking 
same, we check if different 
noise so we think of, look 
complicated examples 
example, if we want position 
mouse to change background 
color 
this is a boolean expression 
checks if mouse position is less 
half width screen, so 
mouse position is less middle 
screen mouse x, so mouse is 
left screen 
so if we look here we mouse position 
there, red circle is 
well, mouse x is going to less 
half width 
thats going to true 
youre going to draw background in 
black 
if mouse pointer is there on, 
circle is 
mouse actually is going to 
width screen 
so going to hit else part 
is going to 
we even combine things 
so we an if statement inside an 
if statement 
so we check if mousex is less 
width divided inside 
that, we check even down, 
divide this screen check this 
width divided 
so we create a little line 
middle screen 
so, if we look red point there, 
thats less half width 
thats true 
a quarter width 
so thats true 
so we draw background in black 
put a point there 
still less half, half 
width a quarter 
width 
so less a quarter width 
so that second if statement is false 
we engage to this else bit 
is else bit that e if 
statement 
secondary statement 
unknown in white 
points way there 
first if statement is false 
we never get to second if statement 
second if statement is inside 
first one 
we get to else part if 
statement draws screen white 
sound we also combine together 
boolean expressions in ways 
so if you two boolean expressions a, 
a b, we combine together 
this double ampersand here 
says if a, a b true, so 
things true, something 
we could way around 
two lines, say if a is 
true b is true, true, so 
one to true 
inaudible 
together 
lets a look this example 
this is a, an easier way writing 
ive done 
this line 
so that doubleedge statement i 
showed you a couple slides back did, 
check basically if mousex is 
left middle screen 
right is a line thats a quarter 
way across screen 
instead if statements, we 
use an 
checks, this expression 
if this point true 
checks that expression, is also 
true 
total expression here 
to true cause im using 
that double and, we call and, 
theyre true we true 
part if statements 
if we move here, first part is still 
true, second part is false 
theyre true so well move 
to else part 
assuming there theyre false, 
neither true, use else 
if we change to we a 
different effect, so looking this 
time if mousex is width 
two less width divided 
four, so kind 
opposite 
looking at, you know, side 
that little bar middle 
screen 
so if we look this one here, 
width divided two, 
is less width divided four 
so thats true 
so one is true, so one 
needs to true to, whole 
statement to true, if using 

so we true part if 
statement 
if we look there, well, mouse x greater 
width is still false, still 
true 
this time, longer less 
width divided , so that parts 
also false 
theyre false, so we get else 
if you look here, well, mousex is 
width, thats true 
part is true, still 
false 
so weve, one is still true, 
so we go to if path, we use 

so, thats end lecture 
conditionals, if statements well 
using examples if statements in 
main lectures 
thank you much
