1
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:17,136
[SOUND]. 
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:20,328
Okay so we've created a slider which 
allows us to vary the speed of the 

3
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,968
playback, and you saw that there's 
immediately some quite pleasing creative 

4
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:29,157
effects you can achieve with that. 
What we want to do now is add another 

5
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:32,756
control which is to play and stop the 
sound, so we can completely switch it 

6
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:35,780
off... 
And switch it back on again. 

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,520
It's a little bit more complicated, 
you're going to do it with a button. 

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,100
So we'll basically make the top part of 
the screen into a button which can switch 

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,670
the play back on and off. 
And then we'll make the bottom part of 

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,110
the screen into the slider that we used 
earlier. 

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,360
Here's the sketch with the slider. 
So first of all I'm going to go to 

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,840
trigger this code. 
If the mouse Y position is greater than 

13
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,950
the height of 2. 
Okay so if we're in the bottom half of 

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,050
the screen, we'e in the bottom half of 
the screen it'll operate the speed 

15
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,480
slider. 
Now what I'm also going to do to make it 

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,910
obvious That that's, that's what we're 
doing there. 

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,030
I'm going to draw a rectangle in the 
bottom half of the screen, which has the 

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,680
color of the current speed. 
Let's leave grayscale for now, because 

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,380
I'm not working too much on the graphics 
in this session. 

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,750
So we'll just do a grayscale color. 
So you remember, color is in the range 0 

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,940
to 255 We've got this ratio, which isn't 
0 to 2. 

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,709
So, we can just do something like, ratio 
times, 128. 

23
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:54,350
Now approximately, give us, a gray scale 
based on, on the, the range of the 

24
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,360
slider. 
So the rectangle needs to be at position 

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
It takes up half of the, the bottom half 
of the screen. 

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,520
So we go zero zero and height over two, 
so it starts at the far left of the 

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,760
screen, halfway down, and it goes to the 
far right of the screen. 

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,410
Therefore the size of it is the width of 
the screen and the height is the height 

29
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,060
of the screen over two. 
So remember that's the x and y position. 

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,122
That's the width of the square, and 
that's the height. 

31
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:25,975
So let's just double check that, that's 
working before we carry on. 

32
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay, so I've got, cannot find symbol. 
Let's see if we can debug that. 

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,820
So I'm referring to a variable called 
ratio. 

34
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,420
Where did ratio get defined? 
Well, it's inside the if statement. 

35
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,980
So that means that ratio, because I've 
declared it there with float ratio, that 

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,040
that variable is local to the if 
function. 

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,660
So it's not okay for me to then use it 
outside the if function. 

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,070
So what I can do is take it out like that 
and, so now I'm declaring it above the if 

39
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,765
statement, and I am then using it outside 
the if statement that's fine. 

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:08,505
Okay, so now I have a problem here, where 
I've forgotten to put a t there. 

41
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:13,080
Okay, See that, see that it's 
highlighting the line that has the 

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,630
problem. 
It's quite communicative about the, the 

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:24,024
errors in your code. 
[MUSIC] SSS Okay. 

44
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:33,430
So now you can see the slide is now 
displaying a color, which represents the 

45
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,280
speed. 
So I now need to quickly add a bottom and 

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,960
top of the screen, which deals with, 
which deals with the stopping and 

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,902
starting. 
First of all, I am going to draw the 

48
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:48,560
button. 
So I will do, and I'll choose whether to 

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
draw it red or green, based on the state 
of a boolean. 

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,105
So we create a boolean called buttonOn, 
and we start off with buttonOn equals 

51
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:06,954
false. 
So the button starts off being off. 

52
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:13,090
Now if button on, so we'll represent my 
button as having a state of being on or 

53
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,500
off. 
It's just a switch so I use a Boolean 

54
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,520
which can be a true or a false. 
and Boolean's are used quite extensively 

55
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,170
in controlling the state of programs. 
Way things can either be on or off. 

56
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,513
So it the button is on, I'll set the fill 
color to. 

57
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:37,435
Red. 
Otherwise, I'll set it to. 

58
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:40,085
Green. 
Can you guess? 

59
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:45,470
Okay. 
So, then I draw my rectangle. 

60
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,148
this one starts at 0. 
This one starts at 0,0 and goes to, and 

61
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:58,534
the size is the same size as the other 
one so it's width, height over 2. 

62
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:04,501
Okay, then I need to manage it. 
If they press mouse, if the mouse is 

63
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:09,360
pressed, I need to now update this data 
that button. 

64
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,950
So I need to check where it is if Mouse Y 
is less than the height over 2. 

65
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,840
In other words if they're in the top half 
of the screen, which is where about I'm 

66
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,420
going to be, then I set, I toggle value 
to bottom button on equals. 

67
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,020
And this is how to toggle a Boolean 
[SOUND], I'll use this operator here, the 

68
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,730
exclamation mark. 
That'll switch button on to whatever the 

69
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,250
opposite state is. 
So if it's true it'll switch it to false. 

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,886
If it's false it'll switch it to true. 
And then, I'm going to change the state 

71
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:44,670
of the player. 
So if the button is on I want the player 

72
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,870
to play. 
Remove that line. 

73
00:05:48,870 --> 00:06:00,332
Otherwise, I want the player to stop. 
Okay, let's just clean that up a bit. 

74
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:04,548
Remember, you can always do the Also 
format. 

75
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:07,318
Ctrl+T, Apple+T, depending on what you're 
using. 

76
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:11,460
Okay? 
So, basically, if they are in the region 

77
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,000
of the button, which is the top half of 
the screen, then we switch the state of 

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,250
the button, and then we look at what the 
current state of the button is now, and 

79
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,235
update the player to either stop or, or 
play, based on that. 

80
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:29,010
And then we draw the button with either 
red or green depending on the states in 

81
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,670
the draw function. 
So let's roll that. 

82
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,620
Okay, I can't spell button. 
It's bu. 

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,475
So again it highlighted the line a little 
examination of that line showed that I 

84
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:49,893
mistyped the name of the variable. 
[MUSIC] There's my button, switching it 

85
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:55,300
on and off. 
[MUSIC] So even a DJ could operate this 

86
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,740
interface. 
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] I'm not a DJ, as you can 

87
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,450
tell. 
There you go. 

88
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:21,145
So there's a simple interface which 
allows you to control the speed and the 

89
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:28,609
playback state of an audio player. 
[MUSIC] [MUSIC]
