music 
okay, so weve heard marco explain in 
detail you access lots 
different images arrange 
put screen 
weve heard matt tell you a lot 
detail sound is organized, 
to get sounds, 
to things 
weve got an example that weve prepared 
you, you to munge around 
play called dj tube 
like a really basic example 
djvj app that you expand 
develop 
to start with, you really 
make interesting audio visual apps, 
you to good graphics 
you make yourself, 
im sure many you will 
a lot you might want to get 
started without to that 
hassle 
able to drop something in 
youll find in example, 
dj tube example, 
theres a sample movie 
marco will show you frames 
a tube train, i want to 
show you i got that 
you prepare use in this app 
so normally if im bored, im looking 
images i dont want to to pay 
huge amounts royalties, 
i go to internet archive 
if youve never to 
internet archive, 
you ever internet 
i dont know if that is 
probably best 
one best sites internet 
one longest standing 
you cool things 
internet archive 
you look websites 
see way in 
i dont know if that interests you 
i guess limited interest, 
you also 
get access to a huge array 
copyrightfree video 
thats great, so 
going to start there 
first thing i want to 
is im going to type vj loops, 
is easy gets 
youll see there ive got vj loops, 
quickly followed vj loops george bush, 
although there arent george bush vj 
loops so youll to upload 
thats thing internet 
archive, if you make cool video, 
you always upload there 
a nice place 
to stored 
a nice way giving back 
you able to 
use this stuff 
youll see that there loads loads 
loads vj loops you to use 
so example, 
heres a bunch video stuff, 
this is mainly, i think people dancing 
in a club, put a red filter 
you could probably that yourself, 
if youre home 
dont happen to in a club, 
you go to archive 
theres shed loads stuff 
there that you try use 
youve got a video, 
you manipulate it, 
you treat using imovie, 
adobe premier, 
kind editing 
software that you like 
a lot people use final cut pro 
going to show you 
that stuff today 
to you 
you really need to able to 
you make work inside 
a mobile app is you need to able 
to cut individual frames 
why, is that 
well, ill tell you 
thats mobile devices, 
play back video, thats fine, 
theyve got problem playing back video 
problem is in allowing you 
to manipulate that video effectively, 
ie, change speed playback 
skip one frame to another 
sorts things that 
youre making kind multimedia app, 
you want to able to video 
enough to able 
to play a video file back 
thats really simple 
we want to show you to is 
to make something you 
edit in real time, in time to music, 
thats dj tube app 
so we need to split 
individual frames 
weve written a piece software 
you to allow you to that 
so you download a video 
youve downloaded video, 
you run a piece software 
that weve prepared you 
im going to locate 
will in lesson document, 
so go to lesson documents 
im going there 
bear while i look slightly mad 
here we 
in coursera lessons lesson 
week called imagesaver 
now, imagesaver you might find 
actually got a bunch frames in 
so im going to remove frames, 
im going to launch it, 
a processing sketch 
asks you a quicktime movie 
creates a series 
individual frames, so, 
ive got here a movie is, 
i think we recorded 
straight internet 
let see if i find 
oh yeah, here we go 
so here is, 
this ones internet archive 
runs video 
makes a series 
individual frames, like so 
thats done, click stop 
go to data directory 
actually, you go to directory 
imagesaver application is, 
one i showed you about, 
youll see weve got movie, movie, 
movie, movie, movie, movie 
now, film is made individual 
frames you probably know 
frame contains 
scene often, 
elements scene moved 
so stringing frames together, 
we control that motion 
now, im going to copy this 
stuff directory here 
ive got djtube, here is, 
data folder animationdata, 
im going to paste in 
there is, neatly pasted in 
i run this, 
lets close imagesaver, youll see, 
ive got exactly code that 
marco telling us 
animationdata, movie is name 
actual movie, weve got a number 
we know theres a images i 
know thats biggest number 
images 
lets check thats true 
yeah, , so thats last image 
in sequence, we load in 
now, if we run that, you see here 
im going to show you 
that works ipad 
i think i prepared 
here we go 
lets audio 
i start, plays back 
music 
i also change 
music 
youll notice that i 
change speed app, 
image that slows down, 
audio that slows 
so itll synchronizes 
image frames audio frames 
i also get two loops 
music 
thats right 
music 
scratch 
music 
so lets a look that works 
so, actually, 
we go to see that works, 
youll notice theres 
also this black record 
this record is spinning round changing 
speed based fast playing back 
ive cheated 
i could in two ways 
i could getting one image 
rotating it, 
i could use technique 
that marco introduced to you, 
weve gone 
video 
we make a series frames 
a record deck rotating, 
we animate in a sequence 
so thats weve done in this case 
if i show you in data folder, 
youll see weve 
got blackrecordpng, 
youll notice a png 
main reason a png is that 
we a transparency 
means that we dont see a square 
image a round thing inside 
a png file, a png file, 
that means 
a transparent background 
actually, png files 
transparent insides well, so 
you holes in 
we an example that here, 
ill show you 
we a tv 
if i show you tv image, 
actually transparent inside 
so we tv in application, 
we place video behind it, 
tv sits top 
black record, 
weve got a different position 
if i cycle images, 
we got a different position 
different rotations 
we rotate around, thats we 
create illusion moving 
we update this image based 
speed playback 
so lets quickly 
a look we that 
you see here, we load images in, 
weve loaded 
images movie 
weve loaded in blackrecord 
a sequence images 
weve loaded in tv 
theyre images that we 
weve loaded in sounds in 
way that we last weeks session 
exactly 
marcos described to 
position elements screen 
youll see that 
we change frame, 
current frame, 
based speed, okay 
so every time we go 
draw loop we add to 
currentframe number 
multiply current speed 
that is 
tries to go one part 
image sequence to next 
part image sequence 
multiplied given 
speed, slow speed 
ill look that 
in a bit detail, 
this value currentframe tells us 
current frame 
we use that to access 
current record 
okay, so moving on, we know 
weve actually selected a specific record 
we want to happen is we want to 
touch middle record 
anywhere around record we want 
to start playing we that 
we touch again, 
we want to stop 
so heres a bit code that that 
basically, dist method 
we get distance 
current mouse position 
to center record 
if thats less 
width record player, 
we basically say a hit 
we play back sound 
theres two methods, 
one record deck, 
that means that we independently know 
whether user touched one record 

play back appropriate sound 

getting distance 
checking whether less width 
so basically saying is if 
mousex mousey position within 
range entire graphic, 
that means users pressed record 
we one methods 
records ive said 
ive also got another mouse interaction 
is a drag interaction, 
this changes speed adjustment 
so we synchronize two loops 
music 
now, theyre actually speed 
are, two loops trimmed in 
way that matt showing you 
so that number 
pauses, number actual pauses, 
that doesnt mean theyre 
length in time 
could entirely different speeds 
so, theres an easy way 
synchronizing two loops together 
one loop acts master, 
acts slave 
if we know length loop, 
we synchronize master 
loop to slave loop 
so, speed second record 
player is basically a ratio 
so if a one, would be, 
speed ration one, 
means current speed 
if naught , would a speed 
ratio one half, so half speed 
if two, 
a speed ratio twice speed 
if we get length 
second player in milliseconds 
we divide length 
first player in milliseconds 
so we take first loop, 
we get length in milliseconds, 
we divide length 
sorry, we get second loop, we get 
length second loop in milliseconds, 
we divide 
length first loop 
that gives us a ratio, 
tells us fast second 
record player go 
thats this is here 
playerspeed is playergetlengthms 
divided playergetlengthms 
that gives us actual speed ratio 
so players speed is found 
dividing length 
length master loop 
in this case, 
player is master loop 
ive already described, 
we change speed using 
speedadjust variable 
basically, mouse touch 
interaction changes multiplier, 
you see theres a bit 
code here that handles that 
playerspeed is always going to 
equal to speed adjustment 
so if ive got mouse here, 
thats master loop 
thats speed 
music 
players speed is ive described, 
length player 
divided length player 
multiplied speed adjustment 
current frame, is 
frame video, is current frame plus 
one times speed adjustment thats 
gives us this nice interaction 
music 
so theyre really fast 
theyre really slow 
video stays in synch 
music 
i think i like 
like this best 
music 
time really slow 
music
