[SOUND]. 
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:23,022
Well, that's the end of week two. 
and I hope that was interesting, and 

3
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,734
useful. 
A bit more complicated than last week, 

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,576
don't you think? 
 >> Yeah, for sure. 

5
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:32,076
so we're really trying to combine these 
different elements, and, and work with a 

6
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:36,500
lot of different data here. 
So you, so you figured out how to work 

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,845
with sequences, and images, and how to 
play two sounds at the same time. 

8
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,530
 >> Mm. 
 >> So you're really making, these, 

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,170
these applications more complex. 
And also I hope a lot more fun to, to 

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,225
interact with. 
So what can you do? 

11
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,892
I'll put these apps in, in your friend's 
hands and get them to play with them. 

12
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:53,510
 >> Whacka, whacka. 
Yeah, yeah, and maybe make some YouTube 

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,770
videos and stuff. 
That's always fun. 

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,410
make a video with some terrible techno o 
VJ behavior. 

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,330
What about, yeah maybe try to play more 
than one sound at once, as well. 

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,528
[CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Work with images. 

17
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:06,030
 >> Yeah. 
 >> Work with images because, ye, well 

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,700
now you've got images in there, you've 
got a much richer visual feel, much more 

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,220
varied than you can. 
 >> Mm. 

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,180
 >> I mean, the Drawing command's 
impressing and really powerful, but once 

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,320
you've got images, there's the, it's the 
richness of the real world that you can 

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,981
bring into it. 
 >> And you can get loads of images, 

23
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:19,450
can't you? 
 >> Yeah. 

24
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,800
 >> Off stuff like the internet archive, 
and things like that. 

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,370
And again you should use the forums if 
you want, if you got any questions. 

26
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,680
We have our students on there. 
Students who are on degree programs in 

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,104
creative computing, students who, you 
know, doing various kind of ghost less 

28
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:37,010
type stuff, you know, very creative, very 
energetic, good engineers as well, good 

29
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,020
programmers. 
 >> Technically they know their stuff. 

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,050
 >> Yeah. 
 >> Also they've got lots of experience 

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,785
in audio visual work so they, they know, 
a lot about exact kind of things. 

32
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:47,160
 >> We're doing this course. 
 >> That's right, so if you get and, if 

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,980
you get stuck, post some questions, and 
if anything gets really tough field to us 

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,920
to and we'll be there as well. 
So we'll see you next week for week three 

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,280
where we'll be making audio 
visualizations. 

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,560
So, stuff to make your music players look 
better. 

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:10,514
So, I'll see you then.
