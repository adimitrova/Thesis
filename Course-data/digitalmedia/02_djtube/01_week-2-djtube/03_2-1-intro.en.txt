Hi, and welcome to week 2 of Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile 
Applications. I'm Mick. 
This is Matt and Marco. Say hello. 
So last week, we learned how to do the basics of graphics and sound. 
This week, we're going to be a little bit more advanced. 
We're going to create an application called DJ Tube. 
it's really basic, but it does run on all your mobile devices. 
So, it runs on your iphone and an on your ipad and it runs on your android device 
as well. But, we're going to make these a bit more 
advanced. We're going to learn how to play more 
than one sound at once, and manipulate the sound by changing the pitch and the 
speed, and also by maybe doing a bit of filtering. 
We're also going to learn how to create image sequences. 
So, for example, making editable videos for live VJ interaction. 
And also image sequences for doing basic animations. 
Mark is going to take you through all the graphic stuff as usual. 
Matt's going to take you through the basics of the audio. 
And then I'm going to pull it together and show you the final thing. 
And in the final piece, the DJ tube app, there's a lot of mouse interaction, and 
you can start and stop different tracks and synch them up together. 
so you'll be learning how to synchronize different audio tracks as well, and play 
them back so they're all tightly synchronized and connected to the vision. 
so yeah, okay, we'll start with Marco [SOUND] [MUSIC].
