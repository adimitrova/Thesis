Hi, and welcome to week 2 of Creative 

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,878
Programming for Digital Media and Mobile 
Applications. 

3
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:26,911
I'm Mick. 
This is Matt and Marco. 

4
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,887
Say hello. 
So last week, we learned how to do the 

5
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:33,630
basics of graphics and sound. 
This week, we're going to be a little bit 

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,120
more advanced. 
We're going to create an application 

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,120
called DJ Tube. 
it's really basic, but it does run on all 

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,595
your mobile devices. 
So, it runs on your iphone and an on your 

9
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,960
ipad and it runs on your android device 
as well. 

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,800
But, we're going to make these a bit more 
advanced. 

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,140
We're going to learn how to play more 
than one sound at once, and manipulate 

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,820
the sound by changing the pitch and the 
speed, and also by maybe doing a bit of 

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,650
filtering. 
We're also going to learn how to create 

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,450
image sequences. 
So, for example, making editable videos 

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,490
for live VJ interaction. 
And also image sequences for doing basic 

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,830
animations. 
Mark is going to take you through all the 

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,260
graphic stuff as usual. 
Matt's going to take you through the 

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,210
basics of the audio. 
And then I'm going to pull it together 

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,610
and show you the final thing. 
And in the final piece, the DJ tube app, 

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,010
there's a lot of mouse interaction, and 
you can start and stop different tracks 

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,470
and synch them up together. 
so you'll be learning how to synchronize 

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,940
different audio tracks as well, and play 
them back so they're all tightly 

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,470
synchronized and connected to the vision. 
so yeah, okay, we'll start with Marco

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:35,470
