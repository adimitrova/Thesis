[SOUND]. 
[MUSIC]. Well, that's the end of week two. 
and I hope that was interesting, and useful. 
A bit more complicated than last week, don't you think? 
 >> Yeah, for sure. so we're really trying to combine these 
different elements, and, and work with a lot of different data here. 
So you, so you figured out how to work with sequences, and images, and how to 
play two sounds at the same time. >> Mm. 
 >> So you're really making, these, these applications more complex. 
And also I hope a lot more fun to, to interact with. 
So what can you do? I'll put these apps in, in your friend's 
hands and get them to play with them. >> Whacka, whacka. 
Yeah, yeah, and maybe make some YouTube videos and stuff. 
That's always fun. make a video with some terrible techno o 
VJ behavior. What about, yeah maybe try to play more 
than one sound at once, as well. [CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Work with images. >> Yeah. 
 >> Work with images because, ye, well now you've got images in there, you've 
got a much richer visual feel, much more varied than you can. 
 >> Mm. >> I mean, the Drawing command's 
impressing and really powerful, but once you've got images, there's the, it's the 
richness of the real world that you can bring into it. 
 >> And you can get loads of images, can't you? 
 >> Yeah. >> Off stuff like the internet archive, 
and things like that. And again you should use the forums if 
you want, if you got any questions. We have our students on there. 
Students who are on degree programs in creative computing, students who, you 
know, doing various kind of ghost less type stuff, you know, very creative, very 
energetic, good engineers as well, good programmers. 
 >> Technically they know their stuff. >> Yeah. 
 >> Also they've got lots of experience in audio visual work so they, they know, 
a lot about exact kind of things. >> We're doing this course. 
 >> That's right, so if you get and, if you get stuck, post some questions, and 
if anything gets really tough field to us to and we'll be there as well. 
So we'll see you next week for week three where we'll be making audio 
visualizations. So, stuff to make your music players look 
better. So, I'll see you then.
