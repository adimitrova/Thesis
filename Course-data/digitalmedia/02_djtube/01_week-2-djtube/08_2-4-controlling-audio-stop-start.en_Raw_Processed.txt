sound 
music 
okay so weve created a slider 
allows us to vary speed 
playback, you saw that theres 
immediately quite pleasing creative 
effects you achieve that 
we want to is add another 
control is to play stop 
sound, so we completely switch 

switch back 
a little bit complicated, 
youre going to a button 
so well basically make top part 
screen a button switch 
play back 
well make bottom part 
screen slider that we used 
earlier 
heres sketch slider 
so first im going to go to 
trigger this code 
if mouse y position is greater 
height 
okay so if in bottom half 
screen, wee in bottom half 
screen itll operate speed 
slider 
im also going to to make 
obvious that thats, thats 
there 
im going to draw a rectangle in 
bottom half screen, 
color current speed 
lets leave grayscale now, 
im working much graphics 
in this session 
so well a grayscale color 
so you remember, color is in range 
to weve got this ratio, isnt 
to 
so, we something like, ratio 
times, 
approximately, give us, a gray scale 
based on, the, range 
slider 
so rectangle needs to position 
takes half the, bottom half 
screen 
so we go zero zero height two, 
so starts far left 
screen, halfway down, goes to 
far right screen 
therefore size is width 
screen height is height 
screen two 
so remember thats x y position 
thats width square, 
thats height 
so lets double check that, thats 
working we carry 
okay, so ive got, cannot find symbol 
lets see if we debug that 
so im referring to a variable called 
ratio 
ratio get defined 
well, inside if statement 
so that means that ratio, ive 
declared there float ratio, that 
that variable is local to if 
function 
so okay to use 
outside if function 
so i is take like that 
and, so im declaring if 
statement, i using outside 
if statement thats fine 
okay, so i a problem here, 
ive forgotten to put a there 
okay, see that, see that 
highlighting line that 
problem 
quite communicative the, 
errors in code 
music sss okay 
so you see slide is 
displaying a color, represents 
speed 
so i need to quickly add a bottom 
top screen, deals with, 
deals stopping 
starting 
first all, i going to draw 
button 
so i will do, ill choose whether to 
draw red green, based state 
a boolean 
so we create a boolean called buttonon, 
we start buttonon equals 
false 
so button starts 
if button on, so well represent 
button a state 

a switch so i use a boolean 
a true a false 
booleans used quite extensively 
in controlling state programs 
way things either 
so button is on, ill set fill 
color to 
red 
otherwise, ill set to 
green 
you guess 
okay 
so, i draw rectangle 
this one starts 
this one starts , goes to, 
size is size 
one so width, height 
okay, i need to manage 
if press mouse, if mouse is 
pressed, i need to update this data 
that button 
so i need to check is if mouse y 
is less height 
in words if theyre in top half 
screen, is im 
going to be, i set, i toggle value 
to bottom button equals 
this is to toggle a boolean 
sound, ill use this operator here, 
exclamation mark 
thatll switch button to whatever 
opposite state is 
so if true itll switch to false 
if false itll switch to true 
then, im going to change state 
player 
so if button is i want player 
to play 
remove that line 
otherwise, i want player to stop 
okay, lets clean that a bit 
remember, you always also 
format 
ctrlt, applet, depending youre 
using 
okay 
so, basically, if in region 
button, is top half 
screen, we switch state 
button, we look 
current state button is now, 
update player to either stop or, 
play, based that 
we draw button either 
red green depending states in 
draw function 
so lets roll that 
okay, i cant spell button 
bu 
so highlighted line a little 
examination that line showed that i 
mistyped name variable 
music theres button, switching 

music so even a dj could operate this 
interface 
music music im a dj, you 
tell 
there you go 
so theres a simple interface 
allows you to control speed 
playback state an audio player 
music music
