hi, and welcome to week 2 of creative  programming for digital media and mobile  applications.
i'm mick.
this is matt and marco.
say hello.
so last week, we learned how to do the  basics of graphics and sound.
this week, we're going to be a little bit  more advanced.
we're going to create an application  called dj tube.
it's really basic, but it does run on all  your mobile devices.
so, it runs on your iphone and an on your  ipad and it runs on your android device  as well.
but, we're going to make these a bit more  advanced.
we're going to learn how to play more  than one sound at once, and manipulate  the sound by changing the pitch and the  speed, and also by maybe doing a bit of  filtering.
we're also going to learn how to create  image sequences.
so, for example, making editable videos  for live vj interaction.
and also image sequences for doing basic  animations.
mark is going to take you through all the  graphic stuff as usual.
matt's going to take you through the  basics of the audio.
and then i'm going to pull it together  and show you the final thing.
and in the final piece, the dj tube app,  there's a lot of mouse interaction, and  you can start and stop different tracks  and synch them up together.
so you'll be learning how to synchronize  different audio tracks as well, and play  them back so they're all tightly  synchronized and connected to the vision.
so yeah, okay, we'll start with marco  [sound] [music].
