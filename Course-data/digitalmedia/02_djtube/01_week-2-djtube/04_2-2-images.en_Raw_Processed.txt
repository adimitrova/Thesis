sound 
this week, im going to talk images 
to display in processing 
in later weeks, im going to go a 
lot detail images 
represented, today mostly 
laying images well 
look to create animations 
sequence images 
so if you look slides here, weve 
got an image taken a sequence that 
mick prepared dj app, dj app, 
im going to show you you would 
display this kind image in processing 
so, matthew, last week, talked you 
loading sound files 
playing 
in many ways, loading images is 
similar 
you something called a pimage object 
uh,which represents image you 
load that file 
so you is you create a variable 
type pimage you load that in based 
file name that image 
matthew noted last week, that 
go in data folder 
processing sketch 
like, like audio files 
that matthew talked 
so youve got pimage there, 
displaying is simple, you use 
image command 
so image command, that is 
draws image that youve loaded in, 
you call that in draw 
method 
you normally load file in setup 
so main parameter image command 
takes is obviously image youre 
going to display 
you see here that takes two 
images 
to parameters 
two numbers that give 
position you want to draw 
image 
in fact you pass yet another two 
numbers, is size image 
default draws image 
actual size in pixels 
you adjust that to size you 
want passing in a width a height 
so, ive said that you give 
position an image, that 
actually mean, an image is a big 
thing mean an image to 
asked to take a pick 
turns you actually define 
that means in a number ways 
default, is an image mode called 
corner 
so, here im showing you command, 
image mode, specifies you draw 
an image 
default thats set to corner 
that means is that position 
image is top left 
image 
sign red dot here 
so if i to call a image 
position top left image 
will point screen 
you also use imagemode center 
means that you must position 
image based middle image, 
often thats convenient 
often intuitive to think it, 
center image position, 
so in this case, if i to call 
image zero zero center image 
would zero, zero, is top 
left screen 
is probably even you want 
if you would set, to set position 
to something else you could get an you 
could position well 
so im going to talk a little bit 
positioning images 
first lets a look an example 
this working in practice 
so this is a simple processing 
sketch that involves loading 
displaying an image 
im creating top sketch 
here a p image variable 
im loading that in file 
im here, im something clever, im 
setting size screen to 
exactly size 
image 
so im using image width 
imadge dot height, to find width 
height screen here im 
drawing image position , 
there we displaying an 
image 
i move image changing 
positions im parsing in 
i change size im going to 
show you here that you to a 
little bit careful if i set 
size to , im maintaining 
aspect ratio 
image, so im squishing 
so the, youve gotta careful to make 
sure youre always keeping ratio 
width height, otherwise 
youre going to get a squished 
stretched image 
one nice way that is, is this, 
im noise so here im, so here im 
calculating a height 
image that maintains aspect 
ratio based width 
im setting width to 
im is, im taking that 
width multiplying 
height, dividing height 
image dividing width 
image 
that multiply height divide 
width maintains ratio between 
width heights image 
so this image height is right height 
so thats image is width 
isnt washed stretched 
okay last thing i showed you 
image mode 
so i set imagemode corner 
imagemode corner doesnt change anything 
so if i there, exactly 

i going to leave a little bit 
to make clear i 
if i move image mode sensor would 
different 
actually lets, lets draw 
mouse position, will clear 
whats happening 
so im drawing image 
position mouse, center 
image is mouse position 
if i corner 
top left image is mouse 
position 
okay, lets a look a little bit 
to lay images nicely, 
to use commands to get 
right sort layout feeling, is 
so getting a correct layout your, 
screen is really an important part 
getting app to look nice 
so you need to think a little 
bit 
maybe well talk this a little 

in lesson today 
lets look to this 
so, this is an example 
so, if we look this big rectangle is 
processing window, we draw an 
image point box 
now, one basic things you 
might want to 
is sent to image in screen either 
right in middle centered in 
, dimension often sent to 
horizontally 
thats here 
so im using image mode center, im 
drawing position 
box width divided two 
width divided two is half width 
screen 
so, halfway across screen 
so, im going to send to horizontally 
i want near top vertically, 
top 
so, i dont want zero 
im going to add a little margin 
so, margin is two that small value, 
pixels 
that moves to, adds a little edge 
between top screen 
window 
examples 
so if i want to lay things in 
columns 
well, here still relative to 
middle screen 
so we want to position relative to 
middle screen, we want to put 
one side middle 
screen 
so, we want moved middle 
screen in a certain margin 
we add a little margin 
mid, in, width 
image divided 
so width image divided is 
half width image 
thats half center image 
essentially moving image in 
center first margin 
half width 
so half way into, so the, 
in center amount given 
margin 
we exactly thing 
vertically 
we move half height, 
so half way screen, add a 
margin, add imageheight 
divided to move half 
height 
if we were, that imageheight two is 
there image mid 
comma, so specifying 
center image is 
so, thats kind thing you might 
want to do, youre looking 
positioning images, you need to think 
relative to points screen, like 
halfway point screen, width 
divided two, height divided two 
you want to add a little bit a margin 
to sort give a bit space to 
layout, you may want to 
shift around size image, 
half size image 
mick will show you a number 
examples that 
so going to look about, 
to create animations sequence 
images 
so is an animation 
an animation is essentially something 
that moves time 
looking film 
computer animation, really talking 
a sequence frames time 
so true movement, a, a 
sequence individual images that 
present one another 
this goes back to glory days 
disney animation 
form until animation 
always placed a number images 
along a timeline 
so we always think this 
image 
this is image , this is image , 
a moment in time 
talking real images, 
looks something like this 
we a sequence images 
in real animation we many 
to make sure we smooth 
movements, im showing this an 
example 
we lay in order so we have, 
we play sequentially one 

if we play fast enough, that 
gives us illusion movement 
so a technical level in processing, 
we need to is to able to 
collect together a large number images 
play one 
quickly 
now,thats something a little bit 
different we last 
week, so last week, we created a program 
we sort set running 
we interacted it, we we 
mouse drag, mouse movements, 
mouse movements resulted in changes 
to state program, changes to 
drawn, that we could see 
playing in animation, we 
want stuff to happen independently 
whether drawing stuff 
we want to play along 
so, responding to mouse drag 
mouse pressed events 
we need program to thing 
independently 
and, we use is a method called draw, 
this is a really fundamental part 
processing, this is, a method that is 
called every frame to times a 
second 
is used to draw a new image time 
time time 
changing images 
slightly time we get illusion 
animation 
so in draw method, going to 
draw image, 
draw method automatically repeats 
repeats repeats 
so that we get that illusion 
animation 
we cant obviously drawing 
image every time 
we need a lot images 
to represent a large number images, we 
use a data structure called an array 
now, if youre already familiar 
programming, youre probably familiar 
arrays 
if youre familiar them, 
please look additional lecture 
ive put arrays 
okay, we create an array an array is 
a large block memory that a 
numbered sequence elements 
so weve got an array images 
so weve got a bunch images 
number in order 
sound way arrays work we 
start 
so you 
image , image , image , image 
thing we need is to able to 
keep track we in image 
sequence 
which, image we cant reclaim 
to that, we keep in variable 
is number current image 
an int a whole 
number to that, that image sequence 
so we got this variable current image 
is keeping track we are, 
we, we draw a frame 
so we, in draw method 
we draw current image 
we use image command, anim 
currentimage, hold position in 
there that weve put a position in there 
that will draw image we 
currently playing 
so, thats basics we 
need to 
thing is that 
actually animating nothing is 
changing 
so core to animation is that every 
frame we something, something 
to change 
so that we get a new image 
in this case simple 
we need to is move to next 
image 
we that is simply add one to 
current image available 
so that image steps onto next 
one 
youll note im going to use this syntax 
current image plus equals that 
means adding if youre familiar 
price signal java syntax 
so, time draw is called, so every 
frame, times a second, adding 
one to current image 
so im moving to next image, 
displaying that one 
moving to next image, displaying 
that one, next one 
carry 
to large number images in examples 
well looking at, sort of, a 
hundred images 
so, this is an example 
program would look like in setup 
we, we create our, array 
images, we start current image 
zero 
in draw, we draw current imagethat 
gives us currentimage 
we add to 
we still use things, like 
mousepressed mousedragged to control 
playback 
example, we press mouse we 
could set current image to zero 
would reset playing 
beginning 
i show you example, i want to 
go one last thin, is looping 
so fine adding one to current 
position 
happens we get to end 
array 
we run images 
if we try to access an image thats 
in way 
so thats, so getting a current 
position is number 
images weve got 
well get an error, program will 
crash 
so we need to something that 
we could stop animation, a 
common thing we might want to is loop 
so, this is an example 
codes 
if we check if current position 
is length image 
if is, we set current position 
back to zero so we reset back to zero 
so, lets a look that in practice 
so here is animation sketch, i 
written a little example 
function that loads images 
you that in example pack 
you dont to rewrite that 
we load images, passing in an im, 
image format 
so this is name will look like this, 
movie number jpg, this 
is number images 
we frame will display 
image 
we add one to it, we go back to 
beginning leave 
mouse press will reset to 
so, mouse press function, 
we set to , mouse gets 
first 
so i restart mouse 
buttons pressed otherwise will 
play in a loop, animation 
theres one last thing id like to cover, 
is playing pausing an 
animation 
so sometimes you want to stop 
animation temporarilty restart 
to that, we use whats called a 
boolean variable so thats a variable 
that take two values, true 
false 
acts like an onoff switch, so, 
playing is true, means 
we playing 
playing is false, means 
playing 
we use this boolean variable 
input an if statement like this 
we use, if playing 
that means if playing is true 
we move currentimage 
if playing is true, 
nothing 
so this is is controlling playing 
we turn playing 
in mousepressed, i using 
clever here, called operator 
that, that is takes a 
boolean variable, 
opposite 
so switches, taking playing here 
switching it, accessing to 
opposite playing 
so if playing is false, will become 
true 
if playing is true, will become false 
i will show you that works in 
practice, here 
so weve got a, a processing sketch 
again, loads images, we a 
boolean variable here, weve wrapped 
playing code in an in an if statement 
in unknown toggling so 
turning playing true to flase 
flase to true 
i click to turn 
like this 
okay, so matthews going to tell you a 
little bit work in audio 
that we need todays lesson 
well, mick will show you an example 
to use this to create a vjr music
