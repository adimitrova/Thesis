[BLANK AUDIO]. [SOUND]. I have to say that sounds really good. 
I'm the one here who isn't a musician, so I can't say much about it, but Matt what 
is it about that synth that makes it sound well? 
 >> He doesn't care. >> He doesn't care. 
 >> He doesn't care, he's playing. I'm not going to, you know, I'm not 
going to say anything. >> I just love this mate, I think it's 
amazing. >> Cool. 
 >> so we've given you something great here. 
You, you really need to, to, to work on this, and, and make it into something 
individual to put your own sounds in there. 
To, to see if you can experiment with, with the length of the sequences. 
 >> Yeah. And you can stick your own waveforms in. 
You can change all the sequence lengths. You could do a proper GUI rather than 
that bleak affair. I quite like it bleak. 
It's all post-nuclear TV 303. >> You might, you might try and make it 
like like a vintage drum machine. You could get, get an image of a vintage 
drum machine as you saw in my slides and you could put that behind it, put the 
buttons on top. There's all kinds of stuff you can do, 
you know, you can really get creative with this. 
 >> Remember you can use images for the buttons, so that's an easy thing to do. 
 >> Yeah, the I quite like the filter, the thing about the web audio equalizer, 
it has a really, really nice filter. And I want us to get in. 
 >> Okay, come on then. So, this is really taking me back. 
I mean it's, you know. >> [LAUGH]. 
It's that kind of where's it gone? Where's the sound gone? 
 >> It's right here. It's right here. 
 >> Oh, there we go. Yeah. 
[SOUND]. It's just that filter cut off thing, and 
with the envelope. Well, that's neat. 
 >> We can really, we can really dig around and get into that kind of 
[UNKOWN]. >> So, that's it for Digital Media and 
Mobile Applications. And we've been teaching you how to do 
creative programming. We've tried to make it as easy for you to 
get started as possible, regardless of your background. 
And give you lots of opportunities to develop your skills both creatively and 
also technically. You know, we've created a bunch of 
programming, languages and libraries. Well, not languages as such, just 
libraries that make it easier for you to do the things that you want to do. 
and I think that's been quite good. It's been successful. 
They've got a physics engine, they've got a music engine, they've got, what else 
have they got? They've got Facebook stuff. 
All this different stuff. And you can just go away. 
And if you're interested in following this up and doing some more, but you feel 
like you want to do some if you, well, let's say you want to be more creative, 
at [UNKNOWN]. We run a digital loss computing program 
which is a combination with the arts department. 
that's [UNKNOWN] art department so that program is kicking off right now and you 
apply for that more or less in the next couple of months. 
 >> we also have a Master's program in Computational Arts, and a Master's in 
Fine Art and Computational Arts, if you're more creative. 
We also have a BSC in Creative Computing as well, don't we, Marco? 
 >> Yeah. That's running in London, but it's also 
running internationally as part of the University of London International 
Programs. >> Yes. 
 >> So, wherever you are, you can actually take that program. 
 >> Yeah, and this is a good starting off point plan. 
 >> Yeah. >> Yeah, yeah. 
 >> And that's really what it's been about. 
Thank you very much for still being here through all of the coding help. 
And but, actually, you know what? It's exciting when it works and that's 
what makes it worthwhile. >> Yeah, and this is so much great 
stuff, just combine together all of the stuff we have shown you like mix it up, 
figure out what new things you can do with all the taught we have given you. 
 >> And then, send it to us, because we want to see. 
 >> Yeah. >> We really want to see what you're 
doing. >> We'd love to see what you're doing. 
And we want to hear some more music. Matt, do you got anything. 
 >> Yeah, music. [MUSIC]. Matt's actually very, very good at synth 
stuff. I built this for you, it's true. 
 >> I just love this, it's brilliant, brilliant work. 
Have fun. [MUSIC].
