[
sound
]
so
it
's
week
six
.
and
as
you
know
we
're
doing
audio
applications
.
the
thing
about
music
and
interactive
music
is
it
's
much
more
accessible
than
it
's
ever
been
.
and
now
it
's
really
quite
good
fun
making
interactive
music
applications
that
run
on
your
iphone
,
your
ipad
or
your
android
devices
.
because
there
's
so
many
people
who
want
to
use
them
.
and
i
thought
as
well
as
showing
you
a
really
easy
way
of
making
a
very
,
very
cool
scent
,
which
is
what
we
're
going
to
do
in
a
moment
,
and
incorporating
some
of
the
stuff
that
matt
's
been
talking
about
i
thought
it
'd
be
really
good
if
i
got
want
to
my
friends
martin
.
so
come
and
talk
to
you
so
yeah
basically
this
is
martin
roth
,
and
he
's
director
of
research
at
a
company
called
rjdj
.
so
rjdj
specialize
in
interactive
audio
applications
on
mobile
devices
.
so
yeah
martin
can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
some
of
the
applications
that
you
guys
have
made
.
>
>
absolutely
mick
thank
you
.
well
our
first
app
was
back
in
2008
and
we
started
off
with
the
original
rjdj
app
.
and
that
was
really
one
of
the
first
times
anyone
on
a
mass
scale
had
been
able
to
interact
with
their
music
.
you
were
able
to
download
what
we
call
the
seen
.
it
was
basically
an
interactive
user
track
onto
you
iphone
.
and
then
interact
with
it
either
through
the
microphone
or
by
tilting
the
phone
around
or
the
accelerometer
would
influence
what
you
were
listening
to
.
or
perhaps
,
we
can
use
the
internet
to
find
out
things
about
what
,
what
was
going
on
around
you
for
instance
what
the
was
like
.
>
>
mm-hm
>
>
so
,
you
can
imagine
that
you
were
walking
down
the
street
.
and
the
music
that
you
were
listening
to
,
would
change
tempo
,
according
to
how
fast
you
were
moving
.
so
if
you
were
moving
slowly
then
the
music
might
be
,
you
know
might
also
have
a
relatively
low
tempo
,
it
might
be
a
little
bit
relaxed
,
little
chill
.
but
then
if
you
started
running
not
only
would
the
tempo
pick
up
,
but
you
could
also
change
the
energy
in
the
music
and
it
would
become
much
more
energetic
,
much
more
exciting
,
much
more
thrilling
.
>
>
so
what
kind
of
stuff
did
you
do
?
because
i
've
seen
some
of
the
earlier
apps
as
well
.
>
>
yeah
.
>
>
but
you
've
obviously
done
some
quite
large
scale
apps
that
have
movie
tie-ins
.
>
>
yeah
,
that
's
right
.
one
of
the
first
movie
tie-in
apps
that
we
did
was
called
inception
,
and
that
came
out
a
the
end
of
2010
,
along
with
,
alongside
the
dvd
release
of
the
film
.
the
inception
app
worked
extremely
well
with
the
film
,
because
the
film
is
all
about
dreams
,
it
was
about
going
to
dreams
within
dreams
,
and
then
losing
yourself
a
bit
in
this
,
in
the
dream
environment
.
and
certainly
one
thing
that
the
kinds
of
,
the
kinds
of
music
that
we
were
making
at
the
time
,
one
thing
that
it
lent
itself
very
well
to
,
was
a
kind
of
dream
,
psychedelic
experience
.
worked
incredibly
well
.
some
people
were
in
fact
really
worried
that
if
they
went
to
sleep
with
this
thing
on
then
they
would
never
wake
up
.
[
laugh
]
it
was
a
real
customer
complaint
.
[
cough
]
.
>
>
yeah
,
certainly
.
but
since
then
we
have
also
done
other
movie
tie-ins
such
as
with
the
dark
knight
,
and
there
are
even
some
new
ones
coming
on
down
the
pipe
line
.
>
>
that
is
really
cool
.
so
,
so
that
's
what
main
stream
that
interactive
and
reactive
music
there
.
>
>
yeah
,
absolutely
and
i
think
it
's
something
that
will
become
even
more
mainstream
in
,
in
the
coming
years
.
the
philosophy
behind
rjdj
is
always
been
that
for
the
last
year
many
decades
music
has
been
frozen
.
we
record
music
,
we
import
it
to
some
medium
,
whether
it
be
vinyl
,
cassette
,
cd
or
these
days
mp3
.
but
once
you
've
made
the
recording
of
that
music
,
it
's
done
,
it
stays
like
that
forever
.
and
every
time
that
you
go
back
and
listen
to
that
piece
of
music
,
it
's
exactly
the
same
.
but
with
the
technology
that
we
have
in
the
palm
of
our
hands
today
,
we
can
do
so
much
more
.
not
only
can
we
allow
the
,
the
musician
to
give
their
fans
all
of
the
different
variations
that
they
have
in
mind
for
a
piece
of
music
,
but
we
can
allow
the
fans
to
explore
all
of
those
different
variations
themselves
.
>
>
right
.
>
>
for
instance
,
you
can
imagine
as
with
video
games
,
where
you
can
go
and
you
are
driving
the
plot
,
you
are
driving
what
happens
and
you
can
go
and
explore
the
scene
of
the
.
the
video
game
developers
have
created
.
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
give
the
same
opportunity
to
musicians
.
>
>
yeah
right
.
it
's
interesting
as
well
because
the
landscapes
changing
is
n't
it
a
little
bit
from
a
development
particularly
in
terms
of
audio
.
because
of
the
web
audio
api
,
so
we
're
using
it
as
part
of
this
coursera
program
instead
of
doing
native
coding
for
audio
on
the
,
on
our
devices
.
when
you
think
about
it
,
you
think
it
's
a
good
step
forward
?
>
>
oh
,
absolutely
i
love
the
web
audio
api
.
in
the
past
we
've
done
everything
natively
of
course
.
we
needed
the
performance
.
but
now
,
that
the
web
audio
api
's
coming
along
and
it
's
been
standardized
to
some
degree
,
and
it
certainly
seen
support
across
not
only
desk
top
browsers
but
also
mobile
browsers
.
>
>
mm-hm
.
>
>
it
gives
it
gives
the
developer
the
opportunity
to
develop
their
audio
experience
once
.
and
truly
be
able
to
deliver
it
to
many
platforms
without
having
to
do
a
lot
of
work
in
order
to
adapt
your
code
whether
your
experienced
to
any
one
particular
platform
.
>
>
yeah
,
and
so
i
think
we
've
found
it
really
useful
for
delivering
this
program
.
>
>
mm-hm
.
>
>
but
also
i
think
we
've
got
ta
kind
of
of
there
's
an
instinct
about
what
's
going
to
happen
.
now
that
the
web
audio
api
is
there
.
you
can
just
sense
this
huge
amount
of
music
interactive
music
,
and
reactive
music
and
music
instruments
on
the
web
.
this
huge
kind
of
number
of
applications
just
about
to
spill
over
>
>
oh
for
sure
.
>
>
it
's
almost
as
if
[
inaudible
]
yeah
.
>
>
i
would
say
right
now
people
are
really
experimenting
,
they
're
trying
to
figure
out
what
's
possible
like
through
this
course
.
>
>
mm
.
>
>
once
people
become
more
comfortable
with
the
technology
,
once
they
understand
,
what
can
they
do
with
it
?
what
are
the
limits
?
and
then
once
they
start
pushing
those
limits
,
i
'm
extremely
excited
.
>
>
yeah
.
>
>
extremely
excited
.
>
>
well
,
that
's
great
.
i
really
appreciate
you
coming
down
and
talking
to
us
.
i
know
that
you
're
very
busy
,
and
you
got
to
shoot
off
now
and
talk
to
some
other
music
types
.
but
yeah
.
we
are
going
to
go
through
some
of
our
some
of
our
web
audio
api
kind
of
based
synthesis
stuff
now
,
and
,
and
yeah
,
i
just
kind
of
of
,
we
're
just
going
to
give
you
a
quick
burst
of
what
it
sounds
like
and
then
kind
of
,
you
know
.
yeah
,
this
is
the
one
.
so
this
is
the
app
that
we
're
going
to
be
talking
about
.
[
music
]
so
you
get
the
picture
.
[
music
]
so
that
's
what
we
're
working
on
today
.
>
>
mick
,
thank
you
very
much
for
inviting
me
.
>
>
that
's
great
.
>
>
you
're
a
true
musician
,
gentleman
and
scholar
.
>
>
[
laugh
]
yeah
,
well
,
that
's
what
they
all
say
.
[
music
