[blank audio].
[sound].
i have to say that sounds really good.
i'm the one here who isn't a musician, so  i can't say much about it, but matt what  is it about that synth that makes it  sound well?
>> he doesn't care.
>> he doesn't care.
>> he doesn't care, he's playing.
i'm not going to, you know, i'm not  going to say anything.
>> i just love this mate, i think it's  amazing.
>> cool.
>> so we've given you something great  here.
you, you really need to, to, to work on  this, and, and make it into something  individual to put your own sounds in  there.
to, to see if you can experiment with,  with the length of the sequences.
>> yeah.
and you can stick your own waveforms in.
you can change all the sequence lengths.
you could do a proper gui rather than  that bleak affair.
i quite like it bleak.
it's all post-nuclear tv 303.
>> you might, you might try and make it  like like a vintage drum machine.
you could get, get an image of a vintage  drum machine as you saw in my slides and  you could put that behind it, put the  buttons on top.
there's all kinds of stuff you can do,  you know, you can really get creative  with this.
>> remember you can use images for the  buttons, so that's an easy thing to do.
>> yeah, the i quite like the filter,  the thing about the web audio equalizer,  it has a really, really nice filter.
and i want us to get in.
>> okay, come on then.
so, this is really taking me back.
i mean it's, you know.
>> [laugh].
it's that kind of where's it gone?
where's the sound gone?
>> it's right here.
it's right here.
>> oh, there we go.
yeah.
[sound].
it's just that filter cut off thing, and  with the envelope.
well, that's neat.
>> we can really, we can really dig  around and get into that kind of  [unkown].
>> so, that's it for digital media and  mobile applications.
and we've been teaching you how to do  creative programming.
we've tried to make it as easy for you to  get started as possible, regardless of  your background.
and give you lots of opportunities to  develop your skills both creatively and  also technically.
you know, we've created a bunch of  programming, languages and libraries.
well, not languages as such, just  libraries that make it easier for you to  do the things that you want to do.
and i think that's been quite good.
it's been successful.
they've got a physics engine, they've got  a music engine, they've got, what else  have they got?
they've got facebook stuff.
all this different stuff.
and you can just go away.
and if you're interested in following  this up and doing some more, but you feel  like you want to do some if you, well,  let's say you want to be more creative,  at [unknown].
we run a digital loss computing program  which is a combination with the arts  department.
that's [unknown] art department so that  program is kicking off right now and you  apply for that more or less in the next  couple of months.
>> we also have a master's program in  computational arts, and a master's in  fine art and computational arts, if  you're more creative.
we also have a bsc in creative computing  as well, don't we, marco?
>> yeah.
that's running in london, but it's also  running internationally as part of the  university of london international  programs.
>> yes.
>> so, wherever you are, you can  actually take that program.
>> yeah, and this is a good starting  off point plan.
>> yeah.
>> yeah, yeah.
>> and that's really what it's been  about.
thank you very much for still being here  through all of the coding help.
and but, actually, you know what?
it's exciting when it works and that's  what makes it worthwhile.
>> yeah, and this is so much great  stuff, just combine together all of the  stuff we have shown you like mix it up,  figure out what new things you can do  with all the taught we have given you.
>> and then, send it to us, because we  want to see.
>> yeah.
>> we really want to see what you're  doing.
>> we'd love to see what you're doing.
and we want to hear some more music.
matt, do you got anything.
>> yeah, music.
[music].
matt's actually very, very good at synth  stuff.
i built this for you, it's true.
>> i just love this, it's brilliant,  brilliant work.
have fun.
[music].
