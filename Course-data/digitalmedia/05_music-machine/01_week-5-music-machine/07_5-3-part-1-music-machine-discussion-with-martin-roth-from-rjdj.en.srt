1
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:09,375
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:18,961
it's week six.

3
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:22,527
And as you know we're
doing audio applications.

4
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,349
The thing about music and

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:29,570
interactive music is it's much more
accessible than it's ever been.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,970
And now it's really quite good fun making
interactive music applications that

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,420
run on your iPhone, your iPad or
your Android devices.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,080
Because there's so
many people who want to use them.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,980
And I thought as well as showing
you a really easy way of

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,210
making a very,very cool scent, which is
what we're going to do in a moment, and

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,900
incorporating some of the stuff that
Matt's been talking about I thought it'd

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,480
be really good if I got
want to my friends Martin.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,000
So come and talk to you so
yeah basically this is Martin Roth, and

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,670
he's director of research
at a company called RJDJ.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,580
So RJDJ specialize in interactive
audio applications on mobile devices.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,840
So yeah Martin can you tell us a little
bit about some of the applications that

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,870
you guys have made.

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,640
>> Absolutely Mick thank you.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,370
Well our first app was back in 2008 and
we started off with the original RJDJ app.

20
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,610
And that was really one of the first times
anyone on a mass scale had been able to

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,020
interact with their music.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,590
You were able to download
what we call the seen.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,970
It was basically an interactive
user track onto you iPhone.

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,360
And then interact with it either through
the microphone or by tilting the phone

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,260
around or the accelerometer would
influence what you were listening to.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,610
Or perhaps, we can use the internet
to find out things about what,

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,960
what was going on around you for
instance what the was like.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,170
>> Mm-hm
>> So, you can imagine that you

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,720
were walking down the street.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,240
And the music that you were listening to,

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,230
would change tempo,
according to how fast you were moving.

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,750
So if you were moving slowly then the
music might be, you know might also have

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,930
a relatively low tempo, it might be
a little bit relaxed, little chill.

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,110
But then if you started running not
only would the tempo pick up, but

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,370
you could also change
the energy in the music and

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,980
it would become much more energetic,
much more exciting, much more thrilling.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,730
>> So what kind of stuff did you do?

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,180
Because I've seen some of
the earlier apps as well.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,310
>> Yeah.
>> But you've obviously done some

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,110
quite large scale apps
that have movie tie-ins.

41
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,820
>> Yeah, that's right.

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,570
One of the first movie tie-in apps that
we did was called Inception, and that

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,912
came out a the end of 2010, along with,
alongside the DVD release of the film.

44
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,532
The Inception app worked
extremely well with the film,

45
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:37,378
because the film is all about dreams, it
was about going to dreams within dreams,

46
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,060
and then losing yourself a bit in this,
in the dream environment.

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,300
And certainly one thing that the kinds of,
the kinds of music that we were

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,830
making at the time, one thing that it lent
itself very well to, was a kind of dream,

49
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,590
psychedelic experience.

50
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,910
Worked incredibly well.

51
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,680
Some people were in fact really worried
that if they went to sleep with

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,685
this thing on then they
would never wake up.

53
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:00,312
[LAUGH] It was a real customer complaint.

54
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,581
[COUGH].

55
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,550
>> Yeah, certainly.

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,760
But since then we have also done
other movie tie-ins such as with

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,440
the Dark Knight, and there are even some
new ones coming on down the pipe line.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
>> That is really cool.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,380
So, so that's what main stream that
interactive and reactive music there.

60
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,190
>> Yeah, absolutely and

61
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,986
I think it's something that will
become even more mainstream in,

62
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,450
in the coming years.

63
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,250
The philosophy behind RJDJ
is always been that for

64
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,810
the last year many decades
music has been frozen.

65
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,880
We record music,

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,810
we import it to some medium, whether it
be vinyl, cassette, cd or these days mp3.

67
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,230
But once you've made the recording
of that music, it's done,

68
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,760
it stays like that forever.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,000
And every time that you go back and

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,590
listen to that piece of music,
it's exactly the same.

71
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,810
But with the technology that we have
in the palm of our hands today,

72
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,350
we can do so much more.

73
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,500
Not only can we allow the,
the musician to give their fans all of

74
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,830
the different variations that they
have in mind for a piece of music, but

75
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,255
we can allow the fans to explore all of
those different variations themselves.

76
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,160
>> Right.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,590
>> For instance,
you can imagine as with video games,

78
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,530
where you can go and you are driving
the plot, you are driving what happens and

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,810
you can go and explore the scene of the.

80
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,640
The video game developers have created.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,240
We would like to be able to give
the same opportunity to musicians.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
>> Yeah right.

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,730
It's interesting as well because
the landscapes changing isn't it

84
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,060
a little bit from a development
Particularly in terms of audio.

85
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,420
Because of the web audio API, so we're
using it as part of this Coursera program

86
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,540
instead of doing native coding for
audio on the, on our devices.

87
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,520
When you think about it,
you think it's a good step forward?

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,290
>> Oh,
absolutely I love the web audio API.

89
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,510
In the past we've done
everything natively of course.

90
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,100
We needed the performance.

91
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,740
But now, that the web audio API's coming
along and it's been standardized to

92
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,270
some degree, and it certainly seen support
across not only desk top browsers but

93
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,970
also mobile browsers.

94
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,320
>> Mm-hm.
>> It gives it gives

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,050
the developer the opportunity to
develop their audio experience once.

96
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,140
And truly be able to deliver it to many
platforms without having to do a lot of

97
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,310
work in order to adapt your code
whether your experienced to

98
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,680
any one particular platform.

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,400
>> Yeah, and so I think we've found it
really useful for delivering this program.

100
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,920
>> Mm-hm.
>> But also I think we've gotta kind of

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,580
of there's an instinct about
what's going to happen.

102
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,890
Now that the web audio API is there.

103
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,610
You can just sense this huge
amount of music interactive music,

104
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,790
and reactive music and
music instruments on the web.

105
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,160
This huge kind of number of
applications just about to spill over

106
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,080
>> Oh for sure.

107
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,270
>> it's almost as if [INAUDIBLE] yeah.

108
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,460
>> I would say right now people
are really experimenting,

109
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,770
they're trying to figure out what's
possible like through this course.

110
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,670
>> Mm.
>> Once people become more

111
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,770
comfortable with the technology, once they
understand, what can they do with it?

112
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,800
What are the limits?

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,100
And then once they start pushing
those limits, I'm extremely excited.

114
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,970
>> Yeah.
>> Extremely excited.

115
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,900
>> Well, that's great.

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,590
I really appreciate you coming down and
talking to us.

117
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,360
I know that you're very busy,
and you got to shoot off now and

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,204
talk to some other music types.

119
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:03,273
But yeah.
We are going to go through some of our

120
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:07,822
some of our web audio API kind of
based synthesis stuff now, and,

121
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:11,948
and yeah, I just kind of of,
we're just going to give you

122
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:16,442
a quick burst of what it sounds like and
then kind of, you know.

123
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,649
Yeah, this is the one.

124
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,690
So this is the app that we're
going to be talking about.

125
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:29,690
[MUSIC]

126
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,629
So you get the picture.

127
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:23,725
[MUSIC]

128
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,156
So that's what we're working on today.

129
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,140
>> Mick, thank you very much for
inviting me.

130
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,395
>> That's great.
>> You're a true musician,

131
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,236
gentleman and scholar.

132
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,084
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, well,
that's what they all say.

133
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,219
[MUSIC]
