00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:21,431
So last week we introduced user 
interfaces, and I introduced you to the 

2
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:26,588
user interface library that I have. 
now this week we're going to continue 

3
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:30,416
using that to make music machine, but 
we're going to introduce one other 

4
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:34,569
feature of that library, which is 
sliders. 

5
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:42,409
so, a slider looks like this. 
It's a horizontal bar that you can click 

6
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:49,330
on and it moves across the screen, and as 
usual we can make that effect. 

7
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,252
What's going out things in the program, 
in this case you set the screen cover. 

8
00:00:53,252 --> 00:01:02,820
So, let's just see how that works. 
Now a slider works pretty similar, in a 

9
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,589
pretty similar way to the buttons that we 
saw last week. 

10
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,122
You can create a slider, give it a name. 
And this is a new thing, you need to set 

11
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:17,600
the minimum or maximum values of the 
slider. 

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Those are the minimum and maximum values 
that you can get out of a slider. 

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,955
So, the slider will have a certain size, 
just as any other user interface element. 

14
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:30,880
And it will go from the, the left of that 
slider to the right of that slider. 

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,150
And left of that slider will give you a 
minimum value, in this case zero. 

16
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,240
And the right of that slider will give 
you a maximum value. 

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,272
These are the values we're using to 
control color, which go between zero and 

18
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:44,176
255. 
If you were to control something else, 

19
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:47,912
like audio volume, you would need another 
range of, of values. 

20
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:54,300
This is quite similar to the map examples 
we used earlier. 

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,370
And we have the initial value of the 
slider. 

22
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,762
So you might want to start it at 0, but 
sometimes you want to start it at another 

23
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:03,230
value. 
Here I'm starting it at 20. 

24
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,100
These other bits are pretty much the same 
as the button. 

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,350
You give it a position, X, Y, and a size, 
width, and height. 

26
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,604
And this last this last parameter is the 
orientation of the slider, whether it's a 

27
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:21,746
horizontal slider or a vertical slider. 
You can see how we can change that. 

28
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:25,292
sliders pretty much work as, in the same 
way as buttons. 

29
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,950
You need to draw them in the display 
method, in the draw method, and you need 

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,490
to do, you need to check whether they 
have been clicked on in the mouse 

31
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,266
released method, but I'll show you the 
one other thing you need to do is get the 

32
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:42,266
value of the slider. 
So you need to know what, what the value 

33
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:47,290
of that slider is, and we can use the 
function get, the slider.get. 

34
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,841
We'll return you a floating point value, 
a number, between the minimum value and 

35
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,740
the maximum value, and then you can use 
that simple code. 

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,420
So let's see an example of doing that. 
So this is the program I ran earlier. 

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,225
We've got a slider variable, just as we 
had button variables. 

38
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,809
This is where we creating the slider. 
Can you remember these are the minimum 

39
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:12,417
and maximum values, and that's the 
initial value, we display it in the, in 

40
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:18,170
the draw method, and we call, slide it up 
mouse released. 

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,061
In the mouse released method, and this is 
where we actually make it interact with 

42
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:28,800
the rest of our program. 
We get the value of the slider and use 

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,906
that as input to our background's color, 
and let's just remind ourselves what that 

44
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:38,518
does. 
So we're getting the value of the slider, 

45
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:43,476
it's a value between 0 and 255 because 
that's what we set it to, and, and that's 

46
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:49,880
changing the background color. 
We can change your initial value. 

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
We can change our minimum value so that 
it's never going to get too dark, even 

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,120
right at the bottom it's still quite 
grey, our maximum value similarly so to 

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:17,397
stop it whiting out as it does. 
And the other thing we might want to 

50
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:22,792
change is the orientation of it, so 
currently it's drawn horizontally across 

51
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:28,738
the screen, but we can draw it vertically 
as well. 

52
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:32,772
but, I need to remember to change these 
values because. 

53
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:38,628
it's going to be a very short, fat 
vertical slider, if I draw the same size 

54
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:45,560
as the, the horizontal slider. 
So if I'm drawing a vertical slider, I 

55
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,884
need to make it's it's thin but long, as 
opposed to wide but short. 

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,418
So I'm swapping the width and height and 
there we have our vertical slider. 

57
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:02,298
Now with a button it's fine just to 
respond to clicks, but actually with a 

58
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:10,060
slider it's quite satisfying to drag 
around and you can't do it. 

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,520
Input the code as it is now, but doing it 
is very simple. 

60
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:27,947
We just create a mouse drag method and 
call s.mousedrag. 

61
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,814
And then we can drag very smoothly and 
smoothly change all the values so for you 

62
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:38,894
can just call any of mouse press, mouse 
release, mouse drags and our user 

63
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:49,992
interface for each will have equivalents. 
Now let's show you one last example of 

64
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:55,030
how to use multiple sliders together. 
Last week you saw how to create radio 

65
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,860
buttons which is a combination of 
different buttons, a series of buttons. 

66
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,536
You can do something very similar with 
sliders where you have a set of different 

67
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:12,655
sliders that, that you can interact with, 
and it looks something like this. 

68
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:18,049
So I can now set each of the color 
channels with my background individually 

69
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:25,612
so I can make it less red. 
And again, it works in a quite similar 

70
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:28,921
way. 
We have multi slider available. 

71
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:34,882
We create the multi sliders. 
Just like with radio buttons, we have to 

72
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:41,563
give it the number of sliders you want. 
In this case, we're taking it from the 

73
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:47,088
length of this string of this array of 
names, and again just like radio buttons 

74
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:53,262
we can set the names. 
and then we display it and then we do, 

75
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:57,550
mouse release to capture events, and in 
here we're getting there's no longer 

76
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,310
single gets. 
We can get the value of each individual 

77
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,650
slider, and we pass in the number of that 
slider, so it's get zero. 

78
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,660
We'll get the first slider, get one, 
second get two, we'll get third. 

79
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:22,369
So, that's how it works. 
So, get zero we'll get the value of this 

80
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:28,021
slider as I click on it 

81
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,274
[MUSIC].
