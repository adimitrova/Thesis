[NOISE].

00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:21,776
Hi and welcome to the final week of 
Creative Programming for Digital Media 

3
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:25,400
and Mobile Applications. 
This week's a bit special because it's 

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,520
the last week, but also we're going to do 
something that's a bit more fun and for 

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,202
our specialist audience and our 
specialist market. 

6
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:36,554
We are going to build a synthesizor and a 
drum machine that works on mobile devices 

7
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:41,940
and on desktop devices entirely using 
browser technology. 

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,080
So yeah, we've been working quite hard to 
get this together for you. 

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,852
Although, it's very, very simple for you 
to interact with and you should be able 

10
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:51,414
to, from this example that we're going to 
show you, go ahead and build a lot of 

11
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:54,735
your own music synthesizers and 
sequences. 

12
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:58,515
And I think this is a nice way to end 
because it shows you how we can use a GUI 

13
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:02,355
and quite complex audio ideas, sound 
ideas, and music ideas to put something 

14
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:06,075
together that's very usable for people 
who don't necessarily have a lot of 

15
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:11,892
musical skills. 
But then allows the to produce something 

16
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:15,680
which does sound musical... 
Although, having said that, it's me 

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,475
that's playing it so, you know, my goal 
whenever I try and write music software 

18
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:22,540
is to make something which I can play 
when I'm really drunk. 

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,692
so that's been my vision for this week. 
we've got Marco, who's going to be 

20
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:28,949
telling you a little bit of how to set up 
sliders. 

21
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:34,200
Particularly, sliders so you can change 
the parameters for the synthesizer. 

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,402
And then we've got Matt. 
And Matt is going to tell you that some 

23
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:41,760
of the specifics about creating a 
sequencer using processing. 

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,832
Now, it's gotta be said, processing is 
not the best language to be doing sound 

25
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:48,638
in of any kind. 
So the fact that this works at all is you 

26
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:51,674
know, is I think very useful for a lot of 
people that are interested in making 

27
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:55,450
music. 
So, we'll take you through step by step 

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,450
as always, and this week we're going to 
start with Matt, and he's going to talk 

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,243
you through basic, building a basic drum 
machine. 

30
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,550
So Matt, how does it work?
