sound 
so 
week six 
you know 
audio applications 
thing music 
interactive music is much 
accessible ever 
really quite good fun making 
interactive music applications that 
run iphone, ipad 
android devices 
theres so 
many people want to use 
i thought well showing 
you a really easy way 
making a very,very cool scent, is 
going to in a moment, 
incorporating stuff that 
matts talking i thought itd 
really good if i got 
want to friends martin 
so come talk to you so 
yeah basically this is martin roth, 
hes director research 
a company called rjdj 
so rjdj specialize in interactive 
audio applications mobile devices 
so yeah martin you tell us a little 
bit applications that 
you guys made 
absolutely mick thank you 
well first app back in 
we started original rjdj app 
that really one first times 
anyone a mass scale able to 
interact music 
you able to download 
we call seen 
basically an interactive 
user track onto you iphone 
interact either 
microphone tilting phone 
around accelerometer would 
influence you listening to 
perhaps, we use internet 
to find things what, 
going around you 
instance like 
mmhm 
so, you imagine that you 
walking street 
music that you listening to, 
would change tempo, 
according to fast you moving 
so if you moving slowly 
music might be, you know might also 
a relatively low tempo, might 
a little bit relaxed, little chill 
if you started running 
would tempo pick up, 
you could also change 
energy in music 
would become much energetic, 
much exciting, much thrilling 
so kind stuff you 
ive seen 
earlier apps well 
yeah 
youve obviously done 
quite large scale apps 
that movie tieins 
yeah, thats right 
one first movie tiein apps that 
we called inception, that 
came a end , along with, 
alongside dvd release film 
inception app worked 
extremely well film, 
film is dreams, 
going to dreams within dreams, 
losing a bit in this, 
in dream environment 
certainly one thing that kinds of, 
kinds music that we 
making time, one thing that lent 
well to, a kind dream, 
psychedelic experience 
worked incredibly well 
people in fact really worried 
that if went to sleep 
this thing 
would never wake 
laugh a real customer complaint 
cough 
yeah, certainly 
since we also done 
movie tieins 
dark knight, there even 
new ones coming pipe line 
that is really cool 
so, so thats main stream that 
interactive reactive music there 
yeah, absolutely 
i think something that will 
become even mainstream in, 
in coming years 
philosophy behind rjdj 
is always that 
last year many decades 
music frozen 
we record music, 
we import to medium, whether 
vinyl, cassette, cd days mp 
youve made recording 
that music, done, 
stays like that forever 
every time that you go back 
listen to that piece music, 
exactly 
technology that we 
in palm hands today, 
we so much 
we allow the, 
musician to give fans 
different variations that 
in mind a piece music, 
we allow fans to explore 
different variations 
right 
instance, 
you imagine video games, 
you go you driving 
plot, you driving happens 
you go explore scene 
video game developers created 
we would like to able to give 
opportunity to musicians 
yeah right 
interesting well 
landscapes changing isnt 
a little bit a development 
particularly in terms audio 
web audio api, so 
using part this coursera program 
instead native coding 
audio the, devices 
you think it, 
you think a good step forward 
oh, 
absolutely i love web audio api 
in past weve done 
everything natively course 
we needed performance 
now, that web audio apis coming 
along standardized to 
degree, certainly seen support 
across desk top browsers 
also mobile browsers 
mmhm 
gives gives 
developer opportunity to 
develop audio experience 
truly able to deliver to many 
platforms without to a lot 
work in order to adapt code 
whether experienced to 
one particular platform 
yeah, so i think weve found 
really useful delivering this program 
mmhm 
also i think weve gotta kind 
theres an instinct 
whats going to happen 
that web audio api is there 
you sense this huge 
amount music interactive music, 
reactive music 
music instruments web 
this huge kind number 
applications to spill 
oh sure 
almost if inaudible yeah 
i would say right people 
really experimenting, 
theyre trying to figure whats 
possible like this course 
mm 
people become 
comfortable technology, 
understand, 
limits 
start pushing 
limits, im extremely excited 
yeah 
extremely excited 
well, thats great 
i really appreciate you coming 
talking to us 
i know that youre busy, 
you got to shoot 
talk to music types 
yeah 
we going to go 
web audio api kind 
based synthesis stuff now, and, 
yeah, i kind of, 
going to give you 
a quick burst sounds like 
kind of, you know 
yeah, this is one 
so this is app that 
going to talking 
music 
so you get picture 
music
