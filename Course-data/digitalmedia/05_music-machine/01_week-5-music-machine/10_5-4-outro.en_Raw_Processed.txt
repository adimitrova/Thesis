so weve given you something great 
here 
you, you really need to, to, to work 
this, and, make something 
individual to put sounds in 
there 
to, to see if you experiment with, 
length sequences 
yeah 
you stick waveforms in 
you change sequence lengths 
you could a proper gui rather 
that bleak affair 
i quite like bleak 
postnuclear tv 
you might, you might try make 
like like a vintage drum machine 
you could get, get an image a vintage 
drum machine you saw in slides 
you could put that behind it, put 
buttons top 
theres kinds stuff you do, 
you know, you really get creative 
this 
remember you use images 
buttons, so thats an easy thing to 
yeah, i quite like filter, 
thing web audio equalizer, 
a really, really nice filter 
i want us to get in

right here 
right here 
oh, there we go 
yeah 
sound 
that filter cut thing, 
envelope 
well, thats neat 
we really, we really dig 
around get that kind 
unkown 
so, thats digital media 
mobile applications 
weve teaching you to 
creative programming 
weve tried to make easy you to 
get started possible, regardless 
background 
give you lots opportunities to 
develop skills creatively 
also technically 
you know, weve created a bunch 
programming, languages libraries 
well, languages such, 
libraries that make easier you to 
things that you want to 
i think thats quite good 
successful 
theyve got a physics engine, theyve got 
a music engine, theyve got, else

if youre interested in following 
this more, you feel 
like you want to if you, well,

unknown 
we run a digital loss computing program 
is a combination arts 
department

program is kicking right you 
apply that less in next 
couple months 
we also a masters program in 
computational arts, a masters in 
fine art computational arts, if

university london international 
programs 
yes 
so, wherever you are, you 
actually take that program 
yeah, this is a good starting 
point plan 
yeah 
yeah, yeah 
thats really 

thank you much still here
