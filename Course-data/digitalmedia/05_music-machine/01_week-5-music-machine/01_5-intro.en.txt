[NOISE]. Hi and welcome to the final week of 
Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Applications. 
This week's a bit special because it's the last week, but also we're going to do 
something that's a bit more fun and for our specialist audience and our 
specialist market. We are going to build a synthesizor and a 
drum machine that works on mobile devices and on desktop devices entirely using 
browser technology. So yeah, we've been working quite hard to 
get this together for you. Although, it's very, very simple for you 
to interact with and you should be able to, from this example that we're going to 
show you, go ahead and build a lot of your own music synthesizers and 
sequences. And I think this is a nice way to end 
because it shows you how we can use a GUI and quite complex audio ideas, sound 
ideas, and music ideas to put something together that's very usable for people 
who don't necessarily have a lot of musical skills. 
But then allows the to produce something which does sound musical... 
Although, having said that, it's me that's playing it so, you know, my goal 
whenever I try and write music software is to make something which I can play 
when I'm really drunk. so that's been my vision for this week. 
we've got Marco, who's going to be telling you a little bit of how to set up 
sliders. Particularly, sliders so you can change 
the parameters for the synthesizer. And then we've got Matt. 
And Matt is going to tell you that some of the specifics about creating a 
sequencer using processing. Now, it's gotta be said, processing is 
not the best language to be doing sound in of any kind. 
So the fact that this works at all is you know, is I think very useful for a lot of 
people that are interested in making music. 
So, we'll take you through step by step as always, and this week we're going to 
start with Matt, and he's going to talk you through basic, building a basic drum 
machine. So Matt, how does it work?
