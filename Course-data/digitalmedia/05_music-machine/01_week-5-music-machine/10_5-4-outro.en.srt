1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:04,955
[BLANK AUDIO]. 

2
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:22,574
[SOUND]. 

3
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:26,640
I have to say that sounds really good. 
I'm the one here who isn't a musician, so 

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,544
I can't say much about it, but Matt what 
is it about that synth that makes it 

5
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,565
sound well? 
 >> He doesn't care. 

6
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:35,638
 >> He doesn't care. 
 >> He doesn't care, he's playing. 

7
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,282
I'm not going to, you know, I'm not 
going to say anything. 

8
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:38,926
 >> I just love this mate, I think it's 
amazing. 

9
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,248
 >> Cool. 
 >> so we've given you something great 

10
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:43,481
here. 
You, you really need to, to, to work on 

11
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:46,592
this, and, and make it into something 
individual to put your own sounds in 

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,532
there. 
To, to see if you can experiment with, 

13
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:52,158
with the length of the sequences. 
 >> Yeah. 

14
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,611
And you can stick your own waveforms in. 
You can change all the sequence lengths. 

15
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,509
You could do a proper GUI rather than 
that bleak affair. 

16
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,110
I quite like it bleak. 
It's all post-nuclear TV 303. 

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,118
 >> You might, you might try and make it 
like like a vintage drum machine. 

18
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,998
You could get, get an image of a vintage 
drum machine as you saw in my slides and 

19
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:12,301
you could put that behind it, put the 
buttons on top. 

20
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,471
There's all kinds of stuff you can do, 
you know, you can really get creative 

21
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,834
with this. 
 >> Remember you can use images for the 

22
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:20,828
buttons, so that's an easy thing to do. 
 >> Yeah, the I quite like the filter, 

23
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:25,325
the thing about the web audio equalizer, 
it has a really, really nice filter. 

24
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:27,999
And I want us to get in. 
 >> Okay, come on then. 

25
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,671
So, this is really taking me back. 
I mean it's, you know. 

26
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,149
 >> [LAUGH]. 
It's that kind of where's it gone? 

27
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,976
Where's the sound gone? 
 >> It's right here. 

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,285
It's right here. 
 >> Oh, there we go. 

29
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:40,343
Yeah. 
[SOUND]. 

30
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:45,804
It's just that filter cut off thing, and 
with the envelope. 

31
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,832
Well, that's neat. 
 >> We can really, we can really dig 

32
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,457
around and get into that kind of 
[UNKOWN]. 

33
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:55,249
 >> So, that's it for Digital Media and 
Mobile Applications. 

34
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,047
And we've been teaching you how to do 
creative programming. 

35
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:01,923
We've tried to make it as easy for you to 
get started as possible, regardless of 

36
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:05,831
your background. 
And give you lots of opportunities to 

37
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:09,807
develop your skills both creatively and 
also technically. 

38
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:14,807
You know, we've created a bunch of 
programming, languages and libraries. 

39
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:17,064
Well, not languages as such, just 
libraries that make it easier for you to 

40
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:20,947
do the things that you want to do. 
and I think that's been quite good. 

41
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,379
It's been successful. 
They've got a physics engine, they've got 

42
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,756
a music engine, they've got, what else 
have they got? 

43
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,094
They've got Facebook stuff. 
All this different stuff. 

44
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:31,181
And you can just go away. 
And if you're interested in following 

45
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:34,496
this up and doing some more, but you feel 
like you want to do some if you, well, 

46
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,367
let's say you want to be more creative, 
at [UNKNOWN]. 

47
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:42,147
We run a digital loss computing program 
which is a combination with the arts 

48
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:45,750
department. 
that's [UNKNOWN] art department so that 

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,502
program is kicking off right now and you 
apply for that more or less in the next 

50
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,181
couple of months. 
 >> we also have a Master's program in 

51
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,785
Computational Arts, and a Master's in 
Fine Art and Computational Arts, if 

52
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,407
you're more creative. 
We also have a BSC in Creative Computing 

53
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,861
as well, don't we, Marco? 
 >> Yeah. 

54
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,907
That's running in London, but it's also 
running internationally as part of the 

55
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,775
University of London International 
Programs. 

56
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,681
 >> Yes. 
 >> So, wherever you are, you can 

57
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,364
actually take that program. 
 >> Yeah, and this is a good starting 

58
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,788
off point plan. 
 >> Yeah. 

59
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,574
 >> Yeah, yeah. 
 >> And that's really what it's been 

60
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:16,206
about. 
Thank you very much for still being here 

61
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:20,391
through all of the coding help. 
And but, actually, you know what? 

62
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,979
It's exciting when it works and that's 
what makes it worthwhile. 

63
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,299
 >> Yeah, and this is so much great 
stuff, just combine together all of the 

64
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,739
stuff we have shown you like mix it up, 
figure out what new things you can do 

65
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,432
with all the taught we have given you. 
 >> And then, send it to us, because we 

66
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:32,784
want to see. 
 >> Yeah. 

67
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:33,613
 >> We really want to see what you're 
doing. 

68
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,652
 >> We'd love to see what you're doing. 
And we want to hear some more music. 

69
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,824
Matt, do you got anything. 
 >> Yeah, music. 

70
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,769
[MUSIC]. 

71
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,812
Matt's actually very, very good at synth 
stuff. 

72
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:50,560
I built this for you, it's true. 
 >> I just love this, it's brilliant, 

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,961
brilliant work. 
Have fun. 

74
00:03:52,961 --> 00:04:03,164
[MUSIC].
