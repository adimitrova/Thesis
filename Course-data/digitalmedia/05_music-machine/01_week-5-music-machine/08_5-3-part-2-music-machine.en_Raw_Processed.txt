sound 
okay 
so you know, we talking to 
martin, telling us a bit 
rjdj 
weve heard marko 
markos telling us to use 
sliders 
weve also done stuff last week 
sliders building stuff 
and, you know, matts this 
stuff you about, playing back sounds 
in rhythm to a sequence 
so, im is im going to show 
you an application that we developed, i 
briefly touched upon martin 
im going to im going to set 
running you 
i want you to kind pay 
attention to little things i 
im them, im going to briefly 
explain are, im going to 
go whole application in 
detail 
explain works 
going to discuss 
marco matt end so 
that we make sure weve got 
everything covered 
this is like a fully fledged music 
application 
sonically quite advanced 
bare minimum user 
interface, interaction, 
so you could use quite a lot 
techniques that in this to make 
thing 
lets see sounds like 
see we, we 
music okay, here we 
so you hear weve got a drum machine 
lets turn two synths down, so 
we hear these, drums 
here 
weve got a bass drum, we got a snare 
drum you see, im pointing a 
snare drum hit 
music that one that one 
theres a blue line that tracks 
across telling us in a drum beat we 

second line in drum, in drum 
machine is this 
you hear that 
thats 
inaudible 
clap 
so claps going in between 
beats in between base snares 
you got a classic techno feel 
matt saying sounds 
using come straight 
standard kind drum machine 
thereof music so, else 

well, weve got two synthesizers 
we play inaudible 
synthesizers individually, we 
vary a whole range parameters 

theyre fully fledged synthesizers 
we write waveforms 
if youre interested in synthesis you 
know a little i think youll 
find this one interesting 
if you dont, still really 
usable i need you to get head 
around 
we write waveforms, we add a 
filter, we change quality 
filter 
lets a listen to 
filters, im want to turn one 
music so heres one synths 
im going to change filter 
music music ive also got this 
resonance 
this filter 
we could also change release 
attack 
so giving an envelope 
creates that kind acid techno 
feel 
if i change attack actually 
something like this 
music makes quieter 
we transpose channels 
so ill change key entire 
sequence 

if i want music 
you go back to you were, 
less 
also, i add delay 
music ive got a second one here 
well 
now, beat that im altering 
moment is actual music inaudible 
sequence notes that plays 
now, i select a sequence high 
notes, like this, a sequence low 
notes 
like in example that matt 
showing you inaudible music drum 
machine 
theres steps, so i change two 
notes 
there you go 
ive got fill trap well ill 
this stuff 
music 
thats quite pleasant 
we resonance 
music thats distorting quite a lot 
i dont really mind 
i add delay 
music add a few claps 
music snares 
maybe a cymbal 
music 
you gotta take, 
so thats a basic music machine 
music a common thing that you 
easily sell upstart for, i dont 
know, actually music apps 
lets talk this a minute 
music apps go quite a lot money 
kind apps 
you sell an app like this much 
three quid inaudible 
ios app store 
you probably sell five to six 
pounds 
if youre in america, that would 
dollars 
i imagine that like 
inaudible, is, pounds 
dollars anyway 
cares 
anyway, theyre much expensive 
theyre much specialist theyre 
still theyre still really useful 
i think something like this, i mean 
something really famous, well, theres 
a really famous unknown app is 
built on, based a oldfashioned tv 
r synthesizer a nice inaudible 
drum machine in still sells in 
droves 
people is complain 
unusable is 
so im that worried that is 
knocked quite quickly 
is knocked quite quickly, 
is powerful, you build to 
interesting things 
you could use stuff 
weve done to play loops 
there complexities to this 
i want to show that you know, 
are, so im going to quit this 
temporarily go back to basic 
version i continue that 
see you see in simple 
possible way is that 
so you go this stuff free i 
describing 
ive said every week, you know, you 
go to lessons 
this time in week six 
week six got a bunch small tests 
in 
got a small drum machine, ts 
got this thing called synth test 
so, going to a quick look 
this synth test 
a easier code to, to 
look 
got gooey code in 
doesnt drum machine 
one synthesizer 
yeah 
there you go 
one synths 
music music now, cough so you 
see here same, basically 
allows to set pitch, change 
filter, change resonance 
old old 
lets a look 
so we start we normally start 
declaring a maxim context 
if i make this a little bigger 
so you see 
so this is whats happening audio 
behind it, as, you know martin 
here we talking web audio 
api 
so, behind this is web audio 
maxim js, maxim js file, 
is here got this stuff 
in background 
now, if youre interested in this sort 
stuff, you want to learn 
we built max js 
you always post questions 
forums 
tas will manage 
really important questions we feel 
weve got material we really 
help you we point you towards a 
good answer 
also there lots places 
like musicdspcom sites like 
that help you understand is 
thats gone building this 
you dont really need to if you 
want to get started 
we to a context, maxim 
provides context 
also, weve got an audio file player 
actually, using that here, so 
thats going to matter 
instead using audio file player, 
is weve using 
time, using a synth 
so, maxim a synth ive 
called this synth waveform 
now, thing a synth that makes 
different to an audio file player is 
you write in an array values 
between minus 
that will define texture 
sound youre creating 
now, synthesizers a number 
different wave forms 
theres lot different approaches 
to creating wave forms 
um, cough in one 
examples that weve got in this folder 
theres a really easy way gyrating 
wave forms essentially, youre 
writing numbers between minus 
an array is a particular 
length 
so well talking to that 
in a moment 
so we synth 
called waveform, writing a 
waveform it, is makes 
sound 
weve got a play head 
now, play head, matt 
describing, is, literally thing 
tells us many, many frames 
there 
we use that to work whether we 
trigger a new beat 
okay 
so weve also got, this array called 
notes, is an integer array 
holds midi notes 
if you know music, youll know 
midi is 
if you dont really know music 
music technology, youve probably never 
heard 
called musical instrument digital 
interface 
a specification 
a numbering system that relates to 
musical notes musical information 
so midi notes normally 
represent keys 
keyboard 
theyre bit numbers, means that 
go a range to 
theres independent values, 
lower, number, lower, note 
so, im right bottom end 
piano, you see 
numbers, zero, zero, zero 
, , , whatever 
okay 
so, weve got float variables 
fc, is filter cutoff, resonance, 
attack, release 
variables im using 
to control filter cutoff resonance, 
attack release synth 
this is wave table 
excuse 
this is wave table 
an array float variables 
like i said going to between minus 
one one got four five hundred 
fourteen elements 
reason got elements 
kind complicated 
something called interpolate 
briefly we need to we 
create that way, we create a 
waveform, is we need to make sure that 
that waveform playback various 
different frequencies 
so sound is made lots lots 
different frequencies we measure 
frequencies in repetitions per 
second 
cycles per second, measurement 
value we use that is hertz 
so example, if i take a sound, a 
small snippet sound i repeat 
times a second we actually 
hear a pitched note, 
repeating so fast 
thats we think of, we think 
music 
people think pitched 
notes 
so, in order to able to a, a wav 
form played back 
hertz, oth end 
scale , hertz, is 
highest, frequency that we hear 
in fact, i cant hear , hertz 
i tryin to kid 
you get older, you cant really hear 
there 
i probably hear , hertz 
or, if im a good day, a good 
wind 
so, in order to able to that, to go 
between a low frequency sound a 
high frequency sound, we need to 
interpolate 
to make interpolation work, ie 
to make numbers that we need 
thats interpolation means 
means making numbers that 
arent there 
what, we changed playback 
rate waveform, to make 
numbers, we need spare numbers 
end 
so its, normally you a point 
buffer, called a point buffer 
its, its, thats number 
points that you run to make 
sound 
youve got a couple extra 
points end, using 
interpolation 
so thats reason 
okay, so there setup options 
sorry, theyre setup options, 
they, basically 
declarations 
we declaring objects that we 
need in order to make this program work 
im is im going 
setup function 
im declaring a size 
im creating a, im calling new 
maxim object, that means im setting 
context 
ive gone cough done, done 
thing to wave form objects 
im, im creating new synth 
so synth is got a, a waveform in it, 
is waiting to populated 
something numbers 
also got stuff 
that we need delays, filters that 
kind malarkey 
setting sliders 
this is way marko showed 
you to 
ive got this, is delayed time 
thats dt, dg, is delayed amount 
delayed game 
a, is attack 
r, is released 
f, is filter cut 
q, is filter q, is 
resonance, is makes 
sound, sort acidy 
so, there sliders that we need 
i another multislider, 
im using to enter notes 
so you see here, mark explained 
to you multislider works 
seq is also, thats a sequence 
a, basically takes an array 
takes array notes 
it, fills that array whenever 
i interact multislider 
okay 
so i then, im loading a file im 
using 
so actually sound we dont need that 
frame rate is 
frame rate is roughly speed 
tick rate 
like matt explained 
instead running 
ticks, using to trigger drum 
sounds, although we that in 
advanced example 
in this example, going to use 
to select a note note array 
use to set a frequency 
waveform generator 
okay 
so, we that, still 
in setup 
you see section here that im 
highlighting 
this is generating a waveform 
so we know that buffer is points 
long so 
we want to fill array, is 
elements long a bunch numbers 
between minus one one 
cough now, im going a sorptive 
wave here so, i actually want 
waveform to points, ive 
explained, a couple extra 
points good measure 
so, im is im taking 
value, i, im dividing to 
make a value between zero one 
im subtracting to make a 
value between negative 
actually happens i that 
is i, i make a ramp, you know, 
if, if you imagine thats array, 
ramp goes like this, so kind 
an inverted sawtooth wave 
repeats, drops down, goes 
back to beginning, goes again, 
this produces a nice harmonic spectrum 
that we filter 
a simple waveform, 
creates harmonics and, 
pretty much creates every harmonic that 
we need 
then, we filter harmonics out, 
add resonance that acid 
sound 
values, actual amplitude is 
minus, naught to 
thats absolutely fine 
its, absolutely fine 
we could double it, wed get 
distortion 
you hear that you know id 
to work balancing this so 
to keep sound within a 
reaonable range 
so i make the, waveform 
i add to synth is called 
ironically enough confusingly enough 
waveform 
so i set wave table size i could 
set to amount i like that weve 
already discussed going to 
i load wave table 
in 
wave form load wave table wave table 
wave form dot play 
so, that means ive initialized 
synthesiser 
ive loaded a wave form 
i change that time, way 
that i like 
so you could different wave 
forms 
you could really long wave forms 
you could take a picture face, 
analyze pixels, use that 
a waveform entirely to you 
an array numbers 
so you know creative im 
pressing play that really means is 

so ready to rock 
in door method 
stuff that marco explained 
we cough setting sliders 
we get slider information in 
draw method 
so, if f get, basically if we get 
something frequency slider, we 
set filter that belongs to wave 
form object 
if we get delay time, we set 
delay time 
yes unless im munging im dividing 
fifty to get a decent range 
thing to delay gang get to 
huge get 
a get r get 
lots good gets 
we in draw method thats 
a good place to set display 
so we display everything 
we business end, is 
ticking array, 
notes in, using that to set 
frequencies 
so, playhead , every time we enter 
draw loop, we iterate playhead 
so tick rate is different to rate 
actual playback 
tick rate is quite fast, 
frames a second 
we could 
quite fast 
a tick rates normally much much 
higher rate rhythm 
so ive done is ive said, 
okay 
well, every four ticks 
well say thats a semi quaver, is 
a 
small chunk a beat, a quarter 
a beat, so f play modular four equals 
equals zero way matthews 
already showed you 
wave formramp, we ramped a cough 
knot is going to volume 
given attack time 
yet 
that is means that, if 
attack times long, itll a slow 
ramp 
if attack time, attack time is 
fast, will a short ramp 
then, following a ramp, we set 
frequency 
wave form set frequency 
now, using this thing, mf 
this is takes midi notes 
turns frequency information 
this is looking an array, 
is a maxim j here 
so saying okay, if i get a, a number 
zero, thats going to a midi note 
zero 
if i get a number one, a midi note 
one, thats going to a frequency 
, well never hear 
i generated this an algorithm 
i pasted in, saves 
you to worry 
okay 
we access notes 
we get play head modulo 
sorry, play head divided , modulo 
thats basically saying, okay 
weve ticks, thats fine 
this is note we actually want 
adding , is a 
constant, is just, so if 
zero, would actually 
so finally we is next ti, 
tick we release 
so immediately we release we 
retriever 
so if player head module inaudible 
equals equals one we trigger release, 

there better ways this, 
using processing 
okay, so you see, weve triggered 
sound, weve set note this 
particular tick weve released 
following notes, following 
tig 
so next thing to is to sort 
interaction 
mouse pressed, we is, we 
get user interface stuff, 
that handles mouse pressed gui 
dt mouse pressed, dt mouse pressed, blah 
thing in mouse drags so thats 
useful mouse devices 
in mouse release we we check one 
thing 
we check to see if notes changed 
in array that holds notes 
if have, we populate 
sequence sorry, we populate notes 
array new sequence thats in 
sequence similty slider 
thats this does, so notes i, 
is current note to , 
so theres different steps, we flaw 
this value basically 
so we get sequencing value 
theres a bit unknown to 
make sure that right value 
we stick in there, make, we basically 
convert slider value to a 
mini value 
we could used map function to 
that, would easier to 
read 
instead using map, im 
standard mathematical operators 
right 
that actually is that, is that first 
test 
so lets go back a look 
music 
yeah, thats nice 
heres delay time 
music 
sound i wanted to talk briefly 
filter filter is 
quite is, i dont know, nice to 
think filter actually 

ive already explained that we a 
wave form goes a certain rate 
give us lots harmonics 
we use filter to block 
that process occurs is kind 
interesting 
basically filter sound is 
it, lets everything sound 
lets get a single note sound 
lets everything wide 
open 
music we drop it, 
actually music is this preventing 
weight form moving quickly 
filter basically is averaging 
smoothing weight formg 
weight form remember is like that 
going really really fast 
lets say going a thousand times a 
second 
producing harmonics 

two thousand, three thousand, four 
thousand, five thousand, six thousand, 
seven thousand, eight thousand, et 
cetera, times per second, an 
altitude dropoff 
thats making a bright sound 
thats making that buzz, that nice, 
buzzing sound that we, we like 
well, im assuming you like that 
if you dont like that music 
that tough, cuz thats sound 
makes 
thing is that we repeat 
again, were, 
actually, we get to end 
route, we drop 
thats actually quite a fast move 
thats creates 
harmonics 
if we smooth that, prevents 
harmonics generated, 
smoothes filters that sound, so 
actually is averaging 
signal goes up, kind 
thats fine a slow 
increase, we get that 
sudden drop, we smooth in way 
we might blur an image 
thats less we turn high 
frequencies 
so, really simple if youre 
interested in that process 
theres a number filters that come 
bundled course air package that 
weve put together you 
run nicely android well, 
so you want to a look those, 
theyre in android package 
theres 
you actually see algorithms 
if youre interested, you a look 

alright, so thats synthesiser 
works 
now, finally, i want to is go 
back to our, 
a complex example that combines 
bits together talk 
that tinal thing wor, works 
a few little things that make a 
bit useable 
so im going to go back to music 
machine example is here im 
going to run whats going to 
happen is 
music started straight away 
cough distorting beautifully 
really bad 
theres little i to 
music make music 
lets bass drums 
i like a bit bass drum, you 
hear bass drum 
you about, let knock this one 

okay, thats good 
quite hard to use that 
you could a nicer keyboard setting 
something like that 
music so lets a look 
weve done to put main application 
together 
so, weve got two synthesizers 
theres a clever way to this 
theres a stupid way this 
to make life easier, ive done 
stupid way 
instead creating an object a class 
is a synth although ive already 
done that behind scenes anyway 
instead that, so 
clear you see done, ive 
duplicated codes 
there actually two sets 
a brighter, cleverer, engineering 
savvy method is to make another class 
that encapsulates sliders 
to create one 
objects to say you want 
to put it, so thats something we 
a look 
theres a good example in 
current examples that weve given you, 
there good examples classes, 
you a look that 
i didnt want to that find 
that no, that you didnt really 
understand that whole process 
so ive gone ive 
duplicated that code 
so basic stuff is i thought well i want 
to look slightly better 
currently looks so ive created a brushed 
metal background 
ive positioned sliders 
screen ive created this brushed 
metal background you see that this is 
a good tip 
if you avoid havong to draw 
nonanimated information 
via algorithmic methods, ie 
if you avoid to apply 
interface graphics, avoid 
make a photoshop image that 
interface 
so ive got a slightly embossed area here 
here panels that 
hold information if i spent 
time that i make look really 
nice ive fake knobs switches 
that i copied pasted internet 
i could photograph something 
set connection put 
instead 
i guess im trying to say is you 
an awful lot preparing 
images in photoshop like we last 
week instaspan overlay 
sort thing 
put effort in there if 
going to animate 
put effort in in photoshop, make 
look sweet, draw 
i must admit ive really put 
effort in here, theres a back, 
theres a basic starting point 
you see panels theyre 
sort lined 
another thing you is you put 
interactive graphic elements onto 
screen so that you that 
problematically you screenshot 
right size move that 
photoshop application you 
draw top 
i guess im saying is 
work in photoshop is youre going to 
to animate make look nice 
there 
we exactly thing 
angry droids well we a bit 
support work there 
so thats basic idea, you get 
away a lot there 
also nice to add custom graphics to 
sliders, you that 
so, weve done that 
weve loaded in here 
weve done thing, exact 
thing that matt drum 
track 
we created four boolean arrays 
track, , , , 
four drum sounds that 
in drum machine, is a 
kick, a snare, a handclap, a cymbal 
ideally, id a hi hat 
there is a hi hat knocking around in one 
the, folders coursera pack that 
youve got 
you see here, exactly i said, 
i duplicated everything 
so theres floats that youve already 
seen 
except weve added another function, 
filter attack, is gives 
that sort tb baseline sound 
laugh allegedly 
weve got, transpose 
functions well, allows us to 
move around 
weve got a second wave table 
second object 
you see weve got two syns waveform 
waveform two 
basically 
everything that a two is 
second waveform 
we create a bunch secondary slide 
sliders multisliders to hold 
separate information we load in 
samples 
we set a sliders, so we 
twice many sliders 
slightly different numbers 
in to re, to represent fact that 
theyre going to drawn somewhere else 
i said, you would draw them, 
screen shot it, import photoshop, 
background, load 
background 
so we load background i 
load background 
bottom this 
thats wavetable, exactly 
way i described in first example 
okay background is loaded, there 
is, brushed metal, thats brushed 
metal background 
here, i is i set 
drum tracks in way that matts 
already explained 
i create boolean arrays, 
theyre either true false 
i set to false, so theyre 

okay, we get information 
in exactly way, we 

we use playhead 
information to get frequency content 
synthesizers 
we use another variable, current 
b, so we could use playhead if 
using current b 
doesnt really matter, 
to find whether if true 
basically, we is cough we 
play that drum sound back 
mass press stuff is exactly same, 
if you click there sets and, youve 
set to play 
in mouse press mouse drags 
that, exactly 
two examples youve seen 
basic synth example, drum 
example 
thats you end this 
music 
music
