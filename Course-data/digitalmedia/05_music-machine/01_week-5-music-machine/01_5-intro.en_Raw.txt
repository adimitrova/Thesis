[noise]. 
hi and welcome to the final week of 
creative programming for digital media 
and mobile applications. 
this week's a bit special because it's 
the last week, but also we're going to do 
something that's a bit more fun and for 
our specialist audience and our 
specialist market. 
we are going to build a synthesizor and a 
drum machine that works on mobile devices 
and on desktop devices entirely using 
browser technology. 
so yeah, we've been working quite hard to 
get this together for you. 
although, it's very, very simple for you 
to interact with and you should be able 
to, from this example that we're going to 
show you, go ahead and build a lot of 
your own music synthesizers and 
sequences. 
and i think this is a nice way to end 
because it shows you how we can use a gui 
and quite complex audio ideas, sound 
ideas, and music ideas to put something 
together that's very usable for people 
who don't necessarily have a lot of 
musical skills. 
but then allows the to produce something 
which does sound musical... 
although, having said that, it's me 
that's playing it so, you know, my goal 
whenever i try and write music software 
is to make something which i can play 
when i'm really drunk. 
so that's been my vision for this week. 
we've got marco, who's going to be 
telling you a little bit of how to set up 
sliders. 
particularly, sliders so you can change 
the parameters for the synthesizer. 
and then we've got matt. 
and matt is going to tell you that some 
of the specifics about creating a 
sequencer using processing. 
now, it's gotta be said, processing is 
not the best language to be doing sound 
in of any kind. 
so the fact that this works at all is you 
know, is i think very useful for a lot of 
people that are interested in making 
music. 
so, we'll take you through step by step 
as always, and this week we're going to 
start with matt, and he's going to talk 
you through basic, building a basic drum 
machine. 
so matt, how does it work?
