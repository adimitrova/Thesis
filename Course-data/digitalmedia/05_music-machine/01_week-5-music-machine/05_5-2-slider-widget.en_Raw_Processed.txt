so last week we introduced user 
interfaces, i introduced you to 
user interface library that i 
this week going to continue 
using that to make music machine, 
going to introduce one 
feature that library, is 
sliders 
so, a slider looks like this 
a horizontal bar that you click 
moves across screen, 
usual we make that effect 
whats going things in program, 
in this case you set screen cover 
so, lets see that works 
a slider works pretty similar, in a 
pretty similar way to buttons that we 
saw last week 
you create a slider, give a name 
this is a new thing, you need to set 
minimum maximum values 
slider 
minimum maximum values 
that you get a slider 
so, slider will a certain size, 
user interface element 
will go the, left that 
slider to right that slider 
left that slider will give you a 
minimum value, in this case zero 
right that slider will give 
you a maximum value 
values using to 
control color, go between zero 
if you to control something else, 
like audio volume, you would need another 
range of, values 
this is quite similar to map examples 
we used earlier 
we initial value 
slider 
so you might want to start , 
sometimes you want to start another 
value 
here im starting 
bits pretty much 
button 
you give a position, x, y, a size, 
width, height 
this last this last parameter is 
orientation slider, whether a 
horizontal slider a vertical slider 
you see we change that 
sliders pretty much work as, in 
way buttons 
you need to draw in display 
method, in draw method, you need 
to do, you need to check whether 
clicked in mouse 
released method, ill show you 
one thing you need to is get 
value slider 
so you need to know what, value 
that slider is, we use 
function get, sliderget 
well return you a floating point value, 
a number, between minimum value 
maximum value, you use 
that simple code 
so lets see an example that 
so this is program i ran earlier 
weve got a slider variable, we 
button variables 
this is we creating slider 
you remember minimum 
maximum values, thats 
initial value, we display in the, in 
draw method, we call, slide 
mouse released 
in mouse released method, this is 
we actually make interact 
rest program 
we get value slider use 
that input to backgrounds color, 
lets remind that 

so getting value slider, 
a value between 
thats we set to, and, thats 
changing background color 
we change initial value 
we change minimum value so that 
never going to get dark, even 
right bottom still quite 
grey, maximum value similarly so to 
stop whiting 
thing we might want to 
change is orientation it, so 
currently drawn horizontally across 
screen, we draw vertically 
well 
but, i need to remember to change 
values 
going to a short, fat 
vertical slider, if i draw size 
the, horizontal slider 
so if im drawing a vertical slider, i 
need to make thin long, 
opposed to wide short 
so im swapping width height 
there we vertical slider 
a button fine to 
respond to clicks, actually a 
slider quite satisfying to drag 
around you cant 
input code is now, 
is simple 
we create a mouse drag method 
call smousedrag 
we drag smoothly 
smoothly change values so you 
call mouse press, mouse 
release, mouse drags user 
interface will equivalents 
lets show you one last example 
to use multiple sliders together 
last week you saw to create radio 
buttons is a combination 
different buttons, a series buttons 
you something similar 
sliders you a set different 
sliders that, that you interact with, 
looks something like this 
so i set color 
channels background individually 
so i make less red 
again, works in a quite similar 
way 
we multi slider available 
we create multi sliders 
like radio buttons, we to 
give number sliders you want 
in this case, taking 
length this string this array 
names, like radio buttons 
we set names 
we display we do, 
mouse release to capture events, in 
here getting theres longer 
single gets 
we get value individual 
slider, we pass in number that 
slider, so get zero 
well get first slider, get one, 
second get two, well get third 
so, thats works 
so, get zero well get value this 
slider i click 
music
