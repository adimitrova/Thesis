so last week we introduced user 
interfaces, and i introduced you to the 
user interface library that i have. 
now this week we're going to continue 
using that to make music machine, but 
we're going to introduce one other 
feature of that library, which is 
sliders. 
so, a slider looks like this. 
it's a horizontal bar that you can click 
on and it moves across the screen, and as 
usual we can make that effect. 
what's going out things in the program, 
in this case you set the screen cover. 
so, let's just see how that works. 
now a slider works pretty similar, in a 
pretty similar way to the buttons that we 
saw last week. 
you can create a slider, give it a name. 
and this is a new thing, you need to set 
the minimum or maximum values of the 
slider. 
those are the minimum and maximum values 
that you can get out of a slider. 
so, the slider will have a certain size, 
just as any other user interface element. 
and it will go from the, the left of that 
slider to the right of that slider. 
and left of that slider will give you a 
minimum value, in this case zero. 
and the right of that slider will give 
you a maximum value. 
these are the values we're using to 
control color, which go between zero and 
if you were to control something else, 
like audio volume, you would need another 
range of, of values. 
this is quite similar to the map examples 
we used earlier. 
and we have the initial value of the 
slider. 
so you might want to start it at 0, but 
sometimes you want to start it at another 
value. 
here i'm starting it at 20. 
these other bits are pretty much the same 
as the button. 
you give it a position, x, y, and a size, 
width, and height. 
and this last this last parameter is the 
orientation of the slider, whether it's a 
horizontal slider or a vertical slider. 
you can see how we can change that. 
sliders pretty much work as, in the same 
way as buttons. 
you need to draw them in the display 
method, in the draw method, and you need 
to do, you need to check whether they 
have been clicked on in the mouse 
released method, but i'll show you the 
one other thing you need to do is get the 
value of the slider. 
so you need to know what, what the value 
of that slider is, and we can use the 
function get, the slider.get. 
we'll return you a floating point value, 
a number, between the minimum value and 
the maximum value, and then you can use 
that simple code. 
so let's see an example of doing that. 
so this is the program i ran earlier. 
we've got a slider variable, just as we 
had button variables. 
this is where we creating the slider. 
can you remember these are the minimum 
and maximum values, and that's the 
initial value, we display it in the, in 
the draw method, and we call, slide it up 
mouse released. 
in the mouse released method, and this is 
where we actually make it interact with 
the rest of our program. 
we get the value of the slider and use 
that as input to our background's color, 
and let's just remind ourselves what that 
does. 
so we're getting the value of the slider, 
it's a value between 0 and 255 because 
that's what we set it to, and, and that's 
changing the background color. 
we can change your initial value. 
we can change our minimum value so that 
it's never going to get too dark, even 
right at the bottom it's still quite 
grey, our maximum value similarly so to 
stop it whiting out as it does. 
and the other thing we might want to 
change is the orientation of it, so 
currently it's drawn horizontally across 
the screen, but we can draw it vertically 
as well. 
but, i need to remember to change these 
values because. 
it's going to be a very short, fat 
vertical slider, if i draw the same size 
as the, the horizontal slider. 
so if i'm drawing a vertical slider, i 
need to make it's it's thin but long, as 
opposed to wide but short. 
so i'm swapping the width and height and 
there we have our vertical slider. 
now with a button it's fine just to 
respond to clicks, but actually with a 
slider it's quite satisfying to drag 
around and you can't do it. 
input the code as it is now, but doing it 
is very simple. 
we just create a mouse drag method and 
call s.mousedrag. 
and then we can drag very smoothly and 
smoothly change all the values so for you 
can just call any of mouse press, mouse 
release, mouse drags and our user 
interface for each will have equivalents. 
now let's show you one last example of 
how to use multiple sliders together. 
last week you saw how to create radio 
buttons which is a combination of 
different buttons, a series of buttons. 
you can do something very similar with 
sliders where you have a set of different 
sliders that, that you can interact with, 
and it looks something like this. 
so i can now set each of the color 
channels with my background individually 
so i can make it less red. 
and again, it works in a quite similar 
way. 
we have multi slider available. 
we create the multi sliders. 
just like with radio buttons, we have to 
give it the number of sliders you want. 
in this case, we're taking it from the 
length of this string of this array of 
names, and again just like radio buttons 
we can set the names. 
and then we display it and then we do, 
mouse release to capture events, and in 
here we're getting there's no longer 
single gets. 
we can get the value of each individual 
slider, and we pass in the number of that 
slider, so it's get zero. 
we'll get the first slider, get one, 
second get two, we'll get third. 
so, that's how it works. 
so, get zero we'll get the value of this 
slider as i click on it 
[music].
