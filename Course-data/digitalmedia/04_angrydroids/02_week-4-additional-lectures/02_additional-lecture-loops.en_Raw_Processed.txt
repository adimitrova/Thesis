welcome to last additional video, 
is things many, 
many times 
this is something called a loop 
we get to loops, lets talk 
we want to things many, many times 
simplest reason is that we might want to 
draw lots things that similar 
a bunch concentric circles, 
a set lines forming a grid, 
examples im going to use 
also, things get much, 
much complex that 
i mean, you might a game 
lots enemies you want to draw 
in case this weeks example, 
creating complex shapes made 
many similar simple shapes 
and, in a sense, a grid concentric 
circles is a good starting point 
here, this is a sketch that gives us, 
draws a bunch lines across screen 
work 
well, every time we call a draw 
calling line command 
using a variable here is 
changing every frame, so if you watch, 
lets draw gets called every 
time a draw gets called, 
another online gets to 
ill actually set frameworks, so 
this command sets often 
draw is called essentially 
typed in ten times a second, 
slow a little bit so 
that you see 
drawing gradually 
thats kind we want to 
we want to draw one line another, 
another, another 
well see that works 
so this is code i showed to you 
i will go quite 
a lot detail works 
first we create set a variable 
position line starting zero 
weve seen variables last week 
we know work 
a number 
value is zero 
we use current values o to 
draw a line, we start zero 
so drawing a line zero, 
next one is always zero, 
zero, height 
so we make use variable 
here inside blank 
reason using pos twice is 
because, we want start x position 
end x position line to zero, 
we want a vertical line 
we dont want line to 
horizontal, so 
starting x end x position 
thats important here is that 
using this variable to something, 
in this case draw a line 
really important 
bit is this next one 
changing, 
updating value variable 
so weve drawn line, 
we add to 
so next time we draw a line, 
going to in a different position 
reason that works is 
weve done that, repeats 
repeats draw 
is called many, many times 
called one time another, 
rate thats drawn 
lets go back that, 
really important 
we need to understand this to 
understand whats happening next 
we setup a variable 
that variable is going to 
control drawing 
we use value variable, 
we update value variable so 
that next time we use it, 
different, we repeat 
while repeating, 
exactly thing we did, 
a different value variables so 
effect is going to different 
going that 
times 
okay, one small important point next, 
we get to next 
bit is that k never stops 
going to carry going, 
even though screen 
we kind like, probably doesnt 
make a difference if we dont 
see stuff going screen, 
to mind anyway, 
seems a little bit inelegant to carry 
drawing we longer see stuff 
so we want to stop we 
reach end screen 
this is we 
again, we setup variable, 
we anything we use 
an if statement to check 
value variable 
so we check is position, 
is pos less width 
if less width, 
well to carry drawing, 
we havent reached 
end screen 
if width, we stop so 
if we less width 
we drawing, 
updating repeating 
if weve reached end, 
if width, 
wed stop updating, wed stop drawing 
we finish doing, 
we finish that drawing 
so, small thing vital 
in this particular example, 
actually important 
say knowing to stop, 
in this case we 
an if statement, 
important thing is if we 
go back to beginning 
this statement that 
compares variable to end 
condition, to end condition 
so we know that we end 
position reaches width 
so long position is less 
width, we carry going 
so lets briefly see 
that to check works 
so im putting in an if statement, 
checking value position 
you wont really see if works 
we cant tell difference 
between big widths we if 
say, we want drawn to halfway 
across screen, there stopped 
so, we make stop 
we carry stuff, 
we also stopped 
so we done yet 
no, if we want to 
everything time 
if we run this together, that 
is gradually draws a set lines 
across screen, one 
if we want a set 
lines screen 
we that 
in order to things, many things 
once, we need something called a loop 
if we get to live up, we cut this code 
essentially ideas 
does, sets a variable, 
checks value that variable 
values still okay, 
since we havent reached end 
we use current value available 
we update value, we repeat 
this is whats called a loop 
exactly thing, 
one 
until finishes 
sets a variable, 
checks value variable, 
uses current value variable 
updates repeats 
important thing is, 
repeats inside draw 
so repeating per draw, 
repetitions 
every time you call draw 
so that to you, to viewer, 
looks like done, 
once, you get is a much lines 
important thing is 
this four structure 
lets look that in a lot 
im going to repeat 
we set a variable, 
we check value variable 
instead separate, 
theyre inside brackets 
this command 
a little bit like an if statement 
in an if statement you if brackets 
inside there, you condition 
rather a condition, 
we actually have, 
we things 
this there 
having, setting up, 
comparing updating 

loop repeating us 
so lets look that 
a loop three things 
an initial condition, 
a test that checks variable 
so initial value variable, 
check variable, 
increment, so 
increasing value variable 
here im adding one 
thats very, common 
add one a time 
previous one a little 
unusual in that we making 
weve got a body, 
actually using variable 
that repeats 
initial condition test 
increment inside brackets 
theyre separated semicolons 
a little bit surprising 
times youve 
got a function call, we 
expect to see brackets, 
inside commas 
here semicolons, 
this is you know something 
a bit different a function call 
here theyre semicolons, you 
to know that thats works 
like end 
line a semicolon, 
bit loop a semicolon 
to know that, put in, 
part punctuation grammar that, 
ive said before, 
is important to programming 
if you get that right, 
will inaudible work 
okay, i want to look another 
use loops a useful one 
lets recap, is an array 
an array is like a variable but, 
while a variable one value, 
an array many values 
an array variable is we see here 
posx is a little box that points to 
another whole load boxes in 
memory, 
thought variable 
so pointing to 
a large block memory 
so weve got a single variable, 
like an int variable we create, 
we create it, is you create 
a box in memory, give a name, 
posx, put a value in it, zero 
there goes 
you create an array, a little 
bit, creating a memory box, sure 
give a name, sure 
create an array 
put that away in a box, 
rather, put a reference to that away 
so make that box point to an array 
i wont go detail that 
sampled right 
reportedly weve got 
a whole bunch empty boxes 
we havent put stuff in boxes 
so we need put values in 
array boxes one 
so i put one value in another, 
another, another 
we that kind thing 
we one thing another, 
another 
weve seen, a 
this is we might 
go 
first create a memory box 
give a name 
so creating an array 
create array 
so weve got boxes in memory 
put a pointer, so make that posx 
variable point to that memory 
we need to go 
put a value in array box 
thats a link 
lets look that in detail 
we need to is start 
first element in array 
we said last week first time 
is one, zero 
so we start int i, 
set variable i 
stands position in array 
set to zero 
we need to test to check variable 
we need to make sure is 
is length 
hasnt gone way 
so long i is less 
length array, youre okay 
to less than, less 
equal starts zero, 
value array length 
is entity length 
this is like we saw last week in 
animation, we went to stop 
loop animation 
but, again, this time around 
many times 
rather every frame, 
time 
so going until weve 
reached end array 
go one one, add one 
, if you remember, means add one 
frame 
we put value 
array top 
so kind stepping 
element zero, one, 
two, three to length array, 
cutting value 
in this case a random value 
that inaudible 
sound recap, set up, 
start, start position, 
first element a always 
until last element, always less 
equal to length array 
we get that a reigning length 
thats you get 
length array 
go one one, 
always add one to put something in 
whenever youre dealing arrays, 
really useful to 
this place 
this is a really, really common thing 
youve got an array, 
a loop through, array, 
loop always looks 
always starts zero, goes length 
array one doesnt 
in fact, well putting stuff 
array, you stuff to array 
this is an example you might draw a 
point based positions in array 
weve got two arrays 
array x positions, 
array y position will 
drawing a point 
this assumes that size, 
position y is exactly 
position x 
exactly 
so first element starts zero 
until last element, arraylength 
go one one, plus plus, 
add one, use element i 
you use this to 
draw elements in array, 
to create elements in array, 
to various updates 
i could adding something to 
position array 
i could whatever i want, 
like variable 
except this time, 
ive got lots in an array, 
rather using one line code, 
im using a loop to that one 
line code many, 
many times in one time array 
a very, 
common pattern that whenever 
youre working arrays you use 
very, unusual that last week 
okay, so thats end this 
additional programming lecture 
thats last additional 
programming lecture this course 
so i think ive covered 
programming topics youre going to 
need rest course 
you cant learn to program 
watching a few lectures 
you to go it, i recommend 
you trying exercises, 
looking examples weve shown 
you in rest course 
go look documentation, 
try to write programs 
thats way to learn 
theres a kind myth thats, 
to a programmer youve got to 
special aptitude 
people it, people cant 
a load research 
people able to succeed 
programming in university 
that properly, didnt 
thing that made a difference is 
much time people spent programming 
youve really got to it, 
best way to is find 
something youre passionate 
i think anyone in this course creative 
people, something creative 
code, use that to motivate 
to go 
if you spend loads time programming 
practicing practicing 
practicing, you will 
best way to practice is to 
something that youre really into, 
youre really passionate 
something creative, something interesting 
i hope we provided in 
course a bunch examples, 
a bunch exercises 
will make you able to that 
okay, thank you much, 
enjoy rest course 
good luck learning to program
