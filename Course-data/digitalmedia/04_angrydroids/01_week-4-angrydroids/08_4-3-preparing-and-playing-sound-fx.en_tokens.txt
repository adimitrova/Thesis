hello
!
today
in
this
lesson
,
i
'm
going
to
show
you
how
to
create
some
simple
sound
effects
for
,
for
a
collision-based
game
that
we
're
going
to
develop
later
in
the
lessons
this
week
.
and
i
'm
then
going
to
show
you
how
to
import
those
into
your
,
your
project
quickly
which
,
which
is
revision
,
you
've
already
seen
how
to
do
that
,
but
will
just
do
it
do
the
workflow
again
,
just
to
show
you
that
.
i
now
want
you
to
get
really
creative
with
these
sound
effects
.
you
know
collisions
are
great
fun
to
make
.
i
am
just
going
to
demonstrate
some
quick
examples
of
how
to
do
that
but
i
want
you
to
go
for
make
your
own
sounds
and
once
we
got
those
collision
sound
effects
into
the
application
,
what
we
going
to
do
is
figure
out
how
to
trigger
them
.
but
not
just
play
them
as
they
are
,
we
want
to
play
them
with
a
bit
more
a
bit
of
dynamic
range
on
them
.
so
what
we
'll
do
is
,
is
parameterize
the
playback
,
so
that
depending
on
the
number
that
comes
in
they
might
be
played
back
in
a
different
way
.
so
let
's
make
some
sound
effects
.
so
i
've
already
loaded
up
audacity
which
is
a
simple
open-source
.
audio
editor
and
i
'm
just
going
to
record
straight
into
this
,
and
my
laptop
mic
.
of
course
you
could
record
with
much
higher
quality
microphones
if
you
like
,
and
you
'll
get
a
better
sound
,
but
this
will
do
just
for
demonstration
purposes
.
so
,
i
hit
record
,
and
then
i
'm
going
to
make
my
sound
effects
.
[
music
]
okay
so
i
've
now
recorded
a
few
sound
effects
lets
just
listen
to
those
they
're
not
quite
healthy
on
the
wave
form
display
.
[
sound
]
okay
there
fine
.
i
quite
like
that
.
that
's
a
good
one
.
that
's
a
quite
nice
one
.
and
.
[
sound
]
there
's
one
.
so
i
'm
going
to
take
these
uh
,
[
sound
]
these
three
sounds
and
use
these
.
okay
,
so
,
first
of
all
,
i
'll
do
,
i
'll
convert
to
mono
.
so
,
it
's
track
,
stereo
track
to
mono
.
okay
and
then
i
will
trim
them
down
.
so
,
it
's
good
if
you
want
to
,
if
you
want
to
,
cause
they
're
sound
effects
,
you
want
them
to
trigger
very
accurately
.
so
,
it
's
best
if
you
trim
them
right
down
.
okay
,
so
,
let
's
get
the
whole
thing
.
that
'll
do
.
copy
that
,
paste
it
into
a
new
one
,
then
export
and
i
'm
going
to
put
it
into
,
i
'm
going
to
create
a
folder
sound
effects
.
and
this
one
's
going
to
be
ping
one
dot
wav
.
okay
.
[
sound
]
close
that
.
then
i
've
got
the
next
ping
.
zoom
in
.
make
sure
we
've
got
a
nice
trim
on
it
so
that
it
's
right
up
against
the
start
the
sound
.
and
you
can
even
duck
into
the
sound
a
bit
because
they
're
sound
effects
,
they
're
a
little
bit
of
a
click
.
it
's
not
too
much
of
a
problem
.
so
,
edit
,
i
can
actually
export
directly
from
my
selection
.
ping2.wav
.
[
sound
]
then
i
'm
going
to
get
[
inaudible
]
.
what
have
i
got
here
?
i
'm
just
going
to
use
this
rumble
sound
here
[
noise
]
.
okay
and
export
that
file
,
export
selection
and
rumble
.
do
n't
laugh
.
okay
.
get
rid
of
that
.
now
i
'm
going
to
import
these
into
my
sketch
.
so
my
s-
,
i
need
to
find
the
data
folder
for
my
sketch
and
it
's
called
android
sound
effects
.
there
's
the
data
folder
.
i
've
put
all
these
into
this
folder
called
fx
,
so
i
'll
copy
those
.
paste
them
into
there
.
so
i
've
got
ping1
,
ping2
and
rumble
.
you
m-
,
yeah
,
remember
that
all
the
files
that
you
put
in
the
data
folder
will
be
included
in
your
sketch
.
so
you
might
want
to
just
trim
it
down
to
just
the
ones
that
you
need
.
so
let
's
just
get
rid
of
the
ones
we
do
n't
need
.
alright
so
we
just
got
ping1
,
ping2
and
rumble
.
so
we
've
got
all
our
files
they
're
all
ready
to
go
just
need
to
import
,
need
to
load
them
up
so
i
'm
going
to
have
three
players
.
play
1
,
you
might
because
they
're
sound
effects
you
might
want
to
call
them
call
the
players
something
more
sensible
like
,
that
relates
to
the
sound
they
might
make
.
so
i
've
got
ping
one
ping
two
and
rumble
,
okay
?
that
,
that
will
make
it
easier
to
read
the
codes
,
know
which
one
you
're
triggering
.
okay
?
now
,
so
then
i
load
them
in
.
ping
one
.
ping
2
,
then
rumble
.
i
would
n't
[
unknown
]
here
these
sounds
playing
on
my
phone
.
that
's
why
i
'm
talking
so
fast
.
so
rumble
,
ping
1
ping
2.
so
what
i
'll
do
quickly
is
i
'll
just
test
them
so
i
'll
do
.
let
's
just
do
a
quick
test
to
,
to
listen
to
the
sounds
.
so
,
if
the
mouse
,
when
the
mouse
is
pressed
.
if
mousex
[
sound
]
is
greater
than
uh
,
[
sound
]
well
,
let
's
just
trigger
them
,
actually
,
one
by
one
.
so
ping
[
sound
]
ping1.play
,
[
sound
]
ping2.play
,
[
sound
]
and
rumble.play
,
just
to
make
sure
there
's
no
problems
there
.
okay
.
so
we
've
got
all
,
we
've
loaded
up
the
sounds
,
and
we
are
playing
like
that
.
now
,
because
they
're
sound
effects
,
i
do
n't
want
them
to
loop
.
so
i
'm
just
going
to
tell
them
not
to
loop
.
ping
one
set
looping
,
so
that
's
false
.
okay
.
now
do
that
to
the
other
two
as
well
.
ping
two
set
looping
false
.
rumble
.
right
.
that
's
saved
.
now
i
'm
ready
to
run
it
on
the
device
,
so
let
's
just
tap
the
screen
to
wake
it
up
and
we
hit
play
.
if
i
do
n't
have
any
syntax
errors
they
'll
build
that
app
and
push
it
onto
the
phone
and
hopefully
when
i
tap
the
mouse
button
i
should
hear
all
three
sounds
playing
at
the
same
time
.
[
sound
]
there
they
are
.
that
's
my
sounds
.
now
.
now
,
as
i
said
earlier
,
i
'm
going
to
parametrize
these
sounds
.
so
i
do
n't
want
them
to
be
the
same
sound
every
time
i
play
them
.
so
i
wo
n't
at
,
to
,
to
set
up
,
a
perimeter
i
see
.
so
i
'll
create
a
new
function
,
could
play
sound
.
and
,
so
,
the
,
it
's
going
to
take
an
integer
which
is
what
sound
i
want
to
play
and
,
it
's
going
to
take
another
integer
,
which
is
that
's
where
i
float
,
which
is
going
to
be
the
speed
.
when
in
fact
i
can
just
randomly
generate
the
speed
.
so
if
sound
equals
1
,
ping
1
dot
play
.
then
i
'll
do
a
random
number
.
random
between
0.1
and
2.
so
that
will
play
sorry
.
speed
and
then
ping
1
dot
play
.
okay
,
so
it
sets
the
speed
to
a
random
number
between
0.1
and
2.
and
it
triggers
play
.
and
so
i
'm
just
going
to
copy
that
block
and
,
and
activated
for
the
other
sound
.
so
if
they
,
if
they
pass
it
at
number
2
,
then
we
play
ping
two
.
if
we
pass
a
number
3
,
we
play
rumble
.
rumble
.
all
right
.
so
now
,
i
'm
going
to
just
say
h
,
if
the
mouse
is
pressed
,
play
sound
.
and
i
pass
in
,
again
i
'm
going
to
do
it
random
,
choose
at
random
which
sound
i
want
to
play
.
so
,
it
's
going
to
be
in
the
range
,
one
,
two
,
three
.
okay
.
and
i
'm
going
to
.
cast
that
to
an
integer
,
because
random
normally
gives
you
values
which
have
floating
points
.
right
,
so
,
what
have
i
done
?
i
've
got
my
three
sounds
.
they
're
not
,
they
're
not
looping
.
and
when
i
,
that
's
what
we
call
one
shot
,
as
well
as
loop
,
or
one
shot
is
when
it
plays
once
.
call
play
sound
when
they
press
the
mouse
and
choose
a
random
sound
.
and
then
actually
i
'm
going
to
put
that
up
to
four
,
so
that
it
can
potentially
go
up
to
three
,
because
it
will
round
it
down
.
and
then
finally
i
'm
going
to
trigger
the
sound
and
depending
which
id
comes
in
i
'll
choose
which
sound
.
to
play
.
and
i
'm
setting
the
speed
on
the
sound
up
to
random
.
so
every
time
i
tap
it
should
show
a
different
sound
rather
than
parameters
.
ok.
so
now
,
i
'm
now
ready
to
run
my
code
on
the
phone
.
now
notice
i
had
a
little
error
there
which
i
put
an
l
instead
of
an
i.
so
i
'll
just
change
that
.
so
hopefully
it
should
be
ready
to
go
.
okay
,
so
again
,
we
get
the
same
error
,
run
again
.
that
's
pushing
onto
the
phone
now
.
[
sound
]
there
's
1
more
thing
i
might
add
to
that
,
which
is
i
'm
going
to
cue
the
sound
so
that
they
go
back
to
the
start
before
playing
.
so
,
cue
it
back
to
0
,
that
rewind
it
.
that
's
ready
to
play
ping2.cue
.
[
sound
]
to
note
and
ping3.cue
to
p
,
sorry
it
's
not
called
ping3
,
it
's
called
rumble
.
rumble
cue
to
note
.
so
that
rewind
the
sound
before
i
trigger
it
.
so
let
's
just
run
that
on
,
on
the
phone
and
that
's
our
last
step
.
[
blank_audio
]
[
sound
]
[
music
]
.
okay
,
so
that
's
a
little
bit
of
musique
concrete
for
you
at
the
end
there
.
have
fun
playing
with
this
.
you
can
obviously
make
all
,
all
kinds
of
interesting
sounds
yourself
.
and
you
might
think
of
other
ways
of
maybe
hooking
,
hooking
interactivity
into
that
function
.
so
you
might
add
another
variable
which
controls
the
pitch
so
maybe
it
could
be
pitched
in
different
ways
depending
on
where
the
mouse
is
or
the
accelerometer
data
.
and
you
can
really
make
a
fun
little
instrument
which
,
you
know
,
depending
on
what
you
're
doing
with
the
phone
it
can
trigger
all
different
samples
with
different
dynamics
.
so
do
play
around
with
that
one
and
we
need
to
make
a
music
[
inaudible
]
instrument
with
that
.
what
we
're
going
to
do
based
on
that
is
,
is
develop
a
,
set
of
dynamic
sound
effect
for
a
game
.
