sound 
so that week four 
youve seen to use a physics 
engine to make a basic game 
use physics really 
bring richness to game play 
strong interactivity 
theres a mass games there 
mobile platforms 
maybe you want to talk a little bit 

well 
potential 
well there is a lot potential 
you use kind 
techniques to easily make a casual game 
casual gaming is one 
big coming genres in markets 
so you here, sort game 
you play youre bus 
youre train 
really engaging 
really, really small changes in 
way that you use massive impact 
you know you, you cant, quite 
difficult to get exactly thing 
time although always 
deterministic 
so always if you get 
thing 
so yeah a really useful thing 
making games 
also we a little bit 
sound inaudible, collision didnt 
we 
yeah so, so usual we try to get 
creative sounds well 
graphics, so, so, so we were, we 
looking 
this way sort working 
opposite direction to we last 
week 
so we kind parameterizing 
audio going in 
graphics 
so we kind sending back impacts 
velocities from, physics engine 
using that to control playback 
yeah, that worked really well 
so theres a lot you could 
always, a thing to get you 
started 
a jumping point 
i mean, i think you can, theres, 
you look game you already play 
see games android 
iphone markets 
loads use physics you 
could probably start figuring 
theyre built trying to build 
versions 
inaudible yeah 
coming games 
thats right 
inaudible if 
going to go away 
a genre is going to around 
a long time 
something is easy enough 
you to build in d source 
engaging 
so yeah you dont to make big d 
monstrosities to making, to big in 
games market 
next week going to 
something is a bit 
complicated 
going a bit deeper 
facebook integration also using 
stuff like camera mobile 
device 
so thats going to an interesting 
week 
theres a lot new stuff there 
a lot people interested in social 
media integration that 
really kind covering that 

so remember to check forums, 
to talk to students there 
able to, you know 
going to respond to you 
questions that you 
well see you next week
