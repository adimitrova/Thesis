1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:18,208
[SOUND]. 

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,829
so that was week four. 
And you've seen how to use a physics 

3
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,510
engine to make a basic game. 
And how the use of physics can really 

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,929
bring richness to the game play and 
strong interactivity. 

5
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,360
And there's a mass of games out there on 
mobile platforms. 

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,865
Maybe you want to talk a little bit 
about. 

7
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:36,900
 >> Well. 
 >> The potential. 

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,448
 >> Well there is a lot of potential 
because you can use those kind of 

9
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:44,435
techniques to easily make a casual game. 
And casual gaming is the it's one of the 

10
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:48,895
big up and coming genres in markets. 
So you can here, it's the sort of game 

11
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,110
which you can play when you're on the bus 
or you're on the train. 

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,198
And it's really engaging. 
Because really, really small changes in 

13
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,757
the way that you use and massive impact. 
And you know you, you cant, it's quite 

14
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:01,235
difficult to get exactly the same thing 
each time although it's always 

15
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:04,020
deterministic. 
So it's always the same if you get the 

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,006
same thing. 
So yeah it's a really useful thing for 

17
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:08,210
making games. 
But also we did a little bit of some 

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,796
sound [INAUDIBLE], and collision didn't 
we? 

19
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:13,928
 >> Yeah so, so as usual we try to get 
creative with the sounds as well as the 

20
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:17,826
graphics, so, so, so we were, we were 
looking at how. 

21
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:21,228
This way we're sort of working from the 
opposite direction to how we did last 

22
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:23,996
week. 
So we were kind of parameterizing the 

23
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,818
audio from what was going on in the 
graphics. 

24
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:30,369
So we were kind of sending back impacts 
velocities from, from the physics engine 

25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:35,690
and using that to control the playback. 
 >> Yeah, that worked really well. 

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,140
So there's a lot more you could do. 
As always, its just a thing to get you 

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,148
started. 
It's a jumping off point. 

28
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:43,968
 >> I mean, I think you can, there's, 
you can look at the game you already play 

29
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:47,782
and see all the games on the the android 
and iPhone markets. 

30
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:50,634
And loads of them use physics and you 
could probably start figuring out how 

31
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,736
they're built and trying to build your 
own versions. 

32
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:55,850
 >> [INAUDIBLE] Yeah. 
 >> Or coming out with your own games. 

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,990
 >> that's right. 
 >> [INAUDIBLE] It's not as if it's 

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,162
going to go away. 
It's a genre which is going to be around 

35
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,724
for a long time. 
And it's something which is easy enough 

36
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:06,090
for you to build in 2D with any source of 
engaging. 

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,756
So yeah you don't have to make big 3D 
monstrosities to be making, to be big in 

38
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,934
the games market. 
Next week we're going to be doing 

39
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,060
something which is a bit more 
complicated. 

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,430
We're going a bit deeper. 
It's Facebook integration and also using 

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,510
stuff like the camera from your mobile 
device. 

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,550
So that's going to be an interesting 
week. 

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,351
There's a lot of new stuff there. 
A lot of people are interested in social 

44
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:29,504
media and integration and that. 
We're really kind of covering that all 

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,943
over then. 
So and remember to check the forums, and 

46
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,305
to talk to our students who are there who 
are able to, you know. 

47
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,490
Who are going to respond to you and any 
questions that you have. 

48
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,155
And we'll see you next week.
