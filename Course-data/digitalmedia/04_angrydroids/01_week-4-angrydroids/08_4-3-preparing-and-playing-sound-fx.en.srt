00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:17,649
[MUSIC]. 

3
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,943
Hello! 
Today in this lesson, I'm going to show 

4
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:25,101
you how to create some simple sound 
effects for, for a collision-based game 

5
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:30,436
that we're going to develop later in the 
lessons this week. 

6
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:33,376
And I'm then going to show you how to 
import those into your, your project 

7
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:36,561
quickly which, which is revision, you've 
already seen how to do that, but will 

8
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:41,740
just do it do the workflow again, just to 
show you that. 

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,770
I now want you to get really creative 
with these sound effects. 

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,460
You know collisions are great fun to 
make. 

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,145
I am just going to demonstrate some quick 
examples of how to do that but I want you 

12
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:53,940
to go for make your own sounds and once 
we got those collision sound effects into 

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,270
the application, what we going to do is 
figure out how to trigger them. 

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,420
But not just play them as they are, we 
want to play them with a bit more a bit 

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,248
of dynamic range on them. 
So what we'll do is, is parameterize the 

16
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:10,330
playback, so that depending on the number 
that comes in they might be played back 

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,420
in a different way. 
So let's make some sound effects. 

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,450
So I've already loaded up audacity which 
is a simple open-source. 

19
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,565
Audio editor and I'm just going to record 
straight into this, and my laptop mic. 

20
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:27,637
Of course you could record with much 
higher quality microphones if you like, 

21
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:32,202
and you'll get a better sound, but this 
will do just for demonstration purposes. 

22
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:37,050
So, I hit record, and then I'm going to 
make my sound effects. 

23
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:49,485
[MUSIC] Okay so I've now recorded a few 
sound effects lets just listen to those 

24
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:59,401
they're not quite healthy on the wave 
form display. 

25
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:05,510
[SOUND] Okay there fine. 
I quite like that. 

26
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:13,429
That's a good one. 
That's a quite nice one. 

27
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:14,490
And. 
[SOUND] There's one. 

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,810
So I'm going to take these uh, [SOUND] 
these three sounds and use these. 

29
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,090
Okay, so, first of all, I'll do, I'll 
convert to mono. 

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:31,415
So, it's track, stereo track to mono. 
Okay and then I will trim them down. 

31
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:35,971
So, it's good if you want to, if you want 
to, cause they're sound effects, you want 

32
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:41,235
them to trigger very accurately. 
So, it's best if you trim them right 

33
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:46,026
down. 
Okay, so, let's get the whole thing. 

34
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:51,004
That'll do. 
Copy that, paste it into a new one, then 

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:59,660
export and I'm going to put it into, I'm 
going to create a folder sound effects. 

36
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,536
And this one's going to be ping one dot 
wav. 

37
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:10,570
Okay. 
[SOUND] Close that. 

38
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:18,508
Then I've got the next ping. 
Zoom in. 

39
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:21,900
Make sure we've got a nice trim on it so 
that it's right up against the start the 

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,300
sound. 
And you can even duck into the sound a 

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000
bit because they're sound effects, 
they're a little bit of a click. 

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,656
It's not too much of a problem. 
So, Edit, I can actually export directly 

43
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:35,565
from my selection. 
ping2.wav. 

44
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:39,846
[SOUND] Then I'm going to get 

45
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,430
[INAUDIBLE]. 

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,200
What have I got here? 
I'm just going to use this rumble sound 

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,119
here [NOISE]. 
Okay and export that file, export 

48
00:03:54,119 --> 00:04:03,704
selection and rumble. 
Don't laugh. 

49
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,326
Okay. 
Get rid of that. 

50
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:11,020
Now I'm going to import these into my 
sketch. 

51
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,112
So my s-, I need to find the data folder 
for my sketch and it's called Android 

52
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:19,775
sound effects. 
There's the data folder. 

53
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:24,550
I've put all these into this folder 
called fx, so I'll copy those. 

54
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,649
Paste them into there. 
So I've got ping1, ping2 and rumble. 

55
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,253
you m-, yeah, remember that all the files 
that you put in the data folder will be 

56
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,575
included in your sketch. 
So you might want to just trim it down to 

57
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:41,362
just the ones that you need. 
so let's just get rid of The ones we 

58
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:46,345
don't need. 
Alright so we just got ping1, ping2 and 

59
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:49,275
rumble. 
So we've got all our files they're all 

60
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:52,110
ready to go just need to import, need to 
load them up so I'm going to have three 

61
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,021
players. 
play 1, you might because they're sound 

62
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:00,636
effects you might want to call them call 
the players something more sensible like, 

63
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:05,290
that relates to the sound they might 
make. 

64
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,530
So I've got ping one ping two and rumble, 
okay? 

65
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,966
That, that will make it easier to read 
the codes, know which one you're 

66
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:15,070
triggering. 
Okay? 

67
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,720
Now, so then I load them in. 
Ping one. 

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,053
Ping 2, then rumble. 
I wouldn't [UNKNOWN] here these sounds 

69
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:30,731
playing on my phone. 
That's why I'm talking so fast. 

70
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:37,829
So rumble, ping 1 Ping 2. 
So what I'll do quickly is I'll just test 

71
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:44,810
them So I'll do. 
let's just do a quick test to, to listen 

72
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,598
to the sounds. 
So, if the mouse, when the mouse is 

73
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:54,045
pressed. 
If mouseX [SOUND] is greater than uh, 

74
00:05:54,045 --> 00:06:00,003
[SOUND] well, let's just trigger them, 
actually, one by one. 

75
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:07,619
So ping [SOUND] ping1.play, [SOUND] 
ping2.play, [SOUND] and rumble.play, just 

76
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:13,360
to make sure there's no problems there. 
Okay. 

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,181
So we've got all, we've loaded up the 
sounds, and we are playing like that. 

78
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:21,512
Now, because they're sound effects, I 
don't want them to loop. 

79
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:24,236
So I'm just going to tell them not to 
loop. 

80
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:31,914
Ping one set looping, so that's false. 
Okay. 

81
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:38,912
Now do that to the other two as well. 
Ping two set looping false. 

82
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:44,050
Rumble. 
Right. 

83
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,740
That's saved. 
Now I'm ready to run it on the device, so 

84
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,390
let's just tap the screen to wake it up 
and we hit play. 

85
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,013
If I don't have any syntax errors they'll 
build that app and push it onto the phone 

86
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:01,705
and hopefully when I tap the mouse button 
I should hear all three sounds playing at 

87
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:15,895
the same time. 
[SOUND] There they are. 

88
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,410
That's my sounds. 
Now. 

89
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,280
Now, as I said earlier, I'm going to 
parametrize these sounds. 

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,638
So I don't want them to be the same sound 
every time I play them. 

91
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:31,740
So I won't at, to, to set up, a perimeter 
I see. 

92
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,371
So I'll create a new function, could play 
sound. 

93
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,739
and, so, the, it's going to take an 
integer which is what sound I want to 

94
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:45,547
play and, it's going to take another 
integer, which is That's where I float, 

95
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:53,882
which is going to be the speed. 
When in fact I can just randomly generate 

96
00:07:53,882 --> 00:08:04,810
the speed. 
so if sound equals 1, ping 1 dot play. 

97
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,774
Then I'll do a random number. 
Random between 0.1 and 2. 

98
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:15,938
So that will play sorry. 
Speed and then ping 1 dot play. 

99
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:23,040
Okay, so it sets the speed to a random 
number between 0.1 and 2. 

100
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,455
And it triggers play. 
And so I'm just going to copy that block 

101
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:32,881
and, and Activated for the other sound. 
So if they, if they pass it at number 2, 

102
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:39,344
then we play ping two. 
If we pass a number 3, we play rumble. 

103
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:43,556
Rumble. 
All right. 

104
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:51,331
So now, I'm going to just say h, if the 
mouse is pressed, play sound. 

105
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,258
And I pass in, 
Again I'm going to do it random, choose 

106
00:08:54,258 --> 00:09:02,224
at random which sound I want to play. 
So, it's going to be in the range, one, 

107
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:07,740
two, three. 
Okay. 

108
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,747
And I'm going to. 
Cast that to an integer, because random 

109
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,400
normally gives you values which have 
floating points. 

110
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,230
Right, so, what have I done? 
I've got my three sounds. 

111
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,554
They're not, they're not looping. 
And when I, that's what we call one shot, 

112
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:23,710
as well as loop, or one shot is when it 
plays once. 

113
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,255
call play sound when they press the mouse 
and choose a random sound. 

114
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:33,139
And then actually I'm going to put that 
up to four, so that it can potentially go 

115
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,370
up to three, because it will round it 
down. 

116
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,417
And then finally I'm going to trigger the 
sound and depending which id comes in 

117
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:49,420
I'll choose which sound. 
To play. 

118
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,500
And I'm setting the speed on the sound up 
to random. 

119
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,070
So every time I tap it should show a 
different sound rather than parameters. 

120
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,860
OK. 
So now, I'm now ready to run my code on 

121
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,355
the phone. 
Now notice I had a little error there 

122
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:06,280
which I put an l instead of an i. 
So I'll just change that. 

123
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,188
So hopefully it should be ready to go. 
Okay, so again, we get the same error, 

124
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:27,642
run again. 
That's pushing onto the phone now. 

125
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:43,707
[SOUND] There's 1 more thing I might add 
to that, which is I'm going to cue the 

126
00:10:43,707 --> 00:11:02,090
sound so that they go back to the start 
before playing. 

127
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,886
So, cue it back to 0, that rewind it. 
That's ready to play ping2.cue. 

128
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,652
[SOUND] To note and ping3.cue to p, sorry 
it's not called ping3, it's called 

129
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,380
rumble. 
Rumble cue to note. 

130
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,950
So that rewind the sound before I trigger 
it. 

131
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,535
So let's just run that on, on the phone 
and that's our last step. 

132
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:34,927
[BLANK_AUDIO] 

133
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,007
[SOUND] 

134
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,091
[MUSIC]. 

135
00:11:41,091 --> 00:12:13,650
Okay, so that's a little bit of musique 
concrete for you at the end there. 

136
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,478
Have fun playing with this. 
You can obviously make all, all kinds of 

137
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:19,922
interesting sounds yourself. 
And you might think of other ways of 

138
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:23,070
maybe hooking, hooking interactivity into 
that function. 

139
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,930
So you might add another variable which 
controls the pitch so maybe it could be 

140
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,834
pitched in different ways depending on 
where the mouse is or the accelerometer 

141
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,770
data. 
And you can really make a fun little 

142
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,120
instrument which, you know, depending on 
what you're doing with the phone it can 

143
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,970
trigger all different samples with 
different Dynamics. 

144
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,550
So do play around with that one and we 
need to make a music [INAUDIBLE] 

145
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,612
instrument with that. 
What we're going to do based on that is, 

146
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:48,980
is develop a, set of dynamic sound effect 
for a game. 

147
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:48,980
[MUSIC]
