[SOUND] [MUSIC] Hi, and welcome to week 
four, of Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Applications. 
I'm Mick, and this is Marco and Matt. Today we're going to be looking at making 
a basic game. But we're going to focus on a certain 
type of game. A physics-based game that you can run on 
a mobile device. These are really, really popular casual 
games, and they're, I think for two reasons. 
Firstly because it's nice to be able to run something which uses physics on your 
phone. But in addition to that, it's something 
which has got us a dynamic game play. So, when you use physics in a game, you 
can never be quite sure what's going to happen and it, very, very small changes 
in the way that you use the game can have a big effect on your game world. 
so this is the first time we've done a game, and it's going to, I think, take a 
step up in the intensity. In the, complexity of some of the 
programming that we're doing. Mark has got a big chunk of stuff to tell 
you about physics. He's built his own physics engine, which, 
integrates Java and Javascript in a really neat way, and works entirely in 
processing. And then, Matt's going to use that to do 
some interesting stuff triggering sound effects and actually generating and 
triggering that sound effects entirely based on collisions that happen in the 
game world. So there is a lot of interesting stuff 
this week, there is also a little demo of an app that we have built for you called, 
Angry Droids, which I can tell you has absolutely nothing to do with any other 
2D physics based games that you might of played. 
fine so without further ado, I think we're going to start with Marco.
