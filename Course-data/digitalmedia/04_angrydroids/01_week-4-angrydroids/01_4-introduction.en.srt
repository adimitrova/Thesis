[SOUND] [MUSIC] Hi, and welcome to week 
four, of Creative Programming for Digital 

2
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:26,830
Media and Mobile Applications. 
I'm Mick, and this is Marco and Matt. 

3
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,030
Today we're going to be looking at making 
a basic game. 

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,024
But we're going to focus on a certain 
type of game. 

5
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,350
A physics-based game that you can run on 
a mobile device. 

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,374
These are really, really popular casual 
games, and they're, I think for two 

7
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,698
reasons. 
Firstly because it's nice to be able to 

8
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,932
run something which uses physics on your 
phone. 

9
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:47,620
But in addition to that, it's something 
which has got us a dynamic game play. 

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,853
So, when you use physics in a game, you 
can never be quite sure what's going to 

11
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:54,457
happen and it, very, very small changes 
in the way that you use the game can have 

12
00:00:54,457 --> 00:01:00,130
a big effect on your game world. 
so this is the first time we've done a 

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,820
game, and it's going to, I think, take a 
step up in the intensity. 

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,210
In the, complexity of some of the 
programming that we're doing. 

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,180
Mark has got a big chunk of stuff to tell 
you about physics. 

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,304
He's built his own physics engine, which, 
integrates Java and Javascript in a 

17
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:16,570
really neat way, and works entirely in 
processing. 

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,665
And then, Matt's going to use that to do 
some interesting stuff triggering sound 

19
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,760
effects and actually generating and 
triggering that sound effects entirely 

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,520
based on collisions that happen in the 
game world. 

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,406
So there is a lot of interesting stuff 
this week, there is also a little demo of 

22
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:37,118
an app that we have built for you called, 
Angry Droids, which I can tell you has 

23
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,946
absolutely nothing to do with any other 
2D physics based games that you might of 

24
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:46,914
played. 
fine so without further ado, I think 

25
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:49,090
we're going to start with Marco.
