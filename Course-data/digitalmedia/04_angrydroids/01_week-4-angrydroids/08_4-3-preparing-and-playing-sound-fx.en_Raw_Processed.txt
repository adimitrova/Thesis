sound 
music 
hello 
today in this lesson, im going to show 
you to create simple sound 
effects for, a collisionbased game 
that going to develop later in 
lessons this week 
im going to show you to 
import your, project 
quickly which, is revision, youve 
already seen to that, will 
workflow again, to 
show you that 
i want you to get really creative 
sound effects 
you know collisions great fun to 
make 
i going to demonstrate quick 
examples to that i want you 
to go make sounds 
we got collision sound effects 
application, we going to is 
figure to trigger 
play are, we 
want to play a bit a bit 
dynamic range 
so well is, is parameterize 
playback, so that depending number 
that comes in might played back 
in a different way 
so lets make sound effects 
so ive already loaded audacity 
is a simple opensource 
audio editor im going to record 
straight this, laptop mic 
course you could record much 
higher quality microphones if you like, 
youll get a better sound, this 
will demonstration purposes 
so, i hit record, im going to 
make sound effects 
music okay so ive recorded a few 
sound effects lets listen to 
theyre quite healthy wave 
form display 
sound okay there fine 
i quite like that 
thats a good one 
thats a quite nice one 

sound theres one 
so im going to take uh, sound 
three sounds use 
okay, so, first all, ill do, ill 
convert to mono 
so, track, stereo track to mono 
okay i will trim 
so, good if you want to, if you want 
to, cause theyre sound effects, you want 
to trigger accurately 
so, best if you trim right 

okay, so, lets get whole thing 
thatll 
copy that, paste a new one, 
export im going to put into, im 
going to create a folder sound effects 
this ones going to ping one dot 
wav 
okay 
sound close that 
ive got next ping 
zoom in 
make sure weve got a nice trim so 
that right start 
sound 
you even duck sound a 
bit theyre sound effects, 
theyre a little bit a click 
much a problem 
so, edit, i actually export directly 
selection 
pingwav 
sound im going to get 
inaudible 
i got here 
im going to use this rumble sound 
here noise 
okay export that file, export 
selection rumble 
dont laugh 
okay 
get rid that 
im going to import 
sketch 
so s, i need to find data folder 
sketch called android 
sound effects 
theres data folder 
ive put this folder 
called fx, so ill copy 
paste there 
so ive got ping, ping rumble 
you m, yeah, remember that files 
that you put in data folder will 
included in sketch 
so you might want to trim to 
ones that you need 
so lets get rid ones we 
dont need 
alright so we got ping, ping 
rumble 
so weve got files theyre 
ready to go need to import, need to 
load so im going to three 
players 
play , you might theyre sound 
effects you might want to call call 
players something sensible like, 
that relates to sound might 
make 
so ive got ping one ping two rumble, 
okay 
that, that will make easier to read 
codes, know one youre 
triggering 
okay 
now, so i load in 
ping one 
ping , rumble 
i wouldnt unknown here sounds 
playing phone 
thats im talking so fast 
so rumble, ping ping 
so ill quickly is ill test 
so ill 
lets a quick test to, to listen 
to sounds 
so, if mouse, mouse is 
pressed 
if mousex sound is greater uh, 
sound well, lets trigger them, 
actually, one one 
so ping sound pingplay, sound 
pingplay, sound rumbleplay, 
to make sure theres problems there 
okay 
so weve got all, weve loaded 
sounds, we playing like that 
now, theyre sound effects, i 
dont want to loop 
so im going to tell to 
loop 
ping one set looping, so thats false 
okay 
that to two well 
ping two set looping false 
rumble 
right 
thats saved 
im ready to run device, so 
lets tap screen to wake 
we hit play 
if i dont syntax errors theyll 
build that app push onto phone 
hopefully i tap mouse button 
i hear three sounds playing 
time 
sound there 
thats sounds 

now, i said earlier, im going to 
parametrize sounds 
so i dont want to sound 
every time i play 
so i wont at, to, to set up, a perimeter 
i see 
so ill create a new function, could play 
sound 
and, so, the, going to take an 
integer is sound i want to 
play and, going to take another 
integer, is thats i float, 
is going to speed 
in fact i randomly generate 
speed 
so if sound equals , ping dot play 
ill a random number 
random between 
so that will play sorry 
speed ping dot play 
okay, so sets speed to a random 
number between 
triggers play 
so im going to copy that block 
and, activated sound 
so if they, if pass number , 
we play ping two 
if we pass a number , we play rumble 
rumble 
right 
so now, im going to say h, if 
mouse is pressed, play sound 
i pass in, 
im going to random, choose 
random sound i want to play 
so, going to in range, one, 
two, three 
okay 
im going to 
cast that to an integer, random 
normally gives you values 
floating points 
right, so, i done 
ive got three sounds 
theyre not, theyre looping 
i, thats we call one shot, 
well loop, one shot is 
plays 
call play sound press mouse 
choose a random sound 
actually im going to put that 
to four, so that potentially go 
to three, will round 

finally im going to trigger 
sound depending id comes in 
ill choose sound 
to play 
im setting speed sound 
to random 
so every time i tap show a 
different sound rather parameters 
ok 
so now, im ready to run code 
phone 
notice i a little error there 
i put an l instead an i 
so ill change that 
so hopefully ready to go 
okay, so again, we get error, 
run 
thats pushing onto phone 
sound theres thing i might add 
to that, is im going to cue 
sound so that go back to start 
playing 
so, cue back to , that rewind 
thats ready to play pingcue 
sound to note pingcue to p, sorry 
called ping, called 
rumble 
rumble cue to note 
so that rewind sound i trigger 

so lets run that on, phone 
thats last step 
blankaudio 
sound 
music 
okay, so thats a little bit musique 
concrete you end there 
fun playing this 
you obviously make all, kinds 
interesting sounds 
you might think ways 
maybe hooking, hooking interactivity 
that function 
so you might add another variable 
controls pitch so maybe could 
pitched in different ways depending 
mouse is accelerometer 
data 
you really make a fun little 
instrument which, you know, depending 
youre phone 
trigger different samples 
different dynamics 
so play around that one we 
need to make a music inaudible 
instrument that 
going to based that is, 
is develop a, set dynamic sound effect 
a game 
music
