noise 
so, weve talked objects 
the, things that affect objects may 
move forces 
im going to talk a couple forces 
that well work 
first force is pervasive gravity 
basically always going to 
force downwards that pulls objects 
doesnt to downwards you 
actually set gravity to move to left 
even if you want a space world 
time youre going to 
a force pulling things downwards 
thats automatically built 
worlds 
so, you dont to anything to get 
gravity 
you use set gravity commands to 
change gravity force 
a vector 
so you have, moment, gravity 
is something like , minus 
x minus y so its, vertical, you 
horizontal gravity if you give 
a, an x value 
another kind force is an impulse 
thats basically a force thats applied 
a particular moment in time 
so, sometimes you want to push an 
object in a certain direction to get 
moving applying impulses is a good 
way 
applied one moment, 
like kicking an object 
this is you 
an impulse is a vector 
you create a new vector whatever 
values you want so that youd call new 
vec 
thats a vector type 
you pass in x y coordinates 
that vector 
actually a direction 
say , we mostly vertical, we 
mostly downwards a bit across 
you call apply impulse 
command box 
so you boxapplyimpluse that 
applies impluse to that box 
you pass in you to say 
impulse is acting 
so you apply an impulse to different 
bits box 
often you want to apply to 
center box so going to 
spin around 
if you apply to edge 
box, you, bo, box wont move, 
will also spin around 
you obviously to apply past 
impulse that function 
im going to show a bit a complex 
example that mick will following 
later in, in, in code hes going 
to show you 
cough to implement a catapult 
so weve got a ball thats a piece 
elastic we pull that ball, 
back we pull it, we release 
it, will fly in direction that 
weve pulling back 
so two things we need to know will 
fly in direction elastic 
but, we pull elastic back 
will fly 
so, depends distance 
direction catapult to 
ball produces is an impulse 
thats applied to ball 
so that impulse, if you remember i 
saying vectors earlier 
is based vector that goes 
ball to catapult 
in that direction, 
that growth distance is, 
bigger force is going to 
thats fine, that vector includes 
that 
so vector ball to 
catapult is simply catapult minus ball 
catapult is vector position 
catapult 
ball is vector position ball 
we multiply that constant c 
so, you know, so weve got a 
bit control big that 
impulse is 
so we vary that to make a bigger 
force or, a lesser force 
tweak 
you, youre working 
physics theres a lot tweaking 
to to make sure that densities 
the, the, constants right 
get right feel that moving 
right dynamically enough without 
things going place 
so, if we look here we 
calculation we create first an impulse 
vector 
thats a vector 
we set value to equal to 
position catapult 
we subtract position 
ball 
finally, we multiply a constant, 
in this case, , quite a big number to 
get a quite a dynamic move 
well see that later in example 
that micks going to show you 
final kind force, maybe 
important one physics engine is 
collisions 
a lot a physics engine is 
handle objects collide 
bounce 
gets that, collisions 
absolutely physically correct 
and, you see in example, weve got 
objects bouncing crates, 
objects bouncing sides 
screen, stuff bouncing everywhere 
thats handled physics engine 
um, cough in a, in a sense, you dont 
really need to anything 
to handle collisions physics engine 
will everything you 
sometimes you want to know a 
collisions happening 
so, example, you might want to, 
increase score whenever a collision 
happens 
as, matthew would show you, you 
may want to you may want to play a sound 
whenever you a collision 
so you need to know theres a 
collision 
in first extension using, we 
this in a simple way 
you create a function in 
program called collision 
that to look exactly like this 
to collision 
takes three parameters 
body body impulse 
so body body 
objects that colliding 

impulse parameter is big 
force impulse collision 

so thats really useful 
you find objects 
colliding 
so, depending objects there are, 
you make different sounds 
you make use big 
collision 
so maybe if collision small, 
you dont make a sound 
maybe a bigger collision, you make a 
bigger sound 
so, 
three parameters you 
really control exactly happens in 
program different collisions 
happen 
next, matthew will talk 
to create a sound engine 
produce different results, based 
different objects with, varying 
parameters sound, is exactly 
we need to change sound whenever 
an impulse is played 
hes done that, mick will show you 
full example that physics objects 
colliding place audio 
triggered physics objects 
music
