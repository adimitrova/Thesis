[sound]. 
so that was week four. 
and you've seen how to use a physics 
engine to make a basic game. 
and how the use of physics can really 
bring richness to the game play and 
strong interactivity. 
and there's a mass of games out there on 
mobile platforms. 
maybe you want to talk a little bit 
about. 
 >> well. 
 >> the potential. 
 >> well there is a lot of potential 
because you can use those kind of 
techniques to easily make a casual game. 
and casual gaming is the it's one of the 
big up and coming genres in markets. 
so you can here, it's the sort of game 
which you can play when you're on the bus 
or you're on the train. 
and it's really engaging. 
because really, really small changes in 
the way that you use and massive impact. 
and you know you, you cant, it's quite 
difficult to get exactly the same thing 
each time although it's always 
deterministic. 
so it's always the same if you get the 
same thing. 
so yeah it's a really useful thing for 
making games. 
but also we did a little bit of some 
sound [inaudible], and collision didn't 
we? 
 >> yeah so, so as usual we try to get 
creative with the sounds as well as the 
graphics, so, so, so we were, we were 
looking at how. 
this way we're sort of working from the 
opposite direction to how we did last 
week. 
so we were kind of parameterizing the 
audio from what was going on in the 
graphics. 
so we were kind of sending back impacts 
velocities from, from the physics engine 
and using that to control the playback. 
 >> yeah, that worked really well. 
so there's a lot more you could do. 
as always, its just a thing to get you 
started. 
it's a jumping off point. 
 >> i mean, i think you can, there's, 
you can look at the game you already play 
and see all the games on the the android 
and iphone markets. 
and loads of them use physics and you 
could probably start figuring out how 
they're built and trying to build your 
own versions. 
 >> [inaudible] yeah. 
 >> or coming out with your own games. 
 >> that's right. 
 >> [inaudible] it's not as if it's 
going to go away. 
it's a genre which is going to be around 
for a long time. 
and it's something which is easy enough 
for you to build in 2d with any source of 
engaging. 
so yeah you don't have to make big 3d 
monstrosities to be making, to be big in 
the games market. 
next week we're going to be doing 
something which is a bit more 
complicated. 
we're going a bit deeper. 
it's facebook integration and also using 
stuff like the camera from your mobile 
device. 
so that's going to be an interesting 
week. 
there's a lot of new stuff there. 
a lot of people are interested in social 
media and integration and that. 
we're really kind of covering that all 
over then. 
so and remember to check the forums, and 
to talk to our students who are there who 
are able to, you know. 
who are going to respond to you and any 
questions that you have. 
and we'll see you next week.
