sound music hi, welcome to week 
four, creative programming digital 
media mobile applications 
im mick, this is marco matt 
today going to looking making 
a basic game 
going to focus a certain 
type game 
a physicsbased game that you run 
a mobile device 
really, really popular casual 
games, theyre, i think two 
reasons 
firstly nice to able to 
run something uses physics 
phone 
in addition to that, something 
got us a dynamic game play 
so, you use physics in a game, you 
never quite sure whats going to 
happen it, very, small changes 
in way that you use game 
a big effect game world 
so this is first time weve done a 
game, going to, i think, take a 
step in intensity 
in the, complexity 
programming that 
mark got a big chunk stuff to tell 
you physics 
hes built physics engine, which, 
integrates java javascript in a 
really neat way, works entirely in 
processing 
then, matts going to use that to 
interesting stuff triggering sound 
effects actually generating 
triggering that sound effects entirely 
based collisions that happen in 
game world 
so there is a lot interesting stuff 
this week, there is also a little demo 
an app that we built you called, 
angry droids, i tell you 
absolutely nothing to 
d physics based games that you might 
played 
fine so without ado, i think 
going to start marco
