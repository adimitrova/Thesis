hi
,
and
welcome
to
week
four
,
of
creative
programming
for
digital
media
and
mobile
applications
.
i
'm
mick
,
and
this
is
marco
and
matt
.
today
we
're
going
to
be
looking
at
making
a
basic
game
.
but
we
're
going
to
focus
on
a
certain
type
of
game
.
a
physics-based
game
that
you
can
run
on
a
mobile
device
.
these
are
really
,
really
popular
casual
games
,
and
they
're
,
i
think
for
two
reasons
.
firstly
because
it
's
nice
to
be
able
to
run
something
which
uses
physics
on
your
phone
.
but
in
addition
to
that
,
it
's
something
which
has
got
us
a
dynamic
game
play
.
so
,
when
you
use
physics
in
a
game
,
you
can
never
be
quite
sure
what
's
going
to
happen
and
it
,
very
,
very
small
changes
in
the
way
that
you
use
the
game
can
have
a
big
effect
on
your
game
world
.
so
this
is
the
first
time
we
've
done
a
game
,
and
it
's
going
to
,
i
think
,
take
a
step
up
in
the
intensity
.
in
the
,
complexity
of
some
of
the
programming
that
we
're
doing
.
mark
has
got
a
big
chunk
of
stuff
to
tell
you
about
physics
.
he
's
built
his
own
physics
engine
,
which
,
integrates
java
and
javascript
in
a
really
neat
way
,
and
works
entirely
in
processing
.
and
then
,
matt
's
going
to
use
that
to
do
some
interesting
stuff
triggering
sound
effects
and
actually
generating
and
triggering
that
sound
effects
entirely
based
on
collisions
that
happen
in
the
game
world
.
so
there
is
a
lot
of
interesting
stuff
this
week
,
there
is
also
a
little
demo
of
an
app
that
we
have
built
for
you
called
,
angry
droids
,
which
i
can
tell
you
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
2d
physics
based
games
that
you
might
of
played
.
fine
so
without
further
ado
,
i
think
we
're
going
to
start
with
marco
.
