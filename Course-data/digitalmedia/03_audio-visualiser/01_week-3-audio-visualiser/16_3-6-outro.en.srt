1
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:18,479
[NOISE]. 

2
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:20,907
What did we do this week Mick? 
What do we do? 

3
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:25,796
We built some audio visualizers. 
So yeah we did some [UNKNOWN] graphics 

4
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:29,745
and we did some sound analysis. 
So how did that go? 

5
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:33,705
 >> : Well I mean the sound analysis 
basically you're just trying to get some 

6
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:38,576
numbers out of some other numbers. 
 >> [LAUGH] :That's the most annoying 

7
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:42,052
thing in the world. 
Its quite a kind of dark art, isn't it? 

8
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,285
It's a dark art and understanding what 
those numbers mean is what it's all 

9
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:46,548
about. 
 >> Yeah. 

10
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:50,020
 >> So I don't really emphasize that 
some numbers tell you about the different 

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,716
aspects of the sounds so is it bassy, is 
it trebly and it's really important once 

12
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:57,132
you've got an understanding of those 
numbers to try and put those in to the 

13
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:03,965
rest of your applications so that's where 
Marco came in trying to explain. 

14
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,896
The parameterization of graphics. 
 >> Actually yeah, there's a thing about 

15
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,836
that Marco we used a really basic 
visualization technique this week but 

16
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:13,530
there's lot different types of approaches 
you can take. 

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,770
What's a good way for people to go and 
find out better methods for drawing 

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,554
stuff. 
 >> We'll got you know there's Pricing's 

19
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:22,882
a really powerful tool set you'll 
expanding your knowledge of Pricing/g, so 

20
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:27,678
there's a lot to play with. 
But I would say the best place to go for 

21
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:32,208
ideas is the open processing website. 
It's where people go to post their work 

22
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,934
they've done in processing really created 
people or doing exciting work and it's a 

23
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:40,760
fantastic source of idea and you can get 
the code there. 

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,576
Some of it might be a little advanced for 
you at the moment but you can also get a 

25
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:47,123
lot ideas not only what people can do, 
but how they did it. 

26
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,048
Yeah and it's good as well because those 
sorts of techniques they show you a lot 

27
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:52,928
you can learn really fast by looking at 
other peoples code and it's nice vital 

28
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,264
community. 
But speaking of communities, you should 

29
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,765
check the forums out if you have any 
questions and you know you should be at 

30
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:02,210
the stage now where you should be able to 
help each other. 

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,708
And but ask students is there students in 
more courses and if you've got anymore 

32
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,630
questions you can always ask. 
 >> That's it for this week. 

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,193
We'll see you next week where we're going 
to be doing a game. 

34
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,006
Aren't we? 
 >> Yes. 

35
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,470
[CROSSTALK] That's right. 
 >> We are. 

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,100
So, we'll see you for week four next 
week.  [SOUND]
