this week going to looking 
audio visualization 
so that means algorithmic drawing in 
comptuer graphics 
so ways making abstract shapes 
complex shapes translations 
rotations different kinds 
geometry 
audio analysis 
so, that really means is, 
understanding whats played back in 
a sound turning numbers 
useful changing way that 
somethings drawn 
so, theres quite a big chunk graphics 
to translation, rotation, 
transformations, theres a nice chunk 
analysis 
if youre interested in audio, you 
a background in audio, i think 
theres a lot good stuff you 
there 
ill a kind putting 
together bit end 
stuff i always 
literally showing you we combine 
analysis combine graphics to make 
something you might find alongside 
something like, i dont know, itunes 
xbox audio player 
so, theres a market visualizers 
theres a market techniques 
visualization 
making something that 
works i tunes although theres a lot 
money to made in that market 
also to to analyze 
audio theres an increasing amount 
applications that really need to that 
including stuff like shazam is a 
really useful application 
so, going to start to thinking 
things to put 
together
