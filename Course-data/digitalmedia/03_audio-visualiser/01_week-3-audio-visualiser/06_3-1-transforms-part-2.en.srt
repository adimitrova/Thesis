00:00:04,386 --> 00:00:18,803
[SOUND]. 

2
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:23,111
So transforms are great because. 
And in fact everything if we do a 

3
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:27,272
transloate it will move everything we 
draw after but what if we do one 

4
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:33,486
translate after another like this. 
Well the most obvious thing that happens 

5
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:39,959
is that we move and move again. 
But what exactly is happening there. 

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,095
When we call the translate command. 
Everything after the call back command is 

7
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:50,605
affected by the translate including any 
other translates we do. 

8
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:57,919
So, if we look at the second the second 
translate that's a movement of any object 

9
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:04,500
that have. 
But that is also affected by the first 

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,190
translate, the first translate and its, 
and its mean to the first translate will 

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,460
happen to the second translate and the 
starting point is 0 by 0 point of the 

12
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,630
second translate will be affected that of 
the first translate. 

13
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,012
So. 
What happens is that you, the effect of 

14
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:28,440
the fir, of the first translator is 
applied to the second translator. 

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,948
Which, kind of feels more naturally like 
saying that well The second translate is 

16
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:38,991
actually happening first. 
Instead of happening to the object, and 

17
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:43,630
then it's going to be translated by the, 
by the [UNKNOWN] first translate. 

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,020
We often think of translates, transforms 
happening in the opposite order. 

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,420
So what happens if we do a translate 
followed by a rotate? 

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Well, the rotate spins around, that's 
fine. 

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,860
But if we've got a translate happening 
before that rotates. 

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,842
Then we're going to have a movement 
applies to the 0, o point of our rotate. 

23
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:07,825
So the 0-0 point of the rotate is 
going to be moved. 

24
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:11,830
in much the same way as we just saw with 
the 2 translates. 

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,804
They're applying one after the other. 
And it's kind of like they're playing 

26
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:18,476
backwards. 
But what if we do it the other way 

27
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:23,620
around? 
Well, we put a translate and movement. 

28
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,640
And then put a rotate applies to the zero 
zero point of that translate. 

29
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,540
What happens is that the zero zero of the 
translate. 

30
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,525
Is rotated relatively to the 0 0 point of 
the screen. 

31
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:47,570
So actually we're it's like, I'm taking 
an object arms length and translate it 

32
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:54,626
and then I spin it around. 
So it's spinning from the starting point 

33
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:59,320
of the translate. 
Not through the center of the object. 

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,015
So doing those two transforms in 
different orders has a radically 

35
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,754
different effect. 
If I or for example this bottle of water, 

36
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:11,746
if I apply the translate first rotate 
second which basically means the other 

37
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:16,165
way around. 
I would take and I would translate Well, 

38
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,060
I would take something and then I 
translate. 

39
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,694
I move out. 
But if I do it the other way around, then 

40
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:29,632
I translate first and then I rotate. 
And I'm making, the rotate isn't just a 

41
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,730
simply spinning around the center of the 
object. 

42
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,178
It's actually a big movement in space. 
So the first thing to remember is that 

43
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:43,190
you kind of think of them in the opposite 
order if you have to think about 

44
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,882
transforms it makes more sense to think 
they're happening backwards but the other 

45
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:55,870
thing to think about is is well, what if 
I want to move 2 objects. 

46
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,200
Well, if you want to move them together, 
that's easy, we can translate. 

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,880
But what if you got to move them 
separately. 

48
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,846
very often you'll have two objects, the 
same two cars, two crates, whatever and 

49
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,950
you just want, want to move one [UNKNOWN] 
to move the other. 

50
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,810
If I'm applying a translate. 
Then, everything that happens after that 

51
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,550
translation is going to be affected by 
it. 

52
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,519
So I translate the first object the 
circle here then the square is also going 

53
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,950
to get affect but if I want to move it 
independeantly. 

54
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:31,720
Well we use a command a called push 
matrix and pop matrix 

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,344
I won't go into the mathematical details, 
but transforms are implemented using a 

56
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:40,968
bit of maths called a matrix And when it 
call upon the pushMatrix, we're basically 

57
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:47,560
creating a new matrix that we're adding 
all our new transforms to. 

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,336
When we call popMatrix, any transforms 
that we've added since we added push, 

59
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:54,506
pushMatrix. 
[INAUDIBLE] will get canceled, because 

60
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,965
we're removing that matrix. 
So push matrix and pop matrix are a way 

61
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:03,714
of limiting the effect of transforms. 
Any, in fact, transforms that happen 

62
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:09,720
after push matrix will automatically be 
removed, once you call pop matrix. 

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,990
that [INAUDIBLE] gives you a nice way. 
Of independently moving objects. 

64
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,629
You pushmatrix, you do whatever 
transforms you like, you draw the object 

65
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,800
and then you pop matrix. 
Then the next object, you do exactly the 

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,213
same thing, pushmatrix, transform it, 
draw it and then pop matrix.
