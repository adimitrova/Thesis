[sound]. 
hello and welcome to week 3 of creative 
programming for digital media and mobile 
apps. 
this week we're going to be looking at 
audio visualization. 
so that means algorithmic drawing in 
comptuer graphics. 
so ways of making abstract shapes. 
more complex shapes with translations and 
rotations and different kinds of 
geometry. 
and audio analysis. 
so, what that really means is, 
understanding what's being played back in 
a sound and turning it into numbers which 
are useful for changing the way that 
something's drawn. 
so, there's quite a big chunk of graphics 
to do with translation, and rotation, and 
transformations, and there's a nice chunk 
of analysis. 
if you're interested in audio, and you 
have a background in audio, i think 
there's a lot of good stuff for you 
there. 
but then i'll be doing a kind of putting 
it together bit at the end. 
stuff i always do. 
just literally showing you how we combine 
analysis and combine graphics to make 
something which you might find alongside 
something like, i don't know, itunes or 
the xbox audio player. 
so, there's a market for visualizers but 
there's a market for the techniques of 
visualization. 
it's not just about making something that 
works with i tunes although there's a lot 
of money to be made in that market. 
it's also about how to how to analyze 
audio and there's an increasing amount of 
applications that really need to do that 
including stuff like shazam which is a 
really useful application. 
so, we're going to start to be thinking 
about all these things and how to put 
them together.
