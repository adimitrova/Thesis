[SOUND]. Hello and welcome to week 3 of creative 
programming for digital media and mobile apps. 
This week we're going to be looking at audio visualization. 
So that means algorithmic drawing in comptuer graphics. 
So ways of making abstract shapes. More complex shapes with translations and 
rotations and different kinds of geometry. 
And audio analysis. So, what that really means is, 
understanding what's being played back in a sound and turning it into numbers which 
are useful for changing the way that something's drawn. 
So, there's quite a big chunk of graphics to do with translation, and rotation, and 
transformations, and there's a nice chunk of analysis. 
If you're interested in audio, and you have a background in audio, I think 
there's a lot of good stuff for you there. 
but then I'll be doing a kind of putting it together bit at the end. 
Stuff I always do. just literally showing you how we combine 
analysis and combine graphics to make something which you might find alongside 
something like, I don't know, iTunes or the Xbox audio player. 
So, there's a market for visualizers but there's a market for the techniques of 
visualization. It's not just about making something that 
works with I tunes although there's a lot of money to be made in that market. 
It's also about how to how to analyze audio and there's an increasing amount of 
applications that really need to do that including stuff like shazam which is a 
really useful application. So, we're going to start to be thinking 
about all these things and how to put them together. [MUSIC]
