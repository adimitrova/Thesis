2
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:21,380
Today we're going to talk a bit more 
about moving things around in graphics. 

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,868
So in the first week we talked about how 
to draw stuff and there we could position 

4
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:30,016
objects and then like rectangles, by 
giving the pixel positions.And for 

5
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:35,483
example the white command and the ellipse 
command. 

6
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:40,074
And, and that's fine, we can do that. 
And last week we talked about doing 

7
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,602
animation, but animation with image 
sequences where we're playing lots of 

8
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:47,810
different images all in the same 
position. 

9
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,995
Today I'm going to talk about more 
powerful ways of moving objects around 

10
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:58,945
beyond what you can do simply by putting 
positions into the x y coordinates to say 

11
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:05,785
say, a rectangle. 
These techniques accord transforms, and 

12
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:10,044
there are three of them. 
The first transform is translate, which 

13
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:14,984
is a basic movement. 
Not too different from what you could do 

14
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:19,995
by putting an X-Y position into, the 
position of a rectangle, so. 

15
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:24,656
And that is a command for translate and 
you pass in an x and a y which is the 

16
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:29,554
position you're moving whatever object 
too and it's a separate command to 

17
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:35,480
whatever command drawing you're doing 
this. 

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,535
So you can apply single translate to 
multiple objects. 

19
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:43,957
And group objects together and move them 
around and I'll talk a little bit more in 

20
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:48,952
detail about how you do that. 
And the basic premise to translate an x 

21
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:53,443
and a y which gives you the position for 
which you'll translate. 

22
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,420
So very similar to what we've done 
before. 

23
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,370
The second one is a scale that's getting 
things bigger and smaller and that just 

24
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,940
basically takes a number That is how much 
of scaling apply. 

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,400
If that number's one you're not scaling 
it at all. 

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,620
If it's less than one it's getting 
smaller. 

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,090
If it's more than one it's getting 
bigger. 

28
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,055
One quite useful thing about scale is you 
can also give it two parameters which 

29
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,250
means you can scale separately about the 
x and the y. 

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,818
So, you can make something wider While 
making it sort of the same time, having 

31
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:34,049
high x scale and a small y scale. 
So the rotate command is used to spin 

32
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,260
objects around. 
And it takes an angle as its parameter. 

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,248
So that's how much you want to spin it 
by. 

34
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:50,745
the normal way we talk about angles is in 
degrees 0, 360 degrees. 

35
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:54,689
But in computer programming we often work 
with another way of dealing with angles 

36
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,330
called radians. 
Now the units we shall explain in a 

37
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,420
minute and you have to pass in that value 
and radiance through a take command. 

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,458
If you don't want to get involved in 
radians, there's a very simple command 

39
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,550
radians, that takes an angle in degrees 
and converts it to radians. 

40
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,732
So I can just put radians 90 degrees, and 
it will do it all for me. 

41
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,300
But if you want to know what radians are, 
this is it. 

42
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:25,065
So radians work in terms of a circle. 
And we can think of an angle as cutting 

43
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:29,713
out a chunk of a circle. 
So, like a, a, a slice of the pie. 

44
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:40,304
now, if we make the circle of radius one. 
So, each of these two straight edges is 

45
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:45,350
linked one. 
Then we can measure the angle by taking 

46
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,225
the length of the arc, along the way just 
to be certain, so that's how much of the 

47
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:55,970
edge of the circle is being cut out by my 
angle. 

48
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,260
And that is a perfectly good measure of, 
of, of angles, and that's what's called 

49
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,670
radians. 
A few things you need to know. 

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,210
it's useful to know particular angles in 
radians, if you ever use them. 

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,398
The, 360 degrees is the entire 
circumference of the circle, and if you 

52
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:21,501
remember from school maths And the 
circumference of a circle is two pi times 

53
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:27,342
the radius. 
Because the radius is 1, the arc length 

54
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:34,250
of 360 degrees is two pi. 
180 degrees is half that, pi. 

55
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:41,100
And 90 degrees is pi divided by two. 
So that, that's a useful way. 

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,618
Thinking about, angles, you can use, put 
values in terms of pi directly into the 

57
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:44,518
rotate command. 
But if you're not, if you don't want to 

58
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,592
get involved in that, you can also the 
radians command I just showed you to 

59
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:58,770
convert that to degrees. 
So what are transforms doing? 

60
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,726
I said. 
That transforms can apply to multiple 

61
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,320
objects and they're independent of the 
objects. 

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,660
But how does a transform know to actually 
move an object, if it's a separate 

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,040
command from do, doing so, drawing a 
rectangle or an ellipse. 

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,615
Well what a transform does is in a way 
not move just the object, but move the 

65
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:22,633
entire coordinate system. 
Sort of. 

66
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:27,190
The, the screen. 
What does that mean? 

67
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,158
Well I taught, told you a couple weeks 
ago about how we can represent any point 

68
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:37,617
on screen by an x and a y. 
How we do that is that we need to know 

69
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:41,168
which direction is x and which direction 
is y and that's normally horizontal and 

70
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:45,080
vertical. 
We can change that. 

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,580
But also, we need a starting point, we 
need to know where 0, X and 0 Y are and 

72
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,865
normally, that is top left of the screen. 
But what a translation does, is move 

73
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:01,470
that, so that anything after the 
translate. 

74
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,480
The zero-zero point. 
If I do Translate 20,100, I move my 

75
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,195
zero-zero point to 20,100. 
So, if I draw an ellipse at point say, 

76
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:22,320
20,30, if I've done a transform on that, 
Then that's 20, 30, relative to the new 

77
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,938
zero, zero points. 
So if I've transformed my 20 100s, it's 

78
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:37,739
20, 30 relative to 20, 100. 
Which is 20 plus 20, 40, 100 plus 30, 

79
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:42,570
130, relative. 
To the top left of the screen. 

80
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,490
So I'm drawing, changing the way you draw 
everything. 

81
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,582
It changes the meaning of the numbers 
you're putting into your rect command and 

82
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:53,426
direct command .And what that means is 
that if you draw both an ellipse and a 

83
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:58,128
rectangle they're both affect the same 
way. 

84
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:02,300
So you can draw as many shapes as you 
like. 

85
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,108
You can draw really complicated drawings, 
and then put a translate in front of it, 

86
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:14,132
and they'll all move together. 
Exactly the same thing with scale, but 

87
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:19,894
this time, rather than changing the 0,0 
point, you're changing how much one unit 

88
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:25,054
of x or one unit of y means, so If you 
scale up by two, each one unit you leave 

89
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:32,985
in x counts for double. 
So each time you move one in x, you're 

90
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:41,450
moving two in the original screen used. 
And finally the rotation, what that does 

91
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,190
is it actually What takes the x and y 
axis. 

92
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,690
So, it changes the direction of x and the 
direction of y. 

93
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,514
So, they're pointing in different 
directions. 

94
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:57,002
So, if I've done this translation you're 
seeing on, rotation you're seeing on the 

95
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:01,094
screen then when I move across an x I'm 
no longer moving Just horizontal and 

96
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:08,145
moving diagonal down the screen. 
So these transforms are very powerful 

97
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:15,470
because they give you new ways of 
deforming and changing shapes. 

98
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:23,812
But also because they can apply 
universally to multiple shapes.  [MUSIC].
