Hello and welcome to week 3 of creative 
programming for digital media and mobile 

3
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:25,539
apps. 
This week we're going to be looking at 

4
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,122
audio visualization. 
So that means algorithmic drawing in 

5
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:32,480
comptuer graphics. 
So ways of making abstract shapes. 

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,024
More complex shapes with translations and 
rotations and different kinds of 

7
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:41,600
geometry. 
And audio analysis. 

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,467
So, what that really means is, 
understanding what's being played back in 

9
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,475
a sound and turning it into numbers which 
are useful for changing the way that 

10
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:52,494
something's drawn. 
So, there's quite a big chunk of graphics 

11
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:56,896
to do with translation, and rotation, and 
transformations, and there's a nice chunk 

12
00:00:56,896 --> 00:01:00,658
of analysis. 
If you're interested in audio, and you 

13
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:02,596
have a background in audio, I think 
there's a lot of good stuff for you 

14
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,184
there. 
but then I'll be doing a kind of putting 

15
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:08,960
it together bit at the end. 
Stuff I always do. 

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,440
just literally showing you how we combine 
analysis and combine graphics to make 

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,792
something which you might find alongside 
something like, I don't know, iTunes or 

18
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:23,230
the Xbox audio player. 
So, there's a market for visualizers but 

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,930
there's a market for the techniques of 
visualization. 

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,966
It's not just about making something that 
works with I tunes although there's a lot 

21
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:33,220
of money to be made in that market. 
It's also about how to how to analyze 

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,739
audio and there's an increasing amount of 
applications that really need to do that 

23
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:41,340
including stuff like shazam which is a 
really useful application. 

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,696
So, we're going to start to be thinking 
about all these things and how to put 

25
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:44,892
them together. 

26
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:54,334
