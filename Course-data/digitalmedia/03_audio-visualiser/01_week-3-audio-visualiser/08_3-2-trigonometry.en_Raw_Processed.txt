last thing i want to talk today 
is another powerful mathematical function 
that we use a lot enjoying, and, the, 
functions are, trigonometry 
he, probably studied in high school 
equivalent 
three functions that relate 
to triangles 
relate angles triangles 
so, if we look slide here, weve 
got a right angled triangle 
weve got an angle a in that triangle, 
we label sides 
adjacent side, means side 
thats next to angle 
opposite side, ones opposite 
hypotenuse, is long 
long angle, long side 
triangle 
this trigonometric functions 
defined in terms three sides 
sine an angle is opposite side 
to that angle divided this hypotenuse, 
length opposite side divided 
hypotenuse 
in case tangent, also 
defined way 
now, actually going to use 
to work angles triangles, 
im going to show you something 
different 
im actually interested in working 
sine a function, a 
really instant function 
really powerful 
graphics animation, im going to show 
you 
so, if drawing circle, you 
that vertical line in circle is 
opposite angle in middle 
circle we rotate around 
so, we see drawing a circle, 
im tracing path 
actual sine function time 
drawing circle 
you see, is that angle 
is 
starts again, near zero, 
sine function zero 
gets increasingly negative, 
increasingly positive 
goes back to zero again, 
starts way around a circle 
so, repeated exactly, going 
negative, going positive 
whats powerful is that 
repetitive oscillating function 
so, goes down, down, 
time 
looks a little bit like a wave 
in fact, a important mechanism 
modeling sound wave 
sound waves act a lot like sou, sine 
waves 
in fact, we build sound wave 
a whole load si, si, sine 
functions different sizes 
frequencies 
so, we, we this 
well, we come to that, ill talk a 
little bit function 
so, this is detail sine, 
sine function, this is we would write 

using function sine, is 
calculates sine an angle, 
putting numbers in 
firstly t, we think this time, 
if youre working animation 
sounds, sine function is changing 
time 
weve got, we multiply result 
a 
thats called amplitude, thats 
high gets also low gets 
thats big sine wave is 
in audio, that is closely related to 
volume audio 
if you take, if youre listening to 
sound 
we frequency, thats 
many ups downs you get in a 
second, say, if youre dealing time 
that im showing you in 
diagram here is that distance 
one point to next identical point is one 
divided frequency wave 
finally you got phase, that, 
we really think that waves 
a starting point to sine wave, say 
off, far zero point 
actual function is starting 
you combine together different 
sine waves slightly different phases, 
you get an interesting effect 
say, youre starting one point, 
youre starting another one a little bit 
later, you combine together, 
thatll inaudible an interesting visual 
inaudible effect 
theres a lot you sine 
waves 
so, a sine wave used nicely in 
graphics 
a nice shape 
starts to look a bit like a water 
wave 
you inaudible, you could model 
water sine waves 
certainly, if you add a bunch sine 
waves together, you get quite a nice 
model it, even landscapes 
importantly you use in animation 
thats really powerful 
great thing sine wave is that 
oscillates 
goes repeatedly 
thats a really useful thing 
animating moving objects 
well see make work, work a lot 
sine wave inaudible 
great thing sine wave is, 
i said, a fantastic tool 
modeling audio functions, i think 
matthew will talk that in a later 
music music
