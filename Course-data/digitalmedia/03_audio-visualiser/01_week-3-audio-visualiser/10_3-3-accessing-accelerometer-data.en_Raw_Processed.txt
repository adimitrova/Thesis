sound 
hello 
in this lesson im going to teach you 
to access accelerometer data 
mobile device 
mobile devices an accelerometer 
in essentially allows you to 
figure angle device is 
held 
course, going to use this 
creative purposes, to control sound 
visualization 
accelerometer will give you three 
values relate to various angles 
phone, so twisted like 
this like this, like this 
so lets a look 
so, heres code will, will 
create an accelerometer print 
data 
so, lets run this phone, see 
comes 
first all, im going to type in, so 
we need top, we create a global 
variable 
type variable is 
accelerometer 
this is a builtin class 
you whove done a bit programming 
comes audio graphics 
api 
lets call, im going to call xl 
so in setup 
usually we create teh variable xy 
equals new acceleromter 
okay so thats 
going to i 
quere that accel to get 
information 
so lets example print x 
value 
okay so i an x y z value 
well we put actually 
well x is y is, z is 
okay 
i need to edit this 
so that is getx, gety, getz 
so ive got lines in draw method 
there 
so every time draw gets called going 
to ask accelerometer, is 
current x position 
whats current y position 
whats current z position 
okay, so lets run that device, 
going to look 
console to see numbers that 
coming 
right, there numbers coming 
device 
thats telling current position 
device 
if i pick 
start moving around 
you see depending angle im 
changing different numbers 
produced 
basically range is minus ten 
to ten 
so youre extreme angle 
numbers will go to ten 
and, youre opposite extreme 
theyll get a minus ten 
so values that come 
accelerator in range minus ten to 
ten depending different angles 
youre holding phone 
so we use this creatively 
well, first lets see if we 
use to set color 
background 
so going to this 
so well create variables, 
going to red, green blue 
we set red value using 
accelerometer data 
green, blue 
right 
remember, values in 
range minus to 
range, range that we need 
for, colors is to 
so well done if youve spotted that 
already i here so to get 
range to so i add 
okay that puts in range to 
then, i 
an approximation here times 

so goes to to 
okay 
thats near enough 
you calculate that accurately 
dividing 

sorry, 
so we could that 
we could to really 
accurately 
sound 
okay 
so lets that ones 
well 
sound 
right 
then, this, remember that 
that come things like 
floating point numbers 
ive declared rgbs integers 
so i need to is cast it, 
convert to an integer i use 

finally, im going to set background 
color using values r, g, b 
okay so, weve used accelerometer 
data to set red green blue 
value going to use that to 
set background color so lets hit 
play 
see happens to background 
color screen we move device 
around 
sound 
okay 
so we pick device 
i move around, you see 
background color changes 
it, seems to changing kind 
slowly, so kind jumps one 
color to next 
thats accelerometer data 
updates quite slowly 
so remember, example, audio, 
we audio data, that updates 
fast 
so you know, thats smooth 
rapid, its, types data 
slower 
so, example, frame rate in 
processing, is number times 
a second cause a draw function is, is, 
default is 
whereas number samples a second is 
, youre dealing audio 
so theres different rates of, 
data flow 
so dealing is a flow 
data a sensor in phone is 
coming in certain rate 
thats high rate in this case 
okay so that, thats dealing 
accelerometer data sending to 
background color 
in next section, im going to talk 
we map that accelerometer 
data to a playback control 
so theres a line here if youre 
quick youre going to 
pause video quickly go type 
in, see 
so lets lets put extra code 
we need to able to this line here 
ok 
so back to here 
so i need to create an audio player 
i want to control speed 
accelorometer 
so i twist phone around 
will slow speed the, 
playback audio 
so we usual thing, create 
maxim variable, create an audio player 
variable, initialize it, maxim 
equals new, maxim 
this familiar 
oops 
audio so player equals 
maximloadfile, name file 
so, im going to use the, beat weve 
using 
okay, so thats player 
so in draw method, we make sure 
player is playing 
in fact we 
so we player play 
if player is already playing we would 
ignore that 
make sure playing 
then, going to is say, 
player, set speed 
now, lets, lets a calculation here 
going to this a float, 
remember speed so if we pass in a 
speed two, will playback 
audio twice fast, so going to skip 
samples twice 
quickly 
if we, if we set speed to one will 
play back normal speed so will 
sound originally recorded 
now, so, kind of, an interesting 
range speed, weve seen 
djvj 
might zero to two 
so we need to get that accelerometer 
data, scale to range, zero to 
two 
an organizational note, that ive 
placed variables 
middle code to top 
method 
now, everyone way 
things comes to programming 
theres many ways to, to program to 
organize code 
me, i quite like to put variables 
top method so that 
really clear 
variables im going to use in 
that method 
a, a neater way to in 
mind 
so, so ive placed top 
there 
now, speed 
remember, i said an interesting range 
speed was, say, zero to two 
so going to is take that 
accelerometer data like, this, okay 
going to scale to range, 
zero to two 
so going to add ten 
so that puts in range zero to 

we divide 
that will put in range to 
so we use that set speed 
so lets see that goes 
im using x so thats twisting 
phone like this 
so hopefully this is going to is 
is if you like replace we last 
week is to touch 
screen to change speed we 
actually move phone to change 
speed 
so becomes maybe a embodied 
experience 
like a real instrument you 
move around changes sound 
so lets lets run that 
music okay so i pick phone 
you hear speeds already changing 
if i tip that way, sound you 
see 
music going really fast 
ill twist back around 
i take to a stop 
so lets try play that a 
bit 
sound so, you see becomes a 
really fun thing to and, you, 
if you got a few sounds going, you 
start really jerking phone around 
getting quite creative way you 
perform that thing 
so becomes like a rather 
being, if you like 
an interface that you tap becomes an 
instrument that you can, you really 
try to perform 
i would recommend that you try 
different sounds in there 
try record tones, try recording 
anything really sticking in there 
see if you map different properties 
sound to tellurometer data 
there 
music
