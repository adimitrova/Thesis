what
did
we
do
this
week
mick
?
what
do
we
do
?
we
built
some
audio
visualizers
.
so
yeah
we
did
some
[
unknown
]
graphics
and
we
did
some
sound
analysis
.
so
how
did
that
go
?
>
>
:
well
i
mean
the
sound
analysis
basically
you
're
just
trying
to
get
some
numbers
out
of
some
other
numbers
.
>
>
[
laugh
]
:
that
's
the
most
annoying
thing
in
the
world
.
its
quite
a
kind
of
dark
art
,
is
n't
it
?
it
's
a
dark
art
and
understanding
what
those
numbers
mean
is
what
it
's
all
about
.
>
>
yeah
.
>
>
so
i
do
n't
really
emphasize
that
some
numbers
tell
you
about
the
different
aspects
of
the
sounds
so
is
it
bassy
,
is
it
trebly
and
it
's
really
important
once
you
've
got
an
understanding
of
those
numbers
to
try
and
put
those
in
to
the
rest
of
your
applications
so
that
's
where
marco
came
in
trying
to
explain
.
the
parameterization
of
graphics
.
>
>
actually
yeah
,
there
's
a
thing
about
that
marco
we
used
a
really
basic
visualization
technique
this
week
but
there
's
lot
different
types
of
approaches
you
can
take
.
what
's
a
good
way
for
people
to
go
and
find
out
better
methods
for
drawing
stuff
.
>
>
we
'll
got
you
know
there
's
pricing
's
a
really
powerful
tool
set
you
'll
expanding
your
knowledge
of
pricing/g
,
so
there
's
a
lot
to
play
with
.
but
i
would
say
the
best
place
to
go
for
ideas
is
the
open
processing
website
.
it
's
where
people
go
to
post
their
work
they
've
done
in
processing
really
created
people
or
doing
exciting
work
and
it
's
a
fantastic
source
of
idea
and
you
can
get
the
code
there
.
some
of
it
might
be
a
little
advanced
for
you
at
the
moment
but
you
can
also
get
a
lot
ideas
not
only
what
people
can
do
,
but
how
they
did
it
.
yeah
and
it
's
good
as
well
because
those
sorts
of
techniques
they
show
you
a
lot
you
can
learn
really
fast
by
looking
at
other
peoples
code
and
it
's
nice
vital
community
.
but
speaking
of
communities
,
you
should
check
the
forums
out
if
you
have
any
questions
and
you
know
you
should
be
at
the
stage
now
where
you
should
be
able
to
help
each
other
.
and
but
ask
students
is
there
students
in
more
courses
and
if
you
've
got
anymore
questions
you
can
always
ask
.
>
>
that
's
it
for
this
week
.
we
'll
see
you
next
week
where
we
're
going
to
be
doing
a
game
.
are
n't
we
?
>
>
yes
.
[
crosstalk
]
that
's
right
.
>
>
we
are
.
so
,
we
'll
see
you
for
week
four
next
week
.
