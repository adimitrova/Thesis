sound 
in next section i going to talk 
to use audio in analysis to get 
information sound thats 
currently playing 
now, you see in this code here, that 
ive got a player im telling 
player to do, to start analyzing 
calling set analysis 
set analyzing method setting to 
true 
that will is that will cause 
player to, to begin, playing 
back, also listening to 
playing analysis there 
type analysis going to 
do, is, is called extracting in the, 
spectrum 
so going to extract power 
spectrum sound 
that mean 
well, basic idea is that you 
listen to a sound, there different 
components in that sound 
example, if you listen to heavy, 
bassy music like reggae something 
like that 
theres a lot really low frequency 
sound in there, a lot bass 
so maybe bass is a familiar term 
low frequency, right 
so if we talk base thats in 
low frequencies we also talk 
treble is makes a sound bright 
treble opposite end to bass in 
description sound 
so we talk treble midrange is 
more, things, so speech happens a lot in, 
in midrange hmm, lot 
trouble bits well 
example, if i go sound thats a lot 
of, there is a lot trouble in that 
okay, so idea is that this 
analysis we actually get 
information what, much basis in 
that, much trouble is in there so 
also we know is average, 
of, level sound 
i said method we said to 
this is fast fourier transform, 
fft 
we get data that 
turn we call a power 
spectrum, really is telling us 
much power this is in different 
frequency bands 
so is there, much bass is there, 
much bass much 
different bands bass so low bass 
medium bass 
okay 
so going to first is 
take an average 
difference frequencies 
see if we use that to, plot a 
signal meter, will show us whats 
going in sound currently 
so you see here, im pulling this 
float called pow, is average 
power in, in spectrum 
so thats looking bands, 
bass, treble, mid, taking an average 
that 
im going to set a color using 
that, following that im going to 
draw a rectangle size is set 
the, power well 
so lets code that see 
looks like 
so im going to to first deactivate 
a bit this accelerometer code 
so im going to add another float 
here 
float power okay 
remember i to say playerset 
analyzing so apologies if youre used to 
american english spelling, youre 
used to ss instead zed zeds instead 
ss 
obvious reasons, using ss 
okay 
so that will tell to start that 
analysis 
so extracting that, that, that spectrum 
so that i ask later 
so, lets that 
well leave this speed in fact im 
going to delete that code, okay 
so, lets pull power 
power equal player get average power 
okay, thats i need to to pull 
average power 
player calculates 
im going to set a fill color using 
that 
so im going to use red 
power value actually set so 
comes in range zero to one 
makes a little bit easier to 
deal in accelorameter data we 
looked 
so in range zero to one so i 
could use directly that 
so thats red component 
ok so going to set red 
im going to draw a rectangle a 
width is set power 
so again, i use a ratio if you 
like 
power times width 
so if full power, bar go 
way across 
if its, if its, it, gets 
lower, goes less less across 
youll see that in a minute 
basic idea is that will like a 
bouncing bar 
height will complete height 
screen 
right 
so lets run this device 
see new volume power meter 
looks like 
music music 
okay 
so, a bit difficult to see 
red, maybe, is a little bit, 
dim 
so im going to 
also, im filling in 
background color i go 
lets fill in background color 
wipes out, wipes 
background 
music so i made a few edits to code 
to make so that background is 
set at, is, is clear every time 
power, clearer 
music okay 
so thats, okay, thats a bit better 
mmm so theres quite a lot going in 
that sound 
so necessarily clear what, 
whats going power there 
you see there stronger, 
bursts in sound 
you see power bouncing 
lets try a different sound 
so you can, you see that there 
volume meter bounces 
power meter bounces, maybe we 
use a better sound to illustrate 
so we actually this sound we created 
previously 
called ping, i remember 
so lets run ping 
sound 
might a bit clearer whats 
going 
sound 
perhaps thats a bit clearer 
you see that hmm, parameter is 
bouncing every time ping happens 
so we covered you extract 
information spectrum, 
quite, quite lowresolution if 
you like 
telling us a lot information 
whats going 
we looked average power 
looking frequency bands 
taking average power, is 
basic, kind like, you know, loud 
is right 
if you like, allowed us to draw a 
volume meter 
now, if you want to get detail 
you actually access 
average power, you look each, 
individual band so you tell much 
bass there is, much mid range there 
is, much treble there is 
so ive got code next slide 
shows you basics to 
that 
im going to a interesting 
example in editor 
so lets look that code first so 
top code you create a 
float array called spec 
whats a float array 
well remember that float is a single 
variable store a number, 
is something like you a a 
decimal place if you like 
an accurate number think that 
way float away, you see weve got 
square brackets basically store 
lots floats 
now, that makes sense we dont, 
we want to, we dont want to store, 
so average power, we want to store 
power in every band 
so we need place we store, 
lots numbers so thats weve got 
an array there 
markers covered arrays in a previous 
lesson also you look in 
additional programming lectures to find 

in code so we asked 
player, assuming youve got a 
player created we ask to 
analysis in a draw method, we, 
exp, we, we ask power spectrum 
player 
will give us current snapshot 
whatever power spectrum is 
then, if we get something valid 
so we check if null 
so we check if we get something valid 
back 
then, if we do, we iterate that 
spectrum using a four loop 
again, four loops covered in 
detail in 
markers additional programming lectures 
so weve basically stepped every 
number in that spectrum we set a fill 
color using that draw a rectangle 
based 
i said earlier thats a basic 
example i want to a interesting 
works example going to 
is plot that spectrum time 
so you kind see a map 
sounds youve hearing time 
so we that is like this 
so weve got an audio player in draw 
method, we play usual 
that will, that wont effect it, 
itll cause to play if 
playing already 
so okay to keep calling and, 
we going to try to extract spectrum 
so first we add float spectrum 
well expect so i target slightly 
rapidly here we going to say if 
so spec equals 
player get power spectrum, like that 
if spec is input is so we got 
a valid got something plot, we type 
in a loop 
so we set a variable i to 
i to smaller spec dot link so 
i plus plus so thats going to go 
zero to whatever, many 
numbers there in that spectrum weve 
given 
okay, im going to is im 
going plot spectrum using differently 
colored dots 
so if if that, if power band is, 
is powerful, will a brightly 
colored dot 
so im going to that using stroke, 
im going to stroke color is , 
if, if will give 
us a white color, times value 
spectrum i, so goes 
through, will start base 
the, the, top end spectrum 
that is, top end array 
work array, get to 
treble end 
okay 
im going to draw a point 
now, x y position, point 
well, x position, im going to just, 
im going to use a variable actually, 
i want to is, i want to, 
time i plot this, this spectrum, im 
going to move along so that i plot 
slightly along next time 
will allow to, if you like, draw 
a map that spectrum time 
so im going to create an integer called 
xpos 
set to naught, in set so 
starts zero 
x position is going to x 
pause, y position will i 
so, i increases draws, will draw 
a line, will draw dots 
screen dot a different 
color based power that element 
so next time im going to draw, i want x 
pause to go four 
so moves along four 
since im moving along four 
so imagine im drawing kind 
dotted lines downscreen 
i want to, i also make stroke 
weight to four 
so that dots drawing, also, 
four pixels wide 
okay 
so that plot my, sound 
time across screen 
so lets 
lets run that device 
sound music okay, so you see 
its, drawn, lets stop that 
ill explain it, so you see 
drawn there is looks like a kind 
of, a bunch white plotting gray scale 
plot sort 
top that screen wherever 
bass frequencies lower 
screen gets higher pitches so 
thats that works 
youll notice there if you like 
bands, looks like there going 

bits signifying there 
a bass drum playing, a snare drum 
so that the, the, break beat kind 
a bass, snare, bass, snare sound 
you see that pattern in, in 
spectrum 
now, i want to is 
problem is that x pause eventually 
gets higher width screen 
so starts plotting edge 
screen 
so you cant see anymore 
so ill to make a final 
change is if x pos is greater width 
in words if ive moved edge 
screen 
so go back to side 
screen wipe ready to re draw 
new spectrum okay so set x so will 
move across screen 
drawing spectrum you get to 
end we go back to beginning 
so lets run that a device 
we see gets to edge 
screen it, returns to 
side starts plotting there 
sound 
so you see double base drum 
there 
dun, dun, dun, that sound 
music right 
so thats spectrum 
so you see quite dense 
top 
quite dense 
that means theres plenty bass going 
in 
theres, sort thins 
towards top end 
so you definitely see bass drums 
a kind denser sound music so 
lets stop that 
now, i encourage you try load 
different sounds there record 
load back there 
trying plotting different 
sounds you see whats going 
also layer in spectrum is perhaps 
interesting so, you might want to 
plot first 
so things in that array plot 
across whole screen so you 
really explore whats going in that 
spectrum so try different sounds 
explore spectrum fun if you 
make something interesting 
you also add interactivity so that 
slow sound speed 
see spectrum changes so thats 
i would advise you to go 
to, to explore this topic music
