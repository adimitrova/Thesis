[NOISE]. What did we do this week Mick? 
What do we do? We built some audio visualizers. 
So yeah we did some [UNKNOWN] graphics and we did some sound analysis. 
So how did that go? >> : Well I mean the sound analysis 
basically you're just trying to get some numbers out of some other numbers. 
 >> [LAUGH] :That's the most annoying thing in the world. 
Its quite a kind of dark art, isn't it? It's a dark art and understanding what 
those numbers mean is what it's all about. 
 >> Yeah. >> So I don't really emphasize that 
some numbers tell you about the different aspects of the sounds so is it bassy, is 
it trebly and it's really important once you've got an understanding of those 
numbers to try and put those in to the rest of your applications so that's where 
Marco came in trying to explain. The parameterization of graphics. 
 >> Actually yeah, there's a thing about that Marco we used a really basic 
visualization technique this week but there's lot different types of approaches 
you can take. What's a good way for people to go and 
find out better methods for drawing stuff. 
 >> We'll got you know there's Pricing's a really powerful tool set you'll 
expanding your knowledge of Pricing/g, so there's a lot to play with. 
But I would say the best place to go for ideas is the open processing website. 
It's where people go to post their work they've done in processing really created 
people or doing exciting work and it's a fantastic source of idea and you can get 
the code there. Some of it might be a little advanced for 
you at the moment but you can also get a lot ideas not only what people can do, 
but how they did it. Yeah and it's good as well because those 
sorts of techniques they show you a lot you can learn really fast by looking at 
other peoples code and it's nice vital community. 
But speaking of communities, you should check the forums out if you have any 
questions and you know you should be at the stage now where you should be able to 
help each other. And but ask students is there students in 
more courses and if you've got anymore questions you can always ask. 
 >> That's it for this week. We'll see you next week where we're going 
to be doing a game. Aren't we? 
 >> Yes. [CROSSTALK] That's right. 
 >> We are. So, we'll see you for week four next 
week.  [SOUND]
