2
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,931
The last thing I want to talk about today 
is another powerful mathematical function 

3
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:26,943
that we can use a lot enjoying, and, the, 
these functions are, trigonometry which 

4
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,800
he, probably studied in high school or 
the equivalent. 

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,555
and they are three functions that relate 
to triangles. 

6
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:41,321
relate angles and triangles. 
So, if we look at the slide here, we've 

7
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:46,147
got a right angled triangle. 
We've got an angle A in that triangle, 

8
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:50,354
and then we can label the sides. 
The adjacent side, which means the side 

9
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:55,368
that's next to the angle. 
The opposite side, ones opposite it. 

10
00:00:55,368 --> 00:01:00,660
And the hypotenuse, which is the long the 
long angle, the long side of the 

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,968
triangle. 
And this trigonometric functions are 

12
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:11,505
defined in terms of these three sides. 
The sine of an angle is the opposite side 

13
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,925
to that angle divided by this hypotenuse, 
the length of the opposite side divided 

14
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:20,380
by the hypotenuse. 
In the case of the tangent, it's also 

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,680
defined the same way. 
Now, we're not actually going to use 

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,980
these to work with angles or triangles, 
and I'm going to show you something 

17
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,698
different. 
I'm actually just interested in working 

18
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:35,100
with sine as a function, because it's a 
really instant function. 

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,014
And it's really powerful for doing 
graphics animation, and I'm going to show 

20
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,545
you what it does. 
So, if we're drawing the circle, you can 

21
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:45,705
that the vertical line in the circle is 
the opposite of the angle in the middle 

22
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:52,421
of the circle as we rotate around. 
So, we can see we're drawing a circle, 

23
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:56,142
and I'm tracing out the path of the 
actual sine function at the same time as 

24
00:01:56,142 --> 00:02:02,427
drawing the circle. 
And you can see, is that when the angle 

25
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:05,228
is. 
When it starts again, it's near zero, the 

26
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,760
sine function zero. 
It gets increasingly more negative, then 

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,060
increasingly more positive. 
And then it goes back down to zero again, 

28
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,508
and it starts the way around a circle. 
So, it repeated itself exactly, going 

29
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:24,790
negative, going positive again. 
And what's powerful about is that it's 

30
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,022
repetitive oscillating function. 
So, it goes up and down, up and down, up 

31
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:33,920
and down all the time. 
It looks a little bit like a wave. 

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,680
In fact, it's a very important mechanism 
for modeling sound wave. 

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,890
Sound waves act a lot like sou, sine 
waves. 

34
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,912
In fact, we can build up any sound wave 
out of a whole load of si, of si, of sine 

35
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,220
functions of different sizes and 
frequencies. 

36
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,888
So, what do we, what can we do with this? 
Well, before we come to that, I'll talk a 

37
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:59,340
little bit more about the function. 
So, this is More detail about the sine, 

38
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,330
sine function, this is how we would write 
it out. 

39
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,194
we're using the function sine, which is 
the calculates the sine of an angle, but 

40
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:12,342
we're putting some other numbers in. 
Firstly t, we can think of this as time, 

41
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,758
if you're working with animation with 
sounds, the sine function is changing 

42
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:25,128
over time. 
Then we've got, we multiply the result by 

43
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:27,956
A. 
That's called the amplitude, that's how 

44
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:32,662
high it gets and also how low it gets. 
That's how big the sine wave is. 

45
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:37,488
In audio, that is closely related to the 
volume of audio. 

46
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:40,680
If you take, if you're listening to 
sound. 

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,883
Then we have the frequency, that's how 
many of the ups and downs you get in a 

48
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:54,290
second, say, if you're dealing with time. 
and that what I'm showing you in the 

49
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,100
diagram here is that the distance from 
one point to next identical point is one 

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,252
divided by the frequency of wave. 
And finally you got the phase, and that, 

51
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:10,112
we can really just think of that wave's 
as a starting point to the sine wave, say 

52
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,250
how off, far off the zero point your 
actual function is starting. 

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,400
And you can combine together at different 
sine waves at slightly different phases, 

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,136
and you get an interesting effect. 
Say, you're starting one at point, and 

55
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,448
you're starting another one a little bit 
later, and you combine them together, and 

56
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:28,450
that'll [INAUDIBLE] an interesting visual 
[INAUDIBLE] effect. 

57
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,510
And there's a lot you can with sine 
waves. 

58
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,520
So, a sine wave can be used nicely in 
graphics. 

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,332
It has a nice shape. 
it starts to look a bit like a water 

60
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,515
wave. 
You can [INAUDIBLE], you could model 

61
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:44,201
water with sine waves. 
And certainly, if you add a bunch of sine 

62
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,060
waves together, you can get quite a nice 
model of it, or even landscapes. 

63
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,256
And importantly you can use in animation. 
And that's really powerful because the 

64
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:57,280
great thing about sine wave is that it 
oscillates. 

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,250
It goes up and down repeatedly. 
And that's a really useful thing for 

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,498
animating moving objects. 
And we'll see make work, work a lot with 

67
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:11,975
sine wave [INAUDIBLE]. 
The other great thing for sine wave is, 

68
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:18,319
as I said, it's a fantastic tool for 
modeling audio functions, and I think 

69
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:26,138
Matthew will talk about that in a later
