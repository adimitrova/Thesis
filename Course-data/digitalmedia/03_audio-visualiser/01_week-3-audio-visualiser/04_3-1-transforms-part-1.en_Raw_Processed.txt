today going to talk a bit 
moving things around in graphics 
so in first week we talked 
to draw stuff there we could position 
objects like rectangles, 
giving pixel positionsand 
example white command ellipse 
command 
and, thats fine, we that 
last week we talked 
animation, animation image 
sequences playing lots 
different images in 
position 
today im going to talk 
powerful ways moving objects around 
beyond you simply putting 
positions x y coordinates to say 
say, a rectangle 
techniques accord transforms, 
there three 
first transform is translate, 
is a basic movement 
different you could 
putting an xy position into, 
position a rectangle, so 
that is a command translate 
you pass in an x a y is 
position youre moving whatever object 
a separate command to 
whatever command drawing youre 
this 
so you apply single translate to 
multiple objects 
group objects together move 
around ill talk a little bit in 
detail you that 
basic premise to translate an x 
a y gives you position 
youll translate 
so similar to weve done 

second one is a scale thats getting 
things bigger smaller that 
basically takes a number that is much 
scaling apply 
if that numbers one youre scaling 

if less one getting 
smaller 
if one getting 
bigger 
one quite useful thing scale is you 
also give two parameters 
means you scale separately 
x y 
so, you make something wider while 
making sort time, 
high x scale a small y scale 
so rotate command is used to spin 
objects around 
takes an angle parameter 
so thats much you want to spin 

normal way we talk angles is in 
degrees , degrees 
in computer programming we often work 
another way dealing angles 
called radians 
units we shall explain in a 
minute you to pass in that value 
radiance a take command 
if you dont want to get involved in 
radians, theres a simple command 
radians, that takes an angle in degrees 
converts to radians 
so i put radians degrees, 
will 
if you want to know radians are, 
this is 
so radians work in terms a circle 
we think an angle cutting 
a chunk a circle 
so, like a, a, a slice pie 
now, if we make circle radius one 
so, two straight edges is 
linked one 
we measure angle taking 
length arc, along way 
to certain, so thats much 
edge circle is cut 
angle 
that is a perfectly good measure of, 
of, angles, thats whats called 
radians 
a few things you need to know 
useful to know particular angles in 
radians, if you ever use 
the, degrees is entire 
circumference circle, if you 
remember school maths 
circumference a circle is two pi times 
radius 
radius is , arc length 
degrees is two pi 
degrees is half that, pi 
degrees is pi divided two 
so that, thats a useful way 
thinking about, angles, you use, put 
values in terms pi directly 
rotate command 
if youre not, if you dont want to 
get involved in that, you also 
radians command i showed you to 
convert that to degrees 
so transforms 
i said 
that transforms apply to multiple 
objects theyre independent 
objects 
a transform know to actually 
move an object, if a separate 
command do, so, drawing a 
rectangle an ellipse 
well a transform is in a way 
move object, move 
entire coordinate system 
sort 
the, screen 
that mean 
well i taught, told you a couple weeks 
ago we represent point 
screen an x a y 
we that is that we need to know 
direction is x direction 
is y thats normally horizontal 
vertical 
we change that 
also, we need a starting point, we 
need to know , x y 
normally, that is top left screen 
a translation does, is move 
that, so that anything 
translate 
zerozero point 
if i translate ,, i move 
zerozero point to , 
so, if i draw an ellipse point say, 
,, if ive done a transform that, 
thats , , relative to new 
zero, zero points 
so if ive transformed s, 
, relative to , 
is plus , , plus , 
, relative 
to top left screen 
so im drawing, changing way you draw 
everything 
changes meaning numbers 
youre putting rect command 
direct command that means is 
that if you draw an ellipse a 
rectangle theyre affect 
way 
so you draw many shapes you 
like 
you draw really complicated drawings, 
put a translate in front it, 
theyll move together 
exactly thing scale, 
this time, rather changing , 
point, youre changing much one unit 
x one unit y means, so if you 
scale two, one unit you leave 
in x counts double 
so time you move one in x, youre 
moving two in original screen used 
finally rotation, that 
is actually takes x y 
axis 
so, changes direction x 
direction y 
so, theyre pointing in different 
directions 
so, if ive done this translation youre 
seeing on, rotation youre seeing 
screen i move across an x im 
longer moving horizontal 
moving diagonal screen 
so transforms powerful 
give you new ways 
deforming changing shapes 
also apply 
universally to multiple shapes music
