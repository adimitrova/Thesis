### TU Delft Master Thesis research project

The thesis aims to assist people to fill in metadata elements in the most efficient way based on their own budget, quality requirements etc. by providing them with a thorough research of the metadata standard in the educational field. The work also studies state-of-the-art techniques to automate or semi-automate data collection in. Having proper metadata for learning objects will increase learning content description and there after will also make the content more easily findable and re-usable. We provide metadata generation pattern by first splitting metadata into types based on commion features. Finally, we prove the provided patterns work by conducting experiment to fill in semantic metadata element (semantic = data extracted by analyzing the learning object's content). We call our element **Depth** / ** Purpose** and attempt to segment a video and classify it into one of the following categories:

- *MainConceptDescription*:  Explanation of the Main concept(s) of the LO
- *SubConceptDescription*:  Explanation of Subconcept related to the main concept
- *ConceptMention*:  Concept or other related to the LO term mentioned but not over-viewed in depth right after
- *Methodology*:   To achieve something, what should one do (related to the main concept in the LO)
- *Summary*:   It refers to a short restatement of the main points of an argument, paper, lecture, etc.
- *Application*:  Practical advise for the concept
- *Example*:   Concept example. Could be of the main or sub-concept

In the end this category will fill in the element mentioned above and this way proving the pattern we suggest for Semantic metadata extraction works and also enriches the learning content.
