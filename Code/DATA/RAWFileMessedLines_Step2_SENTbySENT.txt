Let's look at different types of data
Probably what most of us think aboutwhen we use the term data is numeric or tabular data, what researchers mightrefer to as quantitative data
And then there are other types
Samples such as DNA orblood samples, physical collections, including plant specimens,software programs and code, databases, algorithms, model, and geodatabases
Obviously, these are not allthe types of data out there
Can you think of other examples
What types have you encountered
Please share them in the forum
There are other research products thatneed to be considered alongside data in order for the data to be meaningful
These include questionnaires, code books,and descriptions of methodologies
Jillian Wallis, Elizabeth Rolando, and Christine Borgman describethis as background data
Background data provides contextualinformation important in the analysis of the primary foregrounddata collected for analysis
For example, what the temperature wasat the time a sensor reading is taken may be critical to understandingvariances in data a sensor collected
And then there are research productsbuilt on the data that are essential for secondary analysis or meta-analysis andfor content dissemination
These include reports, conference posters,articles, white papers, and books
And we should include websites and blogs
Another essential concept indata management is metadata
This is a term that you will hearme refer to throughout this course
Metadata is often definedas data about data
This, of course, is a basic and circulardefinition that may not help us too much
More specifically, metadata isstructured information that describes, explains, locates, orotherwise represents something else
For our interest in this course,that something else is, of course, our target research data
Metadata makes it easier to retrieve,use or manage an information source
Data are nothing without metadata,especially digital data
One cannot search for, identify, orinterpret data without robust metadata
For each dataset, we need to knowat minimum, who created the data, when the data were created orpublished, and a title or descriptive nameused to refer to the dataset
In this digital landscape,we also need a unique and persistent identifier forthe data so that we can locate it, even if the data are moved toa different location on the web
Beyond these metadata elements,we can increase our ability to find and identify data if we haveinformation about these, along with the other 11 metadata elements that makeup the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
Dublin Core allows us to find andidentify data
But to be able to interpret anduse data as they were intended, we also need to know quite a bit ofother information about the data
The Data Documentation Initiative, or DDI, developed a metadata schemespecifically for this purpose
Along with basic Dublin Core Elements, DDI prescribes additionalmetadata elements that provide specific informationabout data collection processes, variable-level descriptions,and methodologies.
