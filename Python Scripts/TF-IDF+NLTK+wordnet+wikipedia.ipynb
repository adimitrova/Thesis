    "we need to first discuss some basics. The most fundamental question for\n",
    "us is what are data? While this may seem like\n",
    "a straightforward question, numerous organizations have tackled it\n",
    "resulting in a range of definitions. It's important to note that data\n",
    "are different for various disciplines and different context. By the end of this lesson, you will be introduced to multiple\n",
    "types of data in an array of contexts. Data come in many forms from numeric and textual data to biological samples and\n",
    "physical collections. You will also be able to make\n",
    "the distinction between research data and other associated researcher materials. Some of which may be\n",
    "required alongside the data to understand the data themselves. And finally, and this is probably one of the most\n",
    "important concepts in the entire course. You will understand data in the context\n",
    "of the research data life cycle. To understand data management, is to\n",
    "understand data in all of its constructs. From project planning, through the\n",
    "collection of data to archiving that data as a research output after\n",
    "the project period has ended. First, let's take a look at\n",
    "how others have defined data. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH,\n",
    "define data as “recorded factual material commonly accepted in\n",
    "the scientific community as necessary to validate\n",
    "research findings.” Key concepts here include recorded and accessible data that others may look\n",
    "at to validate a studies findings. The National Science Foundation or\n",
    "NSF considers data to be something, determined by the community of interest\n",
    "through the process of peer review and project management. NSF’s definition points out the data are\n",
    "essential to the research community and not just to individual researchers or\n",
    "research teams. NSF also offers some examples of data that make the rather abstract\n",
    "definition easier to understand. As we know, examples are always useful. The NSF list includes data, publications, samples, physical collections,\n",
    "software, and models. It's interesting that NSF includes\n",
    "data as an example of data, but the point here is there are many types\n",
    "of data beyond quantitative datasets. The National Endowment for\n",
    "the Humanities, or NEH, also offers examples of data that\n",
    "includes citations, software code, algorithms, digital tools,\n",
    "documentation, databases, geospatial coordinates,\n",
    "reports and articles. It is interesting to note that NEH\n",
    "includes a wider array of data types than we see from NSF or NIH. Any of these data types NEH\n",
    "defines as humanities data, or “materials generated or collected during\n",
    "the course of conducting research.” So what are some key concepts\n",
    "in these definitions? For NIH and NSF, the research\n",
    "community establishes definitions of data that involve validity and\n",
    "presume data sharing among the community. When you look at the examples provided\n",
    "by any of these organizations, you can see that data come in\n",
    "quite a significant variety of forms, almost to the point of being nebulous. What is important to understand here is that data are products of research\n",
    "that are heterogeneous across and contextualized within\n",
    "the academic disciplines. So to reiterate,\n",
    "data should be valid, shared, and are heterogeneous, and contextualized\n",
    "within research communities.\"\"\")\n",

    "when we use the term data is numeric or tabular data, what researchers might\n",

    "need to be considered alongside data in order for the data to be meaningful. These include questionnaires, code books,\n",
    "and descriptions of methodologies. Jillian Wallis, Elizabeth Rolando, and Christine Borgman describe\n",

    "articles, white papers, and books. And we should include websites and blogs. Another essential concept in\n",
    "data management is metadata. This is a term that you will hear\n",
    "me refer to throughout this course. Metadata is often defined\n",
    "as data about data. This, of course, is a basic and circular\n",
    "definition that may not help us too much. More specifically, metadata is\n",
    "structured information that describes, explains, locates, or\n",
    "otherwise represents something else. For our interest in this course,\n",
    "that something else is, of course, our target research data. Metadata makes it easier to retrieve,\n",
    "use or manage an information source. Data are nothing without metadata,\n",
    "especially digital data. One cannot search for, identify, or\n",
    "interpret data without robust metadata. For each dataset, we need to know\n",
    "at minimum, who created the data, when the data were created or\n",
    "published, and a title or descriptive name\n",
    "used to refer to the dataset. In this digital landscape,\n",
    "we also need a unique and persistent identifier for\n",
    "the data so that we can locate it, even if the data are moved to\n",
    "a different location on the web. Beyond these metadata elements,\n",
    "we can increase our ability to find and identify data if we have\n",
    "information about these, along with the other 11 metadata elements that make\n",
    "up the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. Dublin Core allows us to find and\n",
    "identify data. But to be able to interpret and\n",
    "use data as they were intended, we also need to know quite a bit of\n",
    "other information about the data. The Data Documentation Initiative, or DDI, developed a metadata scheme\n",
    "specifically for this purpose. Along with basic Dublin Core Elements, DDI prescribes additional\n",

Communities often share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.\n",

      "With one change of the quote.txt file, all pages that include the file will display the latest daily quotation. The inclusion is not limited to files, and may also be the text output from a program, or the value of a system variable such as the current time.\n",
      "Server Side Includes are useful for including a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. Conditional navigation menus can be conditionally included using control directives.\n",
      "In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file and therefore carry out these instructions, either the filename should end with a special extension, by default .shtml, .stm, .shtm, or, if the server is configured to allow this, set the execution bit of the file.\n",
      "As a simple programming language, SSI supports only one type: text. Its control flow is rather simple, choice is supported, but loops are not natively supported and can only be done by recursion using include or using HTTP redirect. The simple design of the language makes it easier to learn and use than most server-side scripting languages, while complicated server-side processing is often done with one of the more feature-rich programming languages.

Concepts are used as formal tools or models in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence where they are sometimes called classes, schema or categories. In informal use the word concept often just means any idea.\n",

      "Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed \"superordinate\" and lower levels termed \"subordinate\". Additionally, there is the \"basic\" or \"middle\" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.

As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.\n",

      "Information reduces uncertainty. The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The bit is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits.\n",

The city has an urban area population of 1,173,179. The population of the Dublin Region, as of 2016, was 1,347,359 people, and the population of the Greater Dublin area was 1,904,806.\n",
      "There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where Dublin was established by Celtic-speaking people in the 7th century. Later expanded as a Viking settlement, the Kingdom of Dublin became Ireland's principal city following the Norman invasion. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire before the Acts of Union in 1800. Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, later renamed Ireland.\n",

      "-  java  |\t  Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is an island of Indonesia. At about 139,000 square kilometres (54,000 sq mi), the island is comparable in size to England, the U.S. State of North Carolina, or Omsk Oblast. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region), Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most populous island. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: 1) Ujung Kulon National Park, 2) Borobudur Temple, 3) Prambanan Temple, and 4) Sangiran Early Man Site.\n",
      "Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island. Three main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. Of these, Javanese is the dominant; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Furthermore, most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population is a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.\n",

      "-  machine learning  |\t  Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \"learn\" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
      "The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and computer vision.\n",
      "Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining, where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning. Machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies.\n",
      "Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to \"produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results\" and uncover \"hidden insights\" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.\n",
      "Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-  Support vector machine  |\t  In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n",
      "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
      "When data are not labeled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support vector clustering algorithm created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data, and is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in industrial applications. \n",

      "Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, never exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.\n",
      "In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments. \n",

In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n",
      "\n",
      "In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.\n",
      "Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n",
      "The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n",
      "A peculiarity of the k-NN algorithm is that it is sensitive to the local structure of the data. The algorithm is not to be confused with k-means, another popular machine learning technique. \n",

      "In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to hypocrisy, in that judging with the standards of integrity involves regarding internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding within themselves apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs. The word integrity evolved from the Latin adjective integer, meaning whole or complete. In this context, integrity is the inner sense of \"wholeness\" deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character. As such, one may judge that others \"have integrity\" to the extent that they act according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.\n",
      "Significant attention is given to the subject of integrity in law and the conception of law in 20th century philosophy of law and jurisprudence centering in part on the research of Ronald Dworkin as studied in his book Law's Empire. Dworkin's position on integrity in law reinforces the conception of justice viewed as fairness. \n",
