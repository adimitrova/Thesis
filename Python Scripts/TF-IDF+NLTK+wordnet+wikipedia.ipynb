    "the, the rules are different\n",
    "and yet, look at this\n",
    "f(x), for any value of x, right\n",
    "is 1 + x * 1 + x, right\n",
    "that's 1 + x^2\n",
    "well, i could expand this out, right\n",
    "1 * 1 + x, and then x * 1 + x\n",
    "i could combine some of these terms, right\n",
    "1 + x + x = 2x\n",

    "this one is doing something different than this function, and yet, for any input value, f's output value is this, which is the same by expanding out as g(x)\n",
    "now, how we're going to deal with this\n",
    "we're going to say that f and g are at the same function, right\n",
    "not because they have the same rule, right\n",
    "but because for every input value, they have the same output value\n",
    "here's a much more subtle example\n",
    "again, i got two functions\n",
    "f is defined like this\n",
    "f(x) = x^2 / x, and g is defined like this, g(x) is just x, the identity function\n",
    "same question, is f the same as g\n",
    "are these the same function\n",

    "so, let's see if that happens here\n",
    "let's just pick some value to get a first test\n",
    "let's take a look at f(5), right\n",
    "f(5) would be 5^2 / 5, that's 25\n",
    "5^2 / 5, that's 5\n",
    "well, that's the same as g(5), right\n",
    "if i plug anything into g, i just get the same thing out\n",
    "so, plug in five, you get five\n",
    "so, at least at the value five, f and g agree\n",
    "you might think this always works, right\n",
    "because of something like this\n",
    "you might want to say, well, f(x) that's x^2 / x, no matter what x is\n",
    "you might rewrite this x^22 as x * x / x\n",
    "and then, you'd be tempted to say, cancel one of these xes with the x in the denominator\n",
    "and then, you'd write equals x\n",
    "and x, well that's, that's g(x)\n",
    "so, this looks like a pretty convincing argument, right\n",
    "over here, i've got f of x, i've got a bunch of equal signs\n",
    "and over here, i've got g(x)\n",
    "so maybe that means f and g are the same function\n",
    "ha, but not so fast\n",
    "what happens if you plug in zero\n",
    "what's f(0)\n",
    "well, i know what g(0) is\n",

    "zero is in the domain of g because zero makes sense for this rule\n",

    "you see this is terrible, right\n",
    "i cannot divide by zero\n",
    "this rule, x^2 / x doesn't make sense when x is equal to zero\n",
    "so, zero is not in the domain of f, but it is in the domain of g\n",
    "so, i'm going to say that these are not the same function\n",
    "they don't have the same domain, right\n",
    "f isn't defined at zero, and g is defined at zero\n",
    "in that sense, these are really different functions\n",

    "then in module 6, we're actually going to go full force robotics, 100%\n",
    "and this module can be thought of as the glue module between linear systems and actual robotics\n",
    "and in fact, the title of this lecture is, switches everywhere, because so far the modules, or models have been the same all the time, and in fact, because the models are the same, we design a size fits all type of controller\n",

    "in fact, if you recall, what we talked about in module 2\n",

    "you see an obstacle, you switch to avoid that obstacle\n",
    "if you, need to go recharge you switch to a, let's look for outlets behavior\n",
    "so what we need to do is somehow come to grips, or terms with this reality\n",
    "and that is how we're going to start this module\n",
    "the first thing to note is that in the world there are switches everywhere\n",
    "so here, over on our left, is a bipedal walking robot\n",
    "well, bipedal walking robots have a leg that's swinging, has one dynamics, and then bam, the ro, the leg is on the ground, now the dynamics changed\n",
    "so because of the fact that the dynamics changes\n",
    "depending on whether or not you're in the swing face, or the stance face\n",
    "the dynamics is different\n",
    "here, i drew a cartoon of a bouncing ball\n",
    "well, it has 2 modes\n",
    "it's in the air, [sound]\n",
    "and then it bounces\n",
    "something new happens\n",
    "the b-, the ball gets squished, and then it releases again\n",
    "so, there\n",
    "we have switches\n",
    "i actually included this wonderful picture of locusts because i have actually worked on locusts\n",
    "these locusts don't bother anyone during what's called a solitary mode\n",

    "and this is a transition that occurs because of a lack of food, for instance\n",
    "but in the, all of these cases, these are naturally occurring switches that our models have to take into account\n",
    "now, from a robotics point of view, it may be slightly more relevant to look at switches by design instead of doing it by necessity\n",
    "so here is a gear box to a car\n",
    "we're switching between different gears because we want the car to run more smoothly at different rpm's\n",
    "so we're switching the dynamics not because we have to but because it's better\n",
    "here, this is a, a cockpit\n",
    "it's supposed to be representing an autopilot on an aircraft where you're switching between cruise climb turn land takeoff modes\n",
    "so, instead of designing 1 controller that takes me from atlanta, georgia to stockholm, sweden\n",
    "you have a bunch of different controllers that you're switching through in order to do this\n",
    "and at the bottom here, we have a sensor network\n",
    "where, in order to preserve power, you're turning sensors on and off on purpose\n",
    "so, you're switching by design, rather by necessity\n",
    "and, in robotics\n",
    "everywhere it switches by design\n",
    "this is our south driving georgia tech car that switches between different behaviors depending on what's happening in the world\n",
    "here's a mobile robot that switches between behaviors depending or not, whether or not there are obstacles, i wish we worked on snake robotics\n",
    "we're switching between different modes, depending on what is going on in the environment\n",
    "this is a friend in now, this is the sensor network, and this is the aerial robot that we've seen, and we're going to see more of\n",
    "in all of these cases, we're going to have to switch in order to respond to what the world throw's our way\n",
    "now, there are some issues that we need to deal with\n",
    "issue number one is really how do we model these switches\n",
    "how do we model systems that aren't staying the same all the time\n",
    "well, the other question then, of course, is if these models change, what about stability\n",
    "what about the performance\n",
    "can we go with our old methods to try to understand this\n",
    "well, this all boils down to the fact, that t does not go to infinity, within a single mode\n",
    "meaning you are not staying in 1 mode forever, and stability is defined what happens when t goes to infinity, but t does not go to infinity in the in, individual mode\n",
    "so, we somewhat need to understand that\n",
    "we also have issues of compositionality\n",
    "this is fancy speak for saying, if i have multiple modes and multiple controllers, how do i put them together\n",
    "what is the way in which they fit together like lego pieces in a big lego drawing\n",
    "and, most importantly, are there traps\n",
    "are there issues that arise because of these switches that we don't fully know how to deal with\n",

      "Frames of reference can be divided into two groups: inertial (relative motion with constant velocity) and non-inertial (accelerating, moving in curved paths, rotational motion with constant angular velocity, etc.). The term \"Lorentz transformations\" only refers to transformations between inertial frames, usually in the context of special relativity.\n",
      "In each reference frame, an observer can use a local coordinate system (most exclusively Cartesian coordinates in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity that can take measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An event is something that happens at a point in space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in spacetime. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an event as measured by an observer in each frame.\n",
      "They supersede the Galilean transformation of Newtonian physics, which assumes an absolute space and time (see Galilean relativity). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds much smaller than the speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, they reflect the fact that observers moving at different velocities may measure different distances, elapsed times, and even different orderings of events, but always such that the speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the postulates of special relativity.\n",
      "Historically, the transformations were the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of light was observed to be independent of the reference frame, and to understand the symmetries of the laws of electromagnetism. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with special relativity, but was derived before special relativity.\n",
      "The Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation. It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz transformation is called a Lorentz boost. In Minkowski space, the mathematical model of spacetime in special relativity, the Lorentz transformations preserve the spacetime interval between any two events. This property is the defining property of a Lorentz transformation. They describe only the transformations in which the spacetime event at the origin is left fixed. They can be considered as a hyperbolic rotation of Minkowski space. The more general set of transformations that also includes translations is known as the Poincaré group. \n",

For ex ante applications, additionality is evaluated for proposed activities. A proposed activity is additional if the recognized interventions are deemed to be causing the activity to take place. The occurrence of additionality is determined by assessing whether a proposed activity is distinct from its baseline.

It may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, may be operated by a moving object such as a door, or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure, temperature or flow. A switch will have one or more sets of contacts, which may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. Switches in high-powered circuits must operate rapidly to prevent destructive arcing, and may include special features to assist in rapidly interrupting a heavy current. Multiple forms of actuators are used for operation by hand or to sense position, level, temperature or flow. Special types are used, for example, for control of machinery, to reverse electric motors, or to sense liquid level. Many specialized forms exist. A common use is control of lighting, where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures.\n",

Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.\n",
      "Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous Things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.\n",

Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.\n",

As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control.\n",
      "The term comes from a Czech word, robota, meaning \"forced labor\"; the word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play R.U.R. by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek but it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor. Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate.

      "-  Support vector machine  |\t  In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n",
      "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
      "When data are not labeled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support vector clustering algorithm created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data, and is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in industrial applications. \n",

In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n",
      "\n",
      "In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n",

      "k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.\n",
      "Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n",
      "The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n",

      "Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, never exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.\n",
      "In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments. \n",

      "In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to hypocrisy, in that judging with the standards of integrity involves regarding internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding within themselves apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs. The word integrity evolved from the Latin adjective integer, meaning whole or complete. In this context, integrity is the inner sense of \"wholeness\" deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character. As such, one may judge that others \"have integrity\" to the extent that they act according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.\n",
      "Significant attention is given to the subject of integrity in law and the conception of law in 20th century philosophy of law and jurisprudence centering in part on the research of Ronald Dworkin as studied in his book Law's Empire. Dworkin's position on integrity in law reinforces the conception of justice viewed as fairness. \n",

      "-  java  |\t  Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is an island of Indonesia. At about 139,000 square kilometres (54,000 sq mi), the island is comparable in size to England, the U.S. State of North Carolina, or Omsk Oblast. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region), Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most populous island. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: 1) Ujung Kulon National Park, 2) Borobudur Temple, 3) Prambanan Temple, and 4) Sangiran Early Man Site.\n",
      "Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island. Three main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. Of these, Javanese is the dominant; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Furthermore, most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population is a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.\n",
      "Java is divided into four administrative provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta. \n",

      "-  machine learning  |\t  Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \"learn\" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
      "The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and computer vision.\n",
      "Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining, where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning. Machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies.\n",
      "Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to \"produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results\" and uncover \"hidden insights\" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.\n",
      "Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver. \n",
