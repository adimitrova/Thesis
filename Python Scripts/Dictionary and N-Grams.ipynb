    "should also be familiar with features of an embedded processor \n",
    "must remind again this course make emphasis on microcontrollers \n",
    "therefore large field of embedded processors reduced to only microcontrollers \n",
    "after learn about microcontrollers next step would be to somehow put your hands on them start actually working with them \n",
    "one way to do so to buy microcontroller breadboard set of resistors capacitors wires whatever else necessary to build proper electrical circuits assemble all circuits by yourself on breadboard \n",
    "well it does n't sound cool because it 's long process \n",
    "know there always one resistor need missing end there will be little motivation to continue playing with microcontrollers \n",
    "luckily there another option to buy ready made platform with mounted microcontroller to start working with it immediately \n",
    "this video 're going to talk about these platforms \n",
    "let 's start with arduino \n",
    "arduino widely known platform for fast prototyping \n",
    "platform uses atmel microcontrollers at its core \n",
    "overall there are about 24 boards available \n",
    "on website can find them organized according to application areas such as internet of things wearable others \n",
    "besides boards there are many shields built specifically for our arduino devices \n",
    "functionality of these shields vary lot \n",
    "for example with an mp3 shield can build your own mp3 player if need one \n",
    "wi-fi shield great tool to build applications let 's say domain of internet of things \n",
    "joystick shield suitable for control purposes \n",
    "so if want to extend functionality of board your application can plug shield \n",
    "luckily it can easily be done thanks to sockets installed arduino \n",
    "arduino also provides its own integrated development environment for software development which easy to use really speeds up development process \n",
    "second platform would like to mention stm nucleo platform \n",
    "at its core there are stx complex cortex microcontrollers from m0 to m4 \n",
    "so can choose here between speed energy consumption \n",
    "boards also have extension connectors connectors are compatible with arduino shields which very convenient \n",
    "also there so-called morpho connector for other kind of shields \n",
    "very convenient feature of this platform programmer/debugger mounted on board \n",
    "there an online id available for this platform as well as whole set of tools including operating system tools developer ecosystem for building internet of things solutions \n",
    "offline ides are also available \n",
    "they are more complex than arduino 's one but they give more freedom to developer \n",
    "would say this platform for more experienced users \n",
    "here mentioned two kinds of general purpose platforms can be extended with help of shields to target some specific areas \n",
    "there are of course more platforms available on market \n",
    "some of them target one specific area might not be extensible \n",
    "so there legit question might have \n",
    "how do select certain platform from this diversity \n",
    "first of all choice obviously should be application-oriented \n",
    "for example if want to do some digital signal processing might want to use microcontroller supports some dsp operations \n",
    "if need high computational power then cortex m4 or cortex m3 microcontrollers would suit well since they have highest clock frequency among previous mentioned mcus \n",
    "therefore your choice would be either arduino due or stm nuclear cortex m4 m3 \n",
    "if small size crucial for there no need of high performance then probably want to check arduino micro \n",
    "it also important to consider platforms are interchangeable sense same application can be implemented on two different platforms \n",
    "something would like to emphasize community crucial when it comes to choosing platform \n",
    "bigger community more likely problems might face have already been solved by someone else which case can probably find answer internet \n",
    "would like to show real project was implemented using microcontrollers \n",
    "it metering system \n",
    "imagine have tube there some liquid flowing through tube \n",
    "goal of system to measure liquid 's flow speed \n",
    "since know size of tube need to calculate volume of liquid during time interval \n",
    "finally need to store those measurements memory \n",
    "what more device should have user interface like keyboard small screen \n",
    "so where to start \n",
    "well start by dividing tasks two components metering unit control unit \n",
    "next thing to do would be to decide how to measure liquid flow speed \n",
    "this can be done using ultrasound \n",
    "need to emit an ultrasonic sound receive it back do some spectral analysis to estimate liquid flow speed \n",
    "do n't worry if do n't understand what spectral analysis \n",
    "here what want to show approach \n",
    "so need to do some digital signal processing to get liquid flow speed \n",
    "after get those measurements do some simple averaging finally store those processed measurements \n",
    "okay so have set of tasks signal processing averaging storing user interface \n",
    "it would make sense to map set of tasks onto two microcontrollers \n",
    "let 's say signal processing will be done on mcu 1 will call this part metering unit \n",
    "other tasks will run on control unit which will be implemented on mcu2 \n",
    "both parts will be connected together using uart interface \n",
    "since mcu1 does spectral analysis cortex m4 microcontroller would suit well since it has dsp extensions \n",
    "will also need an adc to sample ultrasonic signal \n",
    "on other hand mcu2 does not need to support dsp operations \n",
    "but it need to be fast enough to communicate with screen keyboard while doing averaging at same time \n",
    "it should have enough pins to work with keyboard at least two uart units to work with screen to communicate with metering unit \n",
    "cortex m3 would fit well \n",
    "it useful to leave some room for expansion \n",
    "this means might want to have some extra functionality to device future \n",
    "therefore selected microcontrollers should have enough resources terms of performance memory \n",
    "finally it important to notice system can be implemented many other ways \n",
    "this video discussed ways on how to actually start working with microcontrollers using platforms \n",
    "hopefully have an idea of how to pick an appropriate platform for your application \n",
